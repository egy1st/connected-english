00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
It's hard to believe that it's less than a year since the extraordinary moment

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
when the finance, the credit, which drives our economies froze.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
A massive cardiac arrest.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The effect, the payback, perhaps, for years of vampire predators like Bernie Madoff,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
whom we saw earlier.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Abuse of steroids, binging and so on.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And it's only a few months since governments

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
injected enormous sums of money to try and keep the whole system afloat.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And we're now in a very strange sort of twilight zone,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
where no one quite knows what's worked, or what doesn't.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We don't have any very clear maps, any compass to guide us.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
We don't know which experts to believe anymore.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
What I'm going to try and do is to give some pointers

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
to what I think is the landscape on the other side of the crisis,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
what things we should be looking out for

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and how we can actually use the crisis.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
There's a definition of leadership which says,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
"It's the ability to use the smallest possible crisis

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
for the biggest possible effect."

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And I want to talk about how we ensure that this crisis,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
which is by no means small, really is used to the full.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I want to start just by saying a bit about where I'm coming from.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I've got a very confused background

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
which perhaps makes me appropriate for confused times.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I've got a Ph.D. in Telecoms, as you can see.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I trained briefly as a Buddhist monk under this guy.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I've been a civil servant,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and I've been in charge of policy for this guy as well.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
But what I want to talk about begins when I was at this city, this university, as a student.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And then as now, it was a beautiful place of balls and punts, beautiful people,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
many of whom took to heart Ronald Reagan's comment

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
that, "even if they say hard work doesn't do you any harm,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
why risk it?"

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
But when I was here,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
a lot of my fellow teenagers were in a very different situation,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
leaving school at a time then of rapidly growing youth unemployment,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and essentially hitting a brick wall in terms of their opportunities.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And I spent quite a lot of time with them rather than in punts.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And they were people who were not short of wit, or grace or energy,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
but they had no hope, no jobs, no prospects.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And when people aren't allowed to be useful,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
they soon think that they're useless.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And although that was great for the music business at the time,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
it wasn't much good for anything else.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And ever since then, I've wondered why it is that capitalism

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
is so amazingly efficient at some things, but so inefficient at others,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
why it's so innovative in some ways and so un-innovative in others.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Now, since that time,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
we've actually been through an extraordinary boom,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
the longest boom ever in the history of this country.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Unprecedented wealth and prosperity,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
but that growth hasn't always delivered what we needed.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
H.L. Mencken once said that, "to every complex problem,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
there is a simple solution and it's wrong."

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
But I'm not saying growth is wrong,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
but it's very striking that throughout the years of growth,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
many things didn't get better.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Rates of depression carried on up, right across the Western world.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
If you look at America, the proportion of Americans

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
with no one to talk to about important things

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
went up from a tenth to a quarter.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
We commuted longer to work, but as you can see from this graph,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
the longer you commute the less happy you're likely to be.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And it became ever clearer that economic growth

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
doesn't automatically translate into social growth or human growth.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
We're now at another moment

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
when another wave of teenagers are entering a cruel job market.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
There will be a million unemployed young people here

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
by the end of the year,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
thousands losing their jobs everyday in America.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
We've got to do whatever we can to help them,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
but we've also got to ask, I think, a more profound question

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
of whether we use this crisis to jump forward

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
to a different kind of economy that's more suited to human needs,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
to a better balance of economy and society.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And I think one of the lessons of history is that

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
even the deepest crises can be moments of opportunity.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
They bring ideas from the margins into the mainstream.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
They often lead to the acceleration of much-needed reforms.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And you saw that in the '30s,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
when the Great Depression paved the way

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
for Bretton Woods, welfare states and so on.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
And I think you can see around us now,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
some of the green shoots of a very different kind of economy and capitalism

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
which could grow.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
You can see it in daily life.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
When times are hard, people have to do things for themselves,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
and right across the world, Oxford, Omaha, Omsk,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
you can see an extraordinary explosion of urban farming,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
people taking over land, taking over roofs,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
turning barges into temporary farms.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And I'm a very small part of this.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
I have 60,000 of these things in my garden.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
A few of these. This is Atilla the hen.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
And I'm a very small part of a very large movement,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
which for some people is about survival,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
but is also about values, about a different kind of economy,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
which isn't so much about consumption and credit,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
but about things which matter to us.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And everywhere too, you can see a proliferation of time banks

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
and parallel currencies,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
people using smart technologies to link up

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
all the resources freed up by the market -- people, buildings, land --

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
and linking them to whomever has got the most compelling needs.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
There's a similar story, I think, for governments.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Ronald Reagan, again, said the two funniest sentences

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
in the English language are,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
"I'm from the government. And I'm here to help."

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
But I think last year when governments did step in,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
people were quite glad that they were there, that they did act.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
But now, a few months on,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
however good politicians are at swallowing frogs

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
without pulling a face, as someone once put it,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
they can't hide their uncertainty.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Because it's already clear

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
how much of the enormous amount of money they put into the economy,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
really went into fixing the past, bailing out the banks, the car companies,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
not preparing us for the future.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
How much of the money is going into concrete and boosting consumption,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
not into solving the really profound problems we have to solve.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And everywhere, as people think about the unprecedented sums

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
which are being spent of our money and our children's money,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
now, in the depth of this crisis, they're asking:

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Surely, we should be using this with a longer-term vision

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
to accelerate the shift to a green economy,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
to prepare for aging, to deal with some of the inequalities

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
which scar countries like this and the United States

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
rather than just giving the money to the incumbents?

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Surely, we should be giving the money to entrepreneurs, to civil society,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
for people able to create the new,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
not to the big, well-connected companies,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
big, clunky government programs.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
And, after all this, as the great Chinese sage Lao Tzu said,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
"Governing a great country is like cooking a small fish.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Don't overdo it."

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And I think more and more people are also asking:

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Why boost consumption, rather than change what we consume?

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Like the mayor of São Paulo who's banned advertising billboards,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
or the many cities like San Francisco

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
putting in infrastructures for electric cars.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:23.000
You can see a bit of the same thing happening in the business world.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Some, I think some of the bankers

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
who have appear to have learned nothing and forgotten nothing.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
But ask yourselves: What will be the biggest sectors of the economy

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
in 10, 20, 30 years time? It won't be the ones lining up for handouts,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
like cars and aerospace and so on.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
The biggest sector, by far, will be health --

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
already 18 percent of the American economy,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
predicted to grow to 30, even 40 percent by mid-century.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Elder care, child care, already much bigger employers than cars.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Education: six, seven, eight percent of the economy and growing.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Environmental services, energy services, the myriad of green jobs,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
they're all pointing to a very different kind of economy

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
which isn't just about products, but is using distributed networks,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
and it's founded above all on care, on relationships,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
on what people do to other people, often one to one,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
rather than simply selling them a product.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And I think that what connects the challenge for civil society,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
the challenge for governments and the challenge for business now

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
is, in a way, a very simple one, but quite a difficult one.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
We know our societies have to radically change.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
We know we can't go back to where we were before the crisis.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
But we also know it's only through experiment

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
that we'll discover exactly how to run a low carbon city,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
how to care for a much older population,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
how to deal with drug addiction and so on.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
And here's the problem.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
In science, we do experiments systematically.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Our societies now spend two, three, four percent of GDP

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
to invest systematically in new discovery, in science, in technology,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
to fuel the pipeline of brilliant inventions

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
which illuminate gatherings like this.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
It's not that our scientists are necessarily much smarter

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
than they were a hundred years ago, maybe they are,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
but they have a hell of a lot more backing than they ever did.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And what's striking though,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
is that in society there's almost nothing comparable,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
no comparable investment,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
no systematic experiment, in the things capitalism isn't very good at,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
like compassion, or empathy, or relationships or care.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Now, I didn't really understand that until I met this guy

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
who was then an 80-year-old, slightly shambolic man

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
who lived on tomato soup and thought ironing was very overrated.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
He had helped shape Britain's post-war institutions,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
its welfare state, its economy,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
but had sort of reinvented himself as a social entrepreneur,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
became an inventor of many, many different organizations.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Some famous ones like the Open University, which has 110,000 students,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
the University of the Third Age, which has nearly half a million older people

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
teaching other older people,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
as well as strange things like DIY garages and language lines

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
and schools for social entrepreneurs.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
And he ended his life selling companies to venture capitalists.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
He believed if you see a problem, you shouldn't tell someone to act,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
you should act on it yourself, and he lived long enough

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
and saw enough of his ideas first scorned and then succeed

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.000
that he said you should always take no as a question and not as an answer.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
And his life was a systematic experiment to find better social answers,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
not from a theory, but from experiment, and experiment involving the people

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
with the best intelligence on social needs,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
which were usually the people living with those needs.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
And he believed we live with others, we share the world with others

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
and therefore our innovation must be done with others too,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
not doing things at people, for them, and so on.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Now, what he did didn't used to have a name,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
but I think it's rapidly becoming quite mainstream.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
It's what we do in the organization named after him

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
where we try and invent, create, launch new ventures,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
whether it's schools, web companies, health organizations and so on.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
And we find ourselves part of a very rapidly growing global movement

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
of institutions working on social innovation,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
using ideas from design or technology or community organizing

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
to develop the germs of a future world, but through practice and through demonstration

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
and not through theory.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
And they're spreading from Korea to Brazil to India to the USA

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
and across Europe.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:45.000
And they've been given new momentum by the crisis, by the need for better answers

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
to joblessness, community breakdown and so on.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Some of the ideas are strange.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
These are complaints choirs.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
People come together to sing about the things that really bug them.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
(Laughter)

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Others are much more pragmatic: health coaches, learning mentors, job clubs.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
And some are quite structural, like social impact bonds

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
where you raise money to invest in diverting teenagers from crime

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
or helping old people keep out of hospital,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
and you get paid back according to how successful your projects are.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Now, the idea that all of this represents,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
I think, is rapidly becoming a common sense

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
and part of how we respond to the crisis,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
recognizing the need to invest in innovation for social progress

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
as well as technological progress.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
There were big health innovation funds

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
launched earlier this year in this country,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
as well as a public service innovation lab.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Across northern Europe, many governments

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
now have innovation laboratories within them.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
And just a few months ago, President Obama

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
launched the Office of Social Innovation in the White House.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
And what people are beginning to ask is:

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Surely, just as we invest in R and D, two, three, four percent,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
of our GDP, of our economy,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
what if we put, let's say, one percent of public spending

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
into social innovation, into elder care, new kinds of education,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
new ways of helping the disabled?

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Perhaps we'd achieve similar productivity gains in society

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
to those we've had in the economy and in technology.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
And if, a generation or two ago, the big challenges

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
were ones like getting a man on the moon,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
perhaps the challenges we need to set ourselves now

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
are ones like eliminating child malnutrition, stopping trafficking,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
or one, I think closer to home for America or Europe,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
why don't we set ourselves the goal

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
of achieving a billion extra years of life for today's citizens.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Now those are all goals which could be achieved within a decade,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
but only with radical and systematic experiment,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
not just with technologies, but also with lifestyles and culture

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
and policies and institutions too.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Now, I want to end by saying a little bit about what I think this means for capitalism.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
I think what this is all about, this whole movement

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
which is growing from the margins, remains quite small.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Nothing like the resources of a CERN or a DARPA or an IBM or a Dupont.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
What it's telling us is that capitalism is going to become more social.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
It's already immersed in social networks.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:13.000
It will become more involved in social investment, and social care

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
and in industries where the value comes from what you do with others,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
not just from what you sell to them,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
and from relationships as well as from consumption.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000
But interestingly too, it implies a future where society learns a few tricks from capitalism

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
about how you embed the DNA of restless continual innovation

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:39.000
into society, trying things out and then growing and scaling the ones that work.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Now, I think this future will be quite surprising to many people.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.000
In recent years, a lot of intelligent people thought that capitalism had basically won.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
History was over

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
and society would inevitably have to take second place to economy.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
But I've been struck with a parallel in how people often talk about capitalism today

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
and how they talked about the monarchy 200 years ago,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
just after the French Revolution and the restoration of the monarchy in France.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Then, people said monarchy dominated everywhere

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
because it was rooted in human nature.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
We were naturally deferential. We needed hierarchy.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Just as today, the enthusiasts of unrestrained capitalism

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
say it's rooted in human nature,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
only now it's individualism, inquisitiveness, and so on.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Then monarchy had seen off its big challenger, mass democracy,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
which was seen as a well-intentioned but doomed experiment,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
just as capitalism has seen off socialism.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Even Fidel Castro now says that the only thing worse

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
than being exploited by multinational capitalism

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
is not being exploited by multinational capitalism.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
And whereas then monarchies, palaces and forts dominated every city skyline

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
and looked permanent and confident,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
today it's the gleaming towers of the banks which dominate every big city.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
I'm not suggesting the crowds are about to storm the barricades

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
and string up every investment banker from the nearest lamppost,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
though that might be quite tempting.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
But I do think we're on the verge of a period when,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
just as happened to the monarchy and, interestingly, the military too,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
the central position of finance capital is going to come to an end,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
and it's going to steadily move to the sides, the margins of our society,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
transformed from being a master into a servant,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
a servant to the productive economy and of human needs.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
And as that happens,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
we will remember something very simple and obvious about capitalism,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
which is that, unlike what you read in economics textbooks,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
it's not a self-sufficient system.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
It depends on other systems,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
on ecology, on family, on community,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
and if these aren't replenished, capitalism suffers too.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
And our human nature isn't just selfish, it's also compassionate.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
It's not just competitive, it's also caring.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Because of the depth of the crisis, I think we are at a moment of choice.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
The crisis is almost certainly deepening around us.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
It will be worse at the end of this year,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
quite possibly worse in a year's time than it is today.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
But this is one of those very rare moments

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
when we have to choose whether we're just pedaling furiously

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
to get back to where we were a year or two ago,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
and a very narrow idea of what the economy is for,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
or whether this is a moment to jump ahead, to reboot

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
and to do some of the things we probably should have been doing anyway.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
Thank you.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
(Applause)
