00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm a creative technologist

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and the focus of my work is on public installations.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
One of my driving passions

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
is this idea of exploring nature,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and trying to find hidden data within nature.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It seems to me that there is

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
this latent potential everywhere, all around us.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Everything gives out some kind of data,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
whether it's sound or smell or vibration.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Through my work, I've been

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
trying to find ways to harness and unveil this.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And so this basically led me to

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
a subject called cymatics.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Now, cymatics is the process of visualizing sound

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
by basically vibrating a medium such as sand or water,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
as you can see there.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
So, if we have a quick look at the history of cymatics

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
beginning with the observations of resonance,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
by Da Vinci, Galileo, the English scientist Robert Hook

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and then Ernest Chladni.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
He created an experiment using a metal plate,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
covering it with sand and then bowing it

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
to create the Chladni patterns that you see here on the right.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Moving on from this, the next person to explore this field

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
was a gentleman called Hans Jenny in the 1970s.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
He actually coined the term cymatics.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Then bringing us into the present day

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
is a fellow collaborator of mine

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and cymatics expert, John Stewart Reed.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
He's kindly recreated for us

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
the Chladni experiment.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
What we can see here is

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
the metal sheet, this time connected to a sound driver

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and being fed by a frequency generator.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
As the frequencies increase,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
so do the complexities of the patterns that appear on the plate.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
As you can see with your own eyes.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
(Applause)

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
So, what excites me about cymatics?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Well, for me cymatics is an almost magical tool.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
It's like a looking glass into a hidden world.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Through the numerous ways that we can apply cymatics,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
we can actually start to unveil the substance of things not seen.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Devices like the cymascope, which you can see here,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
have been used to scientifically observe cymatic patterns.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And the list of scientific applications is growing every day.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
For example, in oceanography,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
a lexicon of dolphin language is actually being created

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
by basically visualizing the sonar beams that the dolphins emit.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And hopefully in the future we'll be able to gain some deeper understanding

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
of how they communicate.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
We can also use cymatics for healing and education.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
This is an installation developed with school children,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
where their hands are tracked. It allows them

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
to control and position cymatic patterns

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and the reflections that are caused by them.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
We can also use cymatics as a beautiful natural art form.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
This image here is created from a snippet

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony playing through a cymatic device.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
So it kind of flips things on its head a little bit.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
This is Pink Floyd's "Machine"

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
playing in real time through the cymascope.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
We can also use cymatics as a looking glass into nature.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And we can actually recreate the archetypal forms of nature.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
So, for example, here on the left we can see a snowflake as it would appear in nature.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Then on the right we can see a cymatically created snowflake.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
And here is a starfish and a cymatic starfish.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And there is thousands of these.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
So what does this all mean?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Well, there is still a lot to explore

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
in its early days. And there's not many people working in this field.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
But consider for a moment that sound does have form.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
We've seen that it can affect matter and cause form within matter.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Then sort of take a leap and think about the universe forming.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And think about the immense sound of the universe forming.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And if we kind of ponder on that, then perhaps

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
cymatics had an influence on the formation of the universe itself.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
And here is some eye candy for you, from a range of

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
DIY scientists and artists

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
from all over the globe.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Cymatics is accessible to everybody.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
I want to urge everybody here to

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
apply your passion, your knowledge

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
and your skills to areas like cymatics.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
I think collectively we can build a global community.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
We can inspire each other.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
And we can evolve this exploration

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
of the substance of things not seen. Thank you.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
(Applause)
