WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm extremely excited to be given the opportunity

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
to come and speak to you today

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
about what I consider to be

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
the biggest stunt on Earth.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Or perhaps not quite on Earth.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
A parachute jump from the very edge of space.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
More about that a bit later on.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
What I'd like to do first is take you through

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
a very brief helicopter ride of stunts

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and the stunts industry in the movies and in television,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and show you how technology

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
has started to interface with the physical skills

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
of the stunt performer

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
in a way that makes the stunts bigger

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and actually makes them safer than they've ever been before.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I've been a professional stunt man for 13 years.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I'm a stunt coordinator. And as well as perform stunts

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I often design them.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
During that time, health and safety has become everything about my job.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
It's critical now that when a car crash happens

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
it isn't just the stunt person we make safe, it's the crew.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We can't be killing camera men. We can't be killing stunt men.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
We can't be killing anybody or hurting anybody on set,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
or any passerby. So, safety is everything.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
But it wasn't always that way.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
In the old days of the silent movies --

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Harold Lloyd here, hanging famously from the clock hands --

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
a lot of these guys did their own stunts. They were quite remarkable.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
They had no safety, no real technology.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
What safety they had was very scant.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
This is the first stunt woman,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Rosie Venger, an amazing woman.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
You can see from the slide, very very strong.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
She really paved the way

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
at a time when nobody was doing stunts, let alone women.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
My favorite and a real hero of mine is Yakima Canutt.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Yakima Canutt really formed the stunt fight.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
He worked with John Wayne and most of those old punch-ups you see

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
in the Westerns. Yakima was either there or he stunt coordinated.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
This is a screen capture from "Stagecoach,"

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
where Yakima Canutt is doing one of the most dangerous stunts I've ever seen.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
There is no safety, no back support,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
no pads, no crash mats, no sand pits in the ground.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
That's one of the most dangerous horse stunts, certainly.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Talking of dangerous stunts and bringing things slightly up to date,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
some of the most dangerous stunts we do as stunt people are fire stunts.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
We couldn't do them without technology.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
These are particularly dangerous

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
because there is no mask on my face.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
They were done for a photo shoot. One for the Sun newspaper,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
one for FHM magazine.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Highly dangerous, but also you'll notice

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
it doesn't look as though I'm wearing anything underneath the suit.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
The fire suits of old, the bulky suits, the thick woolen suits,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
have been replaced with modern materials

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
like Nomex or, more recently, Carbonex --

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
fantastic materials that enable us as stunt professionals

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
to burn for longer, look more spectacular, and in pure safety.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Here's a bit more.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
There's a guy with a flame thrower there, giving me what for.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
One of the things that a stuntman often does,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and you'll see it every time in the big movies,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
is be blown through the air.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Well, we used to use trampettes. In the old days, that's all they had.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And that's a ramp. Spring off the thing and fly through the air,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and hopefully you make it look good.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Now we've got technology. This thing is called an air ram.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
It's a frightening piece of equipment for the novice stunt performer,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
because it will break your legs very, very quickly

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
if you land on it wrong.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Having said that, it works with compressed nitrogen.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And that's in the up position. When you step on it,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
either by remote control or with the pressure of your foot,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
it will fire you, depending on the gas pressure,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
anything from five feet to 30 feet.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
I could, quite literally, fire myself into the gallery.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Which I'm sure you wouldn't want.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Not today.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Car stunts are another area

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
where technology and engineering

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
advances have made life easier for us, and safer.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
We can do bigger car stunts than ever before now.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Being run over is never easy.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
That's an old-fashioned, hard, gritty, physical stunt.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
But we have padding, and fantastic shock-absorbing things like Sorbothane --

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
the materials that help us, when we're hit like this,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
not to hurt ourselves too much.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
The picture in the bottom right-hand corner there

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
is of some crash test dummy work that I was doing.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Showing how stunts work in different areas, really.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And testing breakaway signpost pillars.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
A company makes a Lattix pillar, which is a network,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
a lattice-type pillar that collapses when it's hit.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
The car on the left drove into the steel pillar.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And you can't see it from there, but the engine was in the driver's lap.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
They did it by remote control.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
I drove the other one at 60 miles an hour, exactly the same speed,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
and clearly walked away from it.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Rolling a car over is another area where we use technology.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
We used to have to drive up a ramp, and we still do sometimes.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
But now we have a compressed nitrogen cannon.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
You can just see, underneath the car, there is a black rod on the floor

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
by the wheel of the other car.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
That's the piston that was fired out of the floor.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
We can flip lorries, coaches, buses, anything over

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
with a nitrogen cannon with enough power. (Laughs)

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
It's a great job, really. (Laughter)

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
It's such fun!

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
You should hear

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
some of the phone conversations that I have with people

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
on my Bluetooth in the shop.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
"Well, we can flip the bus over, we can have it burst into flames,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and how about someone, you know, big explosion."

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
And people are looking like this ...

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
(Laughs)

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
I sort of forget how bizarre some of those conversations are.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
The next thing that I'd like to show you is something that

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Dunlop asked me to do earlier this year

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
with our Channel Five's "Fifth Gear Show."

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
A loop-the-loop, biggest in the world.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Only one person had ever done it before.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Now, the stuntman solution to this in the old days would be,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
"Let's hit this as fast as possible. 60 miles an hour.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Let's just go for it. Foot flat to the floor."

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Well, you'd die if you did that.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
We went to Cambridge University, the other university,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
and spoke to a Doctor of Mechanical Engineering there,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
a physicist who taught us that it had to be 37 miles an hour.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Even then, I caught seven G

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
and lost a bit of consciousness on the way in.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
That's a long way to fall, if you get it wrong. That was just about right.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
So again, science helps us, and with the engineering too --

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
the modifications to the car and the wheel.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
High falls, they're old fashioned stunts.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
What's interesting about high falls

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
is that although we use airbags,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and some airbags are quite advanced,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
they're designed so you don't slip off the side like you used to,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
if you land a bit wrong. So, they're a much safer proposition.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Just basically though, it is a basic piece of equipment.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
It's a bouncy castle

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
with slats in the side to allow the air to escape.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
That's all it is, a bouncy castle.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
That's the only reason we do it. See, it's all fun, this job.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
What's interesting is we still use cardboard boxes.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
They used to use cardboard boxes years ago and we still use them.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And that's interesting because they are almost retrospective.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
They're great for catching you, up to certain heights.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And on the other side of the fence,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
that physical art, the physical performance of the stuntman,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
has interfaced with the very highest

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
technology in I.T. and in software.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Not the cardboard box, but the green screen.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
This is a shot of "Terminator," the movie.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Two stunt guys doing what I consider to be a rather benign stunt.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
It's 30 feet. It's water. It's very simple.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
With the green screen we can put any background in the world on it,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
moving or still,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
and I can assure you, nowadays you can't see the joint.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
This is a parachutist with another parachutist doing exactly the same thing.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Completely in the safety of a studio,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
and yet with the green screen we can have some moving image that a skydiver took,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
and put in the sky moving and the clouds whizzing by.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Decelerator rigs and wires, we use them a lot.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
We fly people on wires, like this.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
This guy is not skydiving. He's being flown like a kite,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
or moved around like a kite.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
And this is a Guinness World Record attempt.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
They asked me to open their 50th anniversary show in 2004.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
And again, technology meant that I could do the fastest abseil over 100 meters,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
and stop within a couple of feet of the ground

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
without melting the rope with the friction,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
because of the alloys I used in the descender device.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
And that's Centre Point in London.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
We brought Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road to a standstill.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Helicopter stunts are always fun,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
hanging out of them, whatever.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And aerial stunts. No aerial stunt would be the same without skydiving.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Which brings us quite nicely to why I'm really here today:

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Project Space Jump.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
In 1960, Joseph Kittenger of the United States Air Force

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
did the most spectacular thing.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
He did a jump from 100,000 feet, 102,000 to be precise,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
and he did it to test high altitude systems

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
for military pilots

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
in the new range of aircraft that were going up to 80,000 feet or so.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
And I'd just like to show you a little footage

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
of what he did back then.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
And just how brave he was in 1960, bear in mind.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Project Excelsior, it was called.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
There were three jumps.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
They first dropped some dummies.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
So that's the balloon, big gas balloon.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
It's that shape because the helium has to expand.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
My balloon will expand to 500 times

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
and look like a big pumpkin when it's at the top.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
These are the dummies being dropped from 100,000 feet,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
and there is the camera that's strapped to them.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
You can clearly see the curvature of the Earth at that kind of altitude.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
And I'm planning to go from 120,000 feet,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
which is about 22 miles.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
You're in a near vacuum in that environment,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
which is in minus 50 degrees.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
So it's an extremely hostile place to be.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
This is Joe Kittenger himself.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Bear in mind, ladies and gents, this was 1960.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
He didn't know if he would live or die. This is an extremely brave man.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
I spoke with him on the phone a few months ago.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
He's a very humble and wonderful human being.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
He sent me an email, saying, "If you get this thing off the ground

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
I wish you all the best." And he signed it, "Happy landings,"

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
which I thought was quite lovely.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
He's in his 80s and he lives in Florida. He's a tremendous guy.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
This is him in a pressure suit.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Now one of the challenges of going up to altitude is

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
when you get to 30,000 feet -- it's great, isn't it? --

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
When you get to 30,000 feet you can really only use oxygen.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Above 30,000 feet up to nearly 50,000 feet,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
you need pressure breathing, which is where you're wearing a G suit.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
This is him in his old rock-and-roll jeans there,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
pushing him in, those turned up jeans.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
You need a pressure suit.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
You need a pressure breathing system

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
with a G suit that squeezes you, that helps you to breathe in

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
and helps you to exhale.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Above 50,000 feet you need a space suit, a pressure suit.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Certainly at 100,000 feet no aircraft will fly.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Not even a jet engine.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
It needs to be rocket-powered or one of these things,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
a great big gas balloon.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
It took me a while; it took me years to find the right balloon team

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
to build the balloon that would do this job.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
I've found that team in America now.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
And it's made of polyethylene, so it's very thin.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
We will have two balloons for each of my test jumps,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
and two balloons for the main jump, because they

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
notoriously tear on takeoff.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
They're just so, so delicate.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
This is the step off. He's written on that thing,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
"The highest step in the world."

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
And what must that feel like?

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
I'm excited and I'm scared,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
both at the same time in equal measures.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
And this is the camera that he had on him as he tumbled

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
before his drogue chute opened to stabilize him.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
A drogue chute is just a smaller chute which helps to keep your face down.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
You can just see them there, popping open.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Those are the drogue chutes. He had three of them.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
I did quite a lot of research.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
And you'll see in a second there, he comes back down to the floor.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Now just to give you some perspective of this balloon,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
the little black dots are people.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
It's hundreds of feet high. It's enormous.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
That's in New Mexico.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
That's the U.S. Air Force Museum.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
And they've made a dummy of him. That's exactly what it looked like.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
My gondola will be more simple than that.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
It's a three sided box, basically.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
So I've had to do quite a lot of training.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
This is Morocco last year in the Atlas mountains,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
training in preparation for some high altitude jumps.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
This is what the view is going to be like

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
at 90,000 feet for me.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Now you may think this is just

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
a thrill-seeking trip, a pleasure ride,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
just the world's biggest stunt.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Well there's a little bit more to it than that.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Trying to find a space suit to do this

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
has led me to an area of technology

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
that I never really expected when I set about doing this.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
I contacted a company in the States

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
who make suits for NASA.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
That's a current suit. This was me last year with their chief engineer.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
That suit would cost me about a million and a half dollars.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
And it weighs 300 pounds and you can't skydive in it.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
So I've been stuck. For the past 15 years I've been trying to find a space suit

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
that would do this job, or someone that will make one.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Something revolutionary happened

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
a little while ago, at the same facility.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
That's the prototype of the parachute. I've now had them custom make one,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
the only one of its kind in the world. And that's the only suit of its kind in the world.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
It was made by a Russian that's designed

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
most of the suits of the past

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
18 years for the Soviets.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
He left the company because he saw,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
as some other people in the space suit industry,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
an emerging market for space suits for space tourists.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
You know if you are in an aircraft at 30,000 feet

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
and the cabin depressurizes, you can have oxygen.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
If you're at 100,000 feet you die.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
In six seconds you've lost consciousness. In 10 seconds you're dead.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Your blood tries to boil. It's called vaporization.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
The body swells up. It's awful.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
And so we expect -- it's not much fun.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
We expect, and others expect,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
that perhaps the FAA, the CAA

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
might say, "You need to put someone in a suit

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
that's not inflated, that's connected to the aircraft."

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Then they're comfortable, they have good vision, like this great big visor.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
And then if the cabin depressurizes

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
while the aircraft is coming back down,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
in whatever emergency measures, everyone is okay.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
I would like to bring Costa on, if he's here,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
to show you the only one of its kind in the world.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
I was going to wear it,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
but I thought I'd get Costa to do it, my lovely assistant.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Thank you. He's very hot. Thank you, Costa.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
This is the communication headset you'll see

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
on lots of space suits.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
It's a two-layer suit. NASA suits have got 13 layers.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
This is a very lightweight suit. It weighs about 15 pounds.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
It's next to nothing. Especially designed for me.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
It's a working prototype. I will use it for all the jumps.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Would you just give us a little twirl, please, Costa?

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Thank you very much.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
And it doesn't look far different when it's inflated,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
as you can see from the picture down there.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
I've even skydived in it in a wind tunnel,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
which means that I can practice everything I need to practice, in safety,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
before I ever jump out of anything. Thanks very much, Costa.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
(Applause)

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Ladies and gentlemen, that's just about it from me.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
The status of my mission at the moment

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
is it still needs a major sponsor.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
I'm confident that we'll find one.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
I think it's a great challenge.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
And I hope that you will agree with me,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
it is the greatest stunt on Earth.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Thank you very much for your time.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000
(Applause)
