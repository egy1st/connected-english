00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Most of the time, art and science stare at each other

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
across a gulf of mutual incomprehension.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
There is great confusion when the two look at each other.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Art, of course, looks at the world through the psyche,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the emotions -- the unconscious at times -- and of course the aesthetic.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Science tends to look at the world through the rational, the quantitative --

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
things that can be measured and described --

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
but it gives art a terrific context of understanding.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
In the Extreme Ice Survey,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
we're dedicated to bringing those two parts of human understanding together,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
to merging the art and science

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
to the end of helping us understand nature

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and humanity's relationship with nature better.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Specifically, I as a person

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
who's been a professional nature photographer my whole adult life,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
am firmly of the belief that photography, video, film

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
have tremendous powers for helping us understand

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and shape the way we think about nature

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and about ourselves in relationship to nature.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
In this project, we're specifically interested, of course, in ice.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I'm fascinated by the beauty of it, the mutability of it,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
the malleability of it,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and the fabulous shapes in which it can carve itself.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
These first images are from Greenland.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
But ice has another meaning.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Ice is the canary in the global coal mine.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
It's the place where we can see and touch and hear and feel climate change in action.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Climate change is a really abstract thing in most of the world.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Whether or not you believe in it is based on your sense of

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
is it raining more or is it raining less?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Is it getting hotter or is it getting colder?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
What do the computer models say about this, that and the other thing?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
All of that, strip it away. In the world of the arctic and alpine environments,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
where the ice is, it's real and it's present.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
The changes are happening. They're very visible.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
They're photographable. They're measurable.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
95 percent of the glaciers in the world are retreating or shrinking.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
That's outside Antarctica.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
95 percent of the glaciers in the world are retreating or shrinking,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and that's because the precipitation patterns and the temperature patterns are changing.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
There is no significant scientific dispute about that.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
It's been observed, it's measured, it's bomb-proof information.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And the great irony and tragedy of our time

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
is that a lot of the general public thinks that science is still arguing about that.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Science is not arguing about that.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
In these images we see ice from enormous glaciers,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
ice sheets that are hundreds of thousands of years old

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
breaking up into chunks, and chunk by chunk by chunk,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
iceberg by iceberg, turning into global sea level rise.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
So, having seen all of this in the course of a 30-year career,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I was still a skeptic about climate change until about 10 years ago,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
because I thought the story of climate change was based on computer models.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I hadn't realized it was based on concrete measurements

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
of what the paleoclimates -- the ancient climates -- were,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000
as recorded in the ice sheets, as recorded in deep ocean sediments,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
as recorded in lake sediments, tree rings,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
and a lot of other ways of measuring temperature.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
When I realized that climate change was real, and it was not based on computer models,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
I decided that one day I would do a project

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
looking at trying to manifest climate change photographically.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And that led me to this project.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Initially, I was working on a National Geographic assignment --

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
conventional, single frame, still photography.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And one crazy day, I got the idea that I should --

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
after that assignment was finished --

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
I got the idea that I should shoot in time-lapse photography,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
that I should station a camera or two at a glacier

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and let it shoot every 15 minutes, or every hour or whatever

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
and watch the progression of the landscape over time.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Well, within about three weeks,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
I incautiously turned that idea of a couple of time-lapse cameras

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
into 25 time-lapse cameras.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
And the next six months of my life were the hardest time in my career,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000
trying to design, build and deploy out in the field these 25 time-lapse cameras.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
They are powered by the sun. Solar panels power them.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Power goes into a battery. There is a custom made computer

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
that tells the camera when to fire.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And these cameras are positioned on rocks on the sides of the glaciers,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
and they look in on the glacier from permanent, bedrock positions,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
and they watch the evolution of the landscape.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
We just had a number of cameras out on the Greenland Ice Sheet.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.000
We actually drilled holes into the ice, way deep down below the thawing level,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
and had some cameras out there for the past month and a half or so.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Actually, there's still a camera out there right now.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
In any case, the cameras shoot roughly every hour.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Some of them shoot every half hour, every 15 minutes, every five minutes.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Here's a time lapse of one of the time-lapse units being made.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
(Laughter)

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
I personally obsessed about every nut, bolt and washer in these crazy things.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
I spent half my life at our local hardware store

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
during the months when we built these units originally.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000
We're working in most of the major glaciated regions of the northern hemisphere.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Our time-lapse units are in Alaska, the Rockies, Greenland and Iceland,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
and we have repeat photography positions,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
that is places we just visit on an annual basis,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
in British Columbia, the Alps and Bolivia.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
It's a big undertaking. I stand here before you tonight

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
as an ambassador for my whole team.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
There's a lot of people working on this right now.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
We've got 33 cameras out this moment.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
We just had 33 cameras shoot about half an hour ago

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
all across the northern hemisphere, watching what's happened.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And we've spent a lot of time in the field. It's been a fantastic amount of work.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
We've been out for two and a half years,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
and we've got about another two and a half years yet to go.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
That's only half our job.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
The other half of our job is to tell the story to the global public.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000
You know, scientists have collected this kind of information

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
off and on over the years, but a lot of it stays within the science community.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Similarly, a lot of art projects stay in the art community,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.000
and I feel very much a responsibility through mechanisms like TED,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
and like our relationship with the Obama White House,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
with the Senate, with John Kerry, to influence policy

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
as much as possible with these pictures as well.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
We've done films. We've done books. We have more coming.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
We have a site on Google Earth

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
that Google Earth was generous enough to give us,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
and so forth, because we feel very much the need to tell this story,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
because it is such an immediate evidence of ongoing climate change right now.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Now, one bit of science before we get into the visuals.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
If everybody in the developed world understood this graph,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
and emblazoned it on the inside of their foreheads,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
there would be no further societal argument about climate change

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
because this is the story that counts.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Everything else you hear is just propaganda and confusion.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Key issues: this is a 400,000 year record.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
This exact same pattern is seen going back now

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
almost a million years before our current time.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
And several things are important.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Number one: temperature and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
go up and down basically in sync.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
You can see that from the orange line and the blue line.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Nature naturally has allowed carbon dioxide to go up to 280 parts per million.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
That's the natural cycle.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Goes up to 280 and then drops

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
for various reasons that aren't important to discuss right here.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
But 280 is the peak.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Right now, if you look at the top right part of that graph,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
we're at 385 parts per million.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
We are way, way outside the normal, natural variability.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Earth is having a fever.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
In the past hundred years, the temperature of the Earth

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000
has gone up 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit, .75 degrees Celsius,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
and it's going to keep going up

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
because we keep dumping fossil fuels into the atmosphere.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
At the rate of about two and a half parts per million per year.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
It's been a remorseless, steady increase.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
We have to turn that around.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
That's the crux, and someday I hope to emblazon that

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
across Times Square in New York and a lot of other places.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
But anyway, off to the world of ice.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
We're now at the Columbia Glacier in Alaska.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
This is a view of what's called the calving face.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
This is what one of our cameras saw over the course of a few months.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
You see the glacier flowing in from the right,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
dropping off into the sea, camera shooting every hour.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
If you look in the middle background,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
you can see the calving face bobbing up and down like a yo-yo.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
That means that glacier's floating and it's unstable,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
and you're about to see the consequences of that floating.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
To give you a little bit of a sense of scale,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
that calving face in this picture

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
is about 325 feet tall. That's 32 stories.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
This is not a little cliff. This is like a major office building in an urban center.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
The calving face is the wall where the visible ice breaks off,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
but in fact, it goes down below sea level another couple thousand feet.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
So there's a wall of ice a couple thousand feet deep

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
going down to bedrock if the glacier's grounded on bedrock,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
and floating if it isn't.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Here's what Columbia's done. This is in south central Alaska.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000
This was an aerial picture I did one day in June three years ago.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
This is an aerial picture we did this year.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
That's the retreat of this glacier.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
The main stem, the main flow of the glacier is coming from the right

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
and it's going very rapidly up that stem.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
We're going to be up there in just a few more weeks,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
and we expect that it's probably retreated another half a mile,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
but if I got there and discovered that it had collapsed

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
and it was five miles further back, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Now it's really hard to grasp the scale of these places,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
because as the glaciers --

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
one of the things is that places like Alaska and Greenland are huge,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
they're not normal landscapes --

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
but as the glaciers are retreating, they're also deflating,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
like air is being let out of a balloon.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
And so, there are features on this landscape.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
There's a ridge right in the middle of the picture, up above where that arrow comes in,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
that shows you that a little bit.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
There's a marker line called the trim line

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
above our little red illustration there.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
This is something no self-respecting photographer would ever do --

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
you put some cheesy illustration on your shot, right? --

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
and yet you have to do it sometimes to narrate these points.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
But, in any case, the deflation of this glacier since 1984

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:02.000
has been higher than the Eiffel Tower, higher than the Empire State Building.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
A tremendous amount of ice has been let out of these valleys

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
as it's retreated and deflated, gone back up valley.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
These changes in the alpine world are accelerating.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
It's not static.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Particularly in the world of sea ice,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
the rate of natural change is outstripping predictions of just a few years ago,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
and the processes either are accelerating

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
or the predictions were too low to begin with.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000
But in any case, there are big, big changes happening as we speak.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
So, here's another time-lapse shot of Columbia.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
And you see where it ended in these various spring days,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
June, May, then October.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Now we turn on our time lapse.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
This camera was shooting every hour.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Geologic process in action here.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
And everybody says, well don't they advance in the winter time?

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
No. It was retreating through the winter because it's an unhealthy glacier.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Finally catches up to itself, it advances.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
And you can look at these pictures over and over again

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
because there's such a strange, bizarre fascination in seeing

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
these things you don't normally get to see come alive.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
We've been talking about "seeing is believing "

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
and seeing the unseen at TED Global.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
That's what you see with these cameras.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
The images make the invisible visible.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
These huge crevasses open up.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
These great ice islands break off --

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
and now watch this.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
This has been the springtime this year --

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
a huge collapse. That happened in about a month,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
the loss of all that ice.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
So that's where we started three years ago,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
way out on the left, and that's where we were a few months ago, the

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
last time we went into Columbia.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
To give you a feeling for the scale of the retreat,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
we did another cheesy illustration,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
with British double-decker buses.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
If you line up 295 of those nose to tail, that's about how far back that was.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
It's a long way.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
On up to Iceland.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
One of my favorite glaciers, the Sólheimajökull.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
And here, if you watch, you can see the terminus retreating.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
You can see this river being formed.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
You can see it deflating.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
Without the photographic process, you would never see this. This is invisible.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
You can stand up there your whole life and you would never see this,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
but the camera records it.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
So we wind time backwards now.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
We go back a couple years in time.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
That's where it started.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
That's where it ended a few months ago.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
And on up to Greenland.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
The smaller the ice mass, the faster it responds to climate.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Greenland took a little while to start reacting

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
to the warming climate of the past century,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
but it really started galloping along about 20 years ago.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
And there's been a tremendous increase in the temperature up there.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
It's a big place. That's all ice.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
All those colors are ice and it goes up to about two miles thick,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
just a gigantic dome that comes in from the coast and rises in the middle.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
The one glacier up in Greenland

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
that puts more ice into the global ocean

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
than all the other glaciers in the northern hemisphere combined

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
is the Ilulissat Glacier.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
We have some cameras on the south edge of the Ilulissat,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
watching the calving face as it goes through this dramatic retreat.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Here's a two-year record of what that looks like.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Helicopter in front of the calving face for scale, quickly dwarfed.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
The calving face is four and a half miles across,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
and in this shot, as we pull back, you're only seeing about a mile and a half.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
So, imagine how big this is

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
and how much ice is charging out.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
The interior of Greenland is to the right.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
It's flowing out to the Atlantic Ocean on the left.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Icebergs, many, many, many, many times the size of this building, are roaring out to sea.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
We just downloaded these pictures a couple weeks ago,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
as you can see. June 25th,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
monster calving events happened.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
I'll show you one of those in a second.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000
This glacier has doubled its flow speed in the past 15 years.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000
It now goes at 125 feet a day, dumping all this ice into the ocean.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
It tends to go in these pulses, about every three days,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
but on average, 125 feet a day,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
twice the rate it did 20 years ago.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Okay. We had a team out watching this glacier,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
and we recorded the biggest calving event that's ever been put on film.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
We had nine cameras going.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
This is what a couple of the cameras saw.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
A 400-foot-tall calving face breaking off.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Huge icebergs rolling over.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Okay, how big was that? It's hard to get it.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
So an illustration again, gives you a feeling for scale.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
A mile of retreat in 75 minutes

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
across the calving face, in that particular event, three miles wide.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
The block was three-fifths of a mile deep,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
and if you compare the expanse of the calving face

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
to the Tower Bridge in London, about 20 bridges wide.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Or if you take an American reference, to the U.S. Capitol Building

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
and you pack 3,000 Capitol Buildings into that block,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
it would be equivalent to how large that block was.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
75 minutes.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
Now I've come to the conclusion

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
after spending a lot of time in this climate change world

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000
that we don't have a problem of economics, technology and public policy.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
We have a problem of perception.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
The policy and the economics and the technology are serious enough issues,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
but we actually can deal with them.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
I'm certain that we can.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
But what we have is a perception problem

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
because not enough people really get it yet.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
You're an elite audience. You get it.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000
Fortunately, a lot of the political leaders in the major countries of the world

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000
are an elite audience that for the most part gets it now.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
But we still need to bring a lot of people along with us.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
And that's where I think organizations like TED,

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
like the Extreme Ice Survey can have a terrific impact

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
on human perception and bring us along.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
Because I believe we have an opportunity right now.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
We are nearly on the edge of a crisis,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000
but we still have an opportunity to face the greatest challenge

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
of our generation and, in fact, of our century.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
This is a terrific, terrific call to arms

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
to do the right thing for ourselves and for the future.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
I hope that we have the wisdom to let the angels of our better nature

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000
rise to the occasion and do what needs to be done. Thank you.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:56.000
(Applause)
