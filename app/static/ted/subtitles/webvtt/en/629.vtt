00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Today I want to talk to you about

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
swimming across the North Pole,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
across the most northern place in the whole world.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And perhaps the best place to start is with my late father.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
He was a great storyteller.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
He could tell a story about an event,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and so you felt you were absolutely there at the moment.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And one of the stories he told me so often when I was a young boy

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
was of the first British atomic bomb test.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
He had been there and watched it go off.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And he said that the explosion was so loud

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and the light was so intense,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
that he actually had to put his hands in front of his face to protect his eyes.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And he said that he could actually see an x-ray

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
of his fingers,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
because the light was so bright.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And I know that watching that atomic bomb going off

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
had a very, very big impact on my late father.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Every holiday I had as a young boy

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
was in a national park.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
What he was trying to do with me was to inspire me

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
to protect the world,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and show me just how fragile the world is.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
He also told me about the great explorers.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
He loved history. He would tell me about Captain Scott

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
walking all the way to the South Pole

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and Sir Edmund Hillary climbing up Mount Everest.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And so ever since I think I was just six years old,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I dreamed of going to the polar regions.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I really, really wanted to go to the Arctic.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
There was something about that place

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
which drew me to it.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And, well, sometimes it takes a long time

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
for a dream to come true.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
But seven years ago, I went to the Arctic

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
for the first time.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And it was so beautiful that I've been back there

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
ever since, for the last seven years.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I love the place.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
But I have seen that place change

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
beyond all description,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
just in that short period of time.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I have seen polar bears walking across very, very thin ice

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
in search of food.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I have swum in front of glaciers

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
which have retreated so much.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And I have also, every year,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
seen less and less sea ice.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And I wanted the world to know what was happening up there.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
In the two years before my swim,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
23 percent of the arctic sea ice cover

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
just melted away.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And I wanted to really shake the lapels of world leaders

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
to get them to understand what is happening.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
So I decided to do this symbolic swim

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
at the top of the world, in a place which should be frozen over,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
but which now is rapidly unfreezing.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And the message was very clear:

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Climate change is for real,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and we need to do something about it.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And we need to do something about it right now.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Well, swimming across the North Pole,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
it's not an ordinary thing to do.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I mean, just to put it in perspective,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
27 degrees is the temperature of a normal indoor swimming pool.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
This morning, the temperature of the English Channel was 18 degrees.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
The passengers who fell off the Titanic

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
fell into water of just five degrees centigrade.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Fresh water freezes at zero.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And the water at the North Pole is minus 1.7.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
It's fucking freezing.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
(Laughter)

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
(Applause)

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
I'm sorry, but there is no other way to describe it.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
(Laughter)

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And so I had to assemble an incredible team around me

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
to help me with this task.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.000
I assembled this team of 29 people from 10 nations.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Some people think that swimming is a very solo sport,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
you just dive into the sea and off you go.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
It couldn't be further from the truth for me.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And I then went and did a huge amount of training,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
swimming in icy water, backwards and forwards.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
But the most important thing was to train my mind

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
to prepare myself for what was going to happen.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And I had to visualize the swim.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
I had to see it from the beginning all the way to the end.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
I had to taste the salt water in my mouth.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
I had to see my coach screaming for me,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
"Come on Lewis! Come on! Go! Go! Go! Don't slow down!"

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And so I literally swam across the North Pole

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
hundreds and hundreds of times in my mind.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
And then, after a year of training, I felt ready.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
I felt confident that I could actually

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
do this swim.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
So myself and the five members of the team,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
we hitched a ride on an icebreaker

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
which was going to the North Pole.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And on day four, we decided to just do a quick

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
five minute test swim.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
I had never swum in water of minus 1.7 degrees before,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
because it's just impossible to train

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
in those types of conditions.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
So we stopped the ship, as you do.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
We all got down onto the ice,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and I then got into my swimming costume

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
and I dived into the sea.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
I have never in my life felt anything

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
like that moment.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
I could barely breathe. I was gasping for air.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
I was hyperventilating so much,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and within seconds my hands were numb.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
And it was -- the paradox is

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
that you're in freezing cold water,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
but actually you're on fire.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
I swam as hard as I could for five minutes.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
I remember just trying to get out of the water.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
I climbed out of the ice.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
And I remember taking the goggles off my face

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
and looking down at my hands in sheer shock,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
because my fingers

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
had swollen so much that they were like sausages.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
And they were swollen so much, I couldn't even close them.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
What had happened is that we are made partially of water,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
and when water freezes it expands.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
And so what had actually happened is

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
that the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And they had burst. And I was in so much agony.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
I immediately got rushed onto the ship and into a hot shower.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And I remember standing underneath the hot shower

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
and trying to defrost my fingers.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000
And I thought, in two days' time, I was going to do this swim across the North Pole.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
I was going to try and do a 20-minute swim,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
for one kilometer across the North Pole.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
And this dream which I had had ever since I was a young boy

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
with my father, was just going out the window.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000
There is no possibility that this was going to happen.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
And I remember then getting out of the shower

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
and realizing I couldn't even feel my hands.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
And for a swimmer, you need to feel your hands

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
because you need to be able to grab the water

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and pull it through with you.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
The next morning, I woke up

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
and I was in such a state of depression,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
and all I could think about was Sir Ranulph Fiennes.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
For those of you who don't know him, he's the great British explorer.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
A number of years ago, he tried to ski all the way to the North Pole.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
He accidentally fell through the ice into the sea.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
And after just three minutes in that water,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
he was able

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
to get himself out.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
And his hands were so badly frostbitten

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
that he had to return to England.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
He went to a local hospital and there they said,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
"Ran, there is no possibility

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
of us being able to save these fingers.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
We are going to actually have to take them off."

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
And Ran decided to go into his tool shed

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
and take out a saw

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
and do it himself.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
And all I could think of was, if that happened to Ran after three minutes,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
and I can't feel my hands after five minutes,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
what on earth is going to happen if I try 20 minutes?

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
At the very best, I'm going to end up losing some fingers.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
And at worst, I didn't even want to think about it.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
We carried on sailing through the ice packs towards the North Pole.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
And my close friend David, he saw the way I was thinking,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
and he came up to me and he said, "Lewis,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
I've known you since you were 18 years old.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
I've known you, and I know, Lewis,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
deep down, right deep down here,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
that you are going to make this swim.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
I so believe in you Lewis. I've seen the way you've been training.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
And I realize the reason why you're going to do this.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
This is such an important swim.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
We stand at a very, very important moment in this history,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
and you're going to make a symbolic swim here

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
to try to shake the lapels of world leaders.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Lewis, have the courage to go in there,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
because we are going to look after you every moment of it."

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
And I just, I got so much confidence from him saying that,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
because he knew me so well.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
So we carried on sailing and we arrived at the North Pole.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
And we stopped the ship,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
and it was just as the scientists had predicted.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
There were open patches of sea everywhere.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
And I went down into my cabin

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
and I put on my swimming costume.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
And then the doctor strapped on a chest monitor,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
which measures my core body temperature

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
and my heart rate.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And then we walked out onto the ice.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
And I remember looking into the ice,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
and there were big chunks of white ice in there,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
and the water was completely black.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
I had never seen black water before.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
And it is 4,200 meters deep.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
And I said to myself, "Lewis, don't look left, don't look right.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Just scuttle forward and go for it."

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And so I now want to show you a short video

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
of what happened there on the ice.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Narrator (Video): We're just sailing out of harbor now, and it's at this stage

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
when one can have a bit of a wobble mentally.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Everything just looks so gray around here,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
and looks so cold.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
We've just seen our first polar bears.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
It was absolutely magical.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
A mother and a cub, such a beautiful sight.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
And to think that in 30, 40 years

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
they could become extinct.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
It's a very frightening, very, very frightening thought.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
We're finally at the North Pole. This is

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
months and months and months of dreaming to get here,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
years of training and planning and preparation.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Ooh. In a couple of hours' time I'm going to get in here and do my swim.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
It's all a little bit frightening,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
and emotional.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Amundson, you ready? Amudson: Ready.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Lewis Pugh: Ten seconds to swim. Ten seconds to swim.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Take the goggles off. Take the goggles off!

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Man: Take the shoes. Take the shoes.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Well done lad! You did it! You did it Lewis!

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
You did it! You did it man!

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
LP: How on earth did we do that?

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Man: Against the current! You did it against the current!

00:15:50.000 --> 00:16:05.000
(Applause)

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
LP: Thank you very much. Thank you very much.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:14.000
(Applause)

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Thank you so much.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Audience: Encore!

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
(Laughter)

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
LP: I'd just like to end off by just saying this:

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
It took me four months again to feel my hands.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
But was it worth it? Yes, absolutely it was.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
There are very, very few people who don't know now

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
about what is happening in the Arctic.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
And people ask me, "Lewis, what can we do about climate change?"

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
And I say to them,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
I think we need to do three things.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
The first thing we need to do is we need to break this problem down

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
into manageable chunks.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
You saw during that video all those flags.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Those flags represented the countries

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
from which my team came from.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
And equally, when it comes to climate change,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
every single country is going to have to make cuts.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Britain, America, Japan,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
South Africa, the Congo.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
All of us together, we're all on the same ship together.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
The second thing we need to do is

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
we need to just look back

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
at how far we have come

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
in such a short period of time.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
I remember, just a few years ago, speaking about climate change,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
and people heckling me in the back

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
and saying it doesn't even exist.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
I've just come back from giving a series of speeches

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
in some of the poorest townships in South Africa

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
to young children as young as 10 years old.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Four or five children sitting behind a desk,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
and even in those poorest conditions,

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
they all have a very, very good grasp

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
of climate change.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
We need to believe in ourselves.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Now is the time to believe.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
We've come a long way. We're doing good.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
But the most important thing we must do

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
is, I think, we must all walk to the end of our lives

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.000
and turn around, and ask ourselves a most fundamental question.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000
And that is, "What type of world do we want to live in,

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
and what decision are we going to make today

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
to ensure that we all live

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
in a sustainable world?"

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very, very much.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:29.000
(Applause)
