00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
What I'm going to do, in the spirit of collaborative creativity,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
is simply repeat many of the points

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
that the three people before me have already made,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
but do them --

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
this is called "creative collaboration;"

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.000
it's actually called "borrowing" --

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
but do it through a particular perspective,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and that is to ask about the role of users and consumers

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
in this emerging world of

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
collaborative creativity

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
that Jimmy and others have talked about.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Let me just ask you, to start with,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
this simple question:

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
who invented the mountain bike?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Because traditional economic theory would say,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
well, the mountain bike was probably invented by some big bike corporation

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
that had a big R&amp;D lab

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
where they were thinking up new projects,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and it came out of there. It didn't come from there.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Another answer might be, well, it came from a sort of lone genius

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
working in his garage, who,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
working away on different kinds of bikes, comes up

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
with a bike out of thin air.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
It didn't come from there. The mountain bike

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
came from users, came from young users,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
particularly a group in Northern California,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
who were frustrated with traditional racing bikes,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
which were those sort of bikes that Eddy Merckx rode,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
or your big brother, and they're very glamorous.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
But also frustrated with the bikes that your dad rode,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
which sort of had big handlebars like that, and they were too heavy.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So, they got the frames from these big bikes,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
put them together with the gears from the racing bikes,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
got the brakes from motorcycles,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and sort of mixed and matched various ingredients.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And for the first, I don't know, three to five years of their life,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
mountain bikes were known as "clunkers."

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And they were just made in a community of bikers,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
mainly in Northern California.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And then one of these companies that was importing parts

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
for the clunkers decided to set up in business,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
start selling them to other people,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and gradually another company emerged out of that, Marin,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and it probably was, I don't know,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
10, maybe even 15, years,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
before the big bike companies

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
realized there was a market.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Thirty years later,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
mountain bike sales

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and mountain bike equipment

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
account for 65 percent of bike sales in America.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
That's 58 billion dollars.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
This is a category entirely created by consumers

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
that would not have been created by the mainstream bike market

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
because they couldn't see the need,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
the opportunity;

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
they didn't have the incentive to innovate.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
The one thing I think I disagree with

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
about Yochai's presentation

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
is when he said the Internet causes

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
this distributive capacity for innovation to come alive.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
It's when the Internet combines

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
with these kinds of passionate pro-am consumers --

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
who are knowledgeable; they've got the incentive to innovate;

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
they've got the tools; they want to --

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
that you get this kind of explosion

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
of creative collaboration.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And out of that, you get the need for the kind of things

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
that Jimmy was talking about, which is our new kinds of organization,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
or a better way to put it:

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
how do we organize ourselves without organizations?

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
That's now possible; you don't need an organization to be organized,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
to achieve large and complex tasks,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
like innovating new software programs.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
So this is a huge challenge

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
to the way we think creativity comes about.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
The traditional view, still enshrined

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
in much of the way that we think about creativity

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
-- in organizations, in government --

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
is that creativity is about special people:

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
wear baseball caps the wrong way round,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
come to conferences like this, in special places,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
elite universities, R&amp;D labs in the forests, water,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
maybe special rooms in companies painted funny colors,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
you know, bean bags, maybe the odd table-football table.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Special people, special places, think up special ideas,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
then you have a pipeline that takes the ideas

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
down to the waiting consumers, who are passive.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
They can say "yes" or "no" to the invention.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
That's the idea of creativity.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
What's the policy recommendation out of that

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
if you're in government, or you're running a large company?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
More special people, more special places.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Build creative clusters in cities;

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
create more R&amp;D parks, so on and so forth.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Expand the pipeline down to the consumers.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Well this view, I think, is increasingly wrong.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
I think it's always been wrong,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
because I think always creativity has been highly collaborative,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
and it's probably been largely interactive.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
But it's increasingly wrong, and one of the reasons it's wrong

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
is that the ideas are flowing back up the pipeline.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
The ideas are coming back from the consumers,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and they're often ahead of the producers.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Why is that?

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Well, one issue

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
is that radical innovation,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
when you've got ideas that

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
affect a large number of technologies or people,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
have a great deal of uncertainty attached to them.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
The payoffs to innovation are greatest

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
where the uncertainty is highest.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And when you get a radical innovation,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
it's often very uncertain how it can be applied.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
The whole history of telephony

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
is a story of dealing with that uncertainty.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
The very first landline telephones,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
the inventors thought

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
that they would be used for people to listen in

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
to live performances

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
from West End theaters.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
When the mobile telephone companies invented SMS,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
they had no idea what it was for;

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
it was only when that technology got into the hands

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
of teenage users

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
that they invented the use.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
So the more radical the innovation,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
the more the uncertainty,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
the more you need innovation in use

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
to work out what a technology is for.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
All of our patents, our entire approach

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
to patents and invention, is based on the idea

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
that the inventor knows what the invention is for;

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
we can say what it's for.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
More and more, the inventors of things

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
will not be able to say that in advance.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
It will be worked out in use,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
in collaboration with users.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
We like to think that invention is

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
a sort of moment of creation:

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
there is a moment of birth when someone comes up with an idea.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
The truth is that most creativity

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
is cumulative and collaborative;

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
like Wikipedia, it develops over a long period of time.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
The second reason why users are more and more important

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
is that they are the source of big, disruptive innovations.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
If you want to find the big new ideas,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
it's often difficult to find them in mainstream markets,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
in big organizations.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
And just look inside large organizations

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
and you'll see why that is so.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
So, you're in a big corporation.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
You're obviously keen to go up the corporate ladder.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Do you go into your board and say,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
"Look, I've got a fantastic idea

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
for an embryonic product

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
in a marginal market,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
with consumers we've never dealt with before,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
and I'm not sure it's going to have a big payoff, but it could be really, really big in the future?"

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
No, what you do, is you go in and you say,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
"I've got a fantastic idea for an incremental innovation

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
to an existing product we sell through existing channels

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
to existing users, and I can guarantee

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
you get this much return out of it over the next three years."

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Big corporations have an in-built tendency

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
to reinforce past success.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
They've got so much sunk in it

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
that it's very difficult for them to spot

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
emerging new markets. Emerging new markets, then,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
are the breeding grounds for passionate users.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Best example:

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
who in the music industry,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
30 years ago, would have said,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
"Yes, let's invent a musical form

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
which is all about dispossessed black men

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
in ghettos expressing their frustration

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
with the world through a form of music

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
that many people find initially quite difficult to listen to.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
That sounds like a winner; we'll go with it."

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000
(Laughter).

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
So what happens? Rap music is created by the users.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
They do it on their own tapes, with their own recording equipment;

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000
they distribute it themselves.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
30 years later,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
rap music is the dominant musical form of popular culture --

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
would never have come from the big companies.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Had to start -- this is the third point --

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
with these pro-ams.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
This is the phrase that I've used in

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
some stuff which I've done

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
with a think tank in London called Demos,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
where we've been looking at these people who are amateurs --

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
i.e., they do it for the love of it --

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
but they want to do it to very high standards.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And across a whole range of fields --

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
from software, astronomy,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
natural sciences,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
vast areas of leisure and culture

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
like kite-surfing, so on and so forth --

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
you find people who want to do things because they love it,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
but they want to do these things to very high standards.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
They work at their leisure, if you like.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
They take their leisure very seriously:

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
they acquire skills; they invest time;

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
they use technology that's getting cheaper -- it's not just the Internet:

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
cameras, design technology,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
leisure technology, surfboards, so on and so forth.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Largely through globalization,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
a lot of this equipment has got a lot cheaper.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
More knowledgeable consumers, more educated,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
more able to connect with one another,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
more able to do things together.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Consumption, in that sense, is an expression

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
of their productive potential.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Why, we found, people were interested in this,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
is that at work they don't feel very expressed.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
They don't feel as if they're doing something that really matters to them,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
so they pick up these kinds of activities.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
This has huge organizational implications

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
for very large areas of life.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Take astronomy as an example,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
which Yochai has already mentioned.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Twenty years ago, 30 years ago,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
only big professional astronomers

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
with very big telescopes could see far into space.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
And there's a big telescope in Northern England called Jodrell Bank,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
and when I was a kid, it was amazing,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
because the moon shots would take off, and this thing would move on rails.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000


And it was huge -- it was absolutely enormous.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Now, six

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
amateur astronomers, working with the Internet,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
with Dobsonian digital telescopes --

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
which are pretty much open source --

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
with some light sensors

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
developed over the last 10 years, the Internet --

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
they can do what Jodrell Bank could only do 30 years ago.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
So here in astronomy, you have this vast explosion

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
of new productive resources.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
The users can be producers.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
What does this mean, then, for our

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
organizational landscape?

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Well, just imagine a world,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
for the moment, divided into two camps.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Over here, you've got the old, traditional corporate model:

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
special people, special places;

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
patent it, push it down the pipeline

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
to largely waiting, passive consumers.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Over here, let's imagine we've got

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Wikipedia, Linux, and beyond -- open source.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
This is open; this is closed.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
This is new; this is traditional.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Well, the first thing you can say, I think with certainty,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
is what Yochai has said already --

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
is there is a great big struggle

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
between those two organizational forms.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
These people over there will do everything they can

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
to stop these kinds of organizations succeeding,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
because they're threatened by them.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
And so the debates about

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
copyright, digital rights, so on and so forth --

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
these are all about trying to stifle, in my view,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
these kinds of organizations.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
What we're seeing is a complete corruption

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
of the idea of patents and copyright.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Meant to be a way to incentivize invention,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
meant to be a way to orchestrate the dissemination of knowledge,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
they are increasingly being used by large companies

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
to create thickets of patents

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
to prevent innovation taking place.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Let me just give you two examples.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
The first is: imagine yourself going to a venture capitalist

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
and saying, "I've got a fantastic idea.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
I've invented this brilliant new program

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
that is much, much better than Microsoft Outlook."

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Which venture capitalist in their right mind is going to give you any money to set up a venture

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
competing with Microsoft, with Microsoft Outlook? No one.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
That is why the competition with Microsoft is bound to come --

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
will only come --

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
from an open-source kind of project.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
So, there is a huge competitive argument

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
about sustaining the capacity

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
for open-source and consumer-driven innovation,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
because it's one of the greatest

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
competitive levers against monopoly.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
There'll be huge professional arguments as well.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Because the professionals, over here

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
in these closed organizations --

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
they might be academics; they might be programmers;

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
they might be doctors; they might be journalists --

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
my former profession --

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
say, "No, no -- you can't trust these people over here."

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
When I started in journalism --

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Financial Times, 20 years ago --

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
it was very, very exciting

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
to see someone reading the newspaper.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
And you'd kind of look over their shoulder on the Tube

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
to see if they were reading your article.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Usually they were reading the share prices,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
and the bit of the paper with your article on

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
was on the floor, or something like that,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
and you know, "For heaven's sake, what are they doing!

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
They're not reading my brilliant article!"

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
And we allowed users, readers,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
two places where they could contribute to the paper:

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
the letters page, where they could write a letter in,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
and we would condescend to them, cut it in half,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
and print it three days later.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Or the op-ed page, where if they knew the editor --

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
had been to school with him, slept with his wife --

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
they could write an article for the op-ed page.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Those were the two places.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Shock, horror: now, the readers want to be writers and publishers.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
That's not their role; they're supposed to read what we write.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
But they don't want to be journalists. The journalists think

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
that the bloggers want to be journalists;

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
they don't want to be journalists; they just want to have a voice.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
They want to, as Jimmy said, they want to have a dialogue, a conversation.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
They want to be part of that flow of information.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
What's happening there is that the whole domain

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
of creativity is expanding.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
So, there's going to be a tremendous struggle.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
But, also, there's going to be tremendous movement

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
from the open to the closed.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
What you'll see, I think, is two things that are critical,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
and these, I think, are two challenges

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
for the open movement.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
The first is:

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
can we really survive on volunteers?

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
If this is so critical,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
do we not need it funded, organized, supported

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
in much more structured ways?

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
I think the idea of creating the Red Cross

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
for information and knowledge is a fantastic idea,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
but can we really organize that, just on volunteers?

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
What kind of changes do we need in public policy

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
and funding to make that possible?

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
What's the role of the BBC,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
for instance, in that world?

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
What should be the role of public policy?

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
And finally, what I think you will see

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
is the intelligent, closed organizations

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
moving increasingly in the open direction.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
So it's not going to be a contest between two camps,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
but, in between them, you'll find all sorts of interesting places

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
that people will occupy.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
New organizational models coming about,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
mixing closed and open in tricky ways.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
It won't be so clear-cut; it won't be Microsoft versus Linux --

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
there'll be all sorts of things in between.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
And those organizational models, it turns out,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
are incredibly powerful,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
and the people who can understand them

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
will be very, very successful.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Let me just give you one final example

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
of what that means.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
I was in Shanghai,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
in an office block

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
built on what was a rice paddy five years ago --

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
one of the 2,500 skyscrapers

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
they've built in Shanghai in the last 10 years.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
And I was having dinner with this guy called Timothy Chan.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Timothy Chan set up an Internet business

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
in 2000.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
Didn't go into the Internet, kept his money,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
decided to go into computer games.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
He runs a company called Shanda,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
which is the largest computer games company in China.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Nine thousand servers all over China,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
has 250 million subscribers.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
At any one time, there are four million people playing one of his games.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
How many people does he employ

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
to service that population?

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
500 people.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Well, how can he service

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
250 million people from 500 employees?

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Because basically, he doesn't service them.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
He gives them a platform;

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
he gives them some rules; he gives them the tools

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
and then he kind of orchestrates the conversation;

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
he orchestrates the action.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
But actually, a lot of the content

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
is created by the users themselves.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
And it creates a kind of stickiness

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
between the community and the company

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
which is really, really powerful.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
The best measure of that: so you go into one of his games,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
you create a character

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
that you develop in the course of the game.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
If, for some reason, your credit card bounces,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
or there's some other problem,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
you lose your character.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
You've got two options.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
One option: you can create a new character,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
right from scratch, but with none of the history of your player.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
That costs about 100 dollars.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Or you can get on a plane, fly to Shanghai,

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
queue up outside Shanda's offices --

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
cost probably 600, 700 dollars --

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
and reclaim your character, get your history back.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Every morning, there are 600 people queuing

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
outside their offices

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
to reclaim these characters. (Laughter)

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
So this is about companies built on communities,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
that provide communities with tools,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
resources, platforms in which they can share.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
He's not open source,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
but it's very, very powerful.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
So here is one of the challenges, I think,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
for people like me, who

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
do a lot of work with government.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
If you're a games company,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
and you've got a million players in your game,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
you only need one percent of them

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
to be co-developers, contributing ideas,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
and you've got a development workforce

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
of 10,000 people.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Imagine you could take all the children

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
in education in Britain, and one percent of them

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
were co-developers of education.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
What would that do to the resources available

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
to the education system?

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
Or if you got one percent of the patients in the NHS

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
to, in some sense, be co-producers of health.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
The reason why --

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
despite all the efforts to cut it down,

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
to constrain it, to hold it back --

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
why these open models will still start emerging

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
with tremendous force,

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
is that they multiply our productive resources.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
And one of the reasons they do that

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
is that they turn users into producers,

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
consumers into designers.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Thank you very much.
