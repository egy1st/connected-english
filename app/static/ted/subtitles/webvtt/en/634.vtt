00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The public debate about architecture

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
quite often just stays on contemplating the final result,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
the architectural object.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Is the latest tower in London

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
a gherkin or a sausage

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
or a sex tool?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So recently, we asked ourselves

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
if we could invent a format

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
that could actually tell the stories behind the projects,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
maybe combining images and drawings and words

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
to actually sort of tell stories about architecture.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And we discovered that we didn't have to invent it,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
it already existed in the form of a comic book.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So we basically copied the format of the comic book

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
to actually tell the stories of behind the scenes,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
how our projects actually evolve through adaptation

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and improvisation.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Sort of through the turmoil and the opportunities

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and the incidents of the real world.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
We call this comic book "Yes is More,"

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
which is obviously a sort of evolution of the ideas of some of our heroes.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
In this case it's Mies van der Rohe's Less is More.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
He triggered the modernist revolution.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
After him followed the post-modern counter-revolution,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Robert Venturi saying, "Less is a bore."

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
After him, Philip Johnson sort of introduced

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
(Laughter)

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
you could say promiscuity, or at least openness

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
to new ideas with, "I am a whore."

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Recently, Obama has introduced optimism

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
at a sort of time of global financial crisis.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And what we'd like to say with "Yes is More"

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
is basically trying to question this idea

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
that the architectural avant-garde is almost always negatively defined,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
as who or what we are against.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
The cliche of the radical architect

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
is the sort of angry young man rebelling against the establishment.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Or this idea of the misunderstood genius,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
frustrated that the world doesn't fit in with his or her ideas.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Rather than revolution, we're much more interested in evolution,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
this idea that things gradually evolve

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
by adapting and improvising

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
to the changes of the world.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
In fact, I actually think that Darwin is one of the people

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
who best explains our design process.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
His famous evolutionary tree

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
could almost be a diagram of the way we work.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
As you can see, a project evolves through

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
a series of generations of design meetings.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
At each meeting, there's way too many ideas.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Only the best ones can survive.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And through a process of architectural selection,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
we might choose a really beautiful model

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
or we might have a very functional model.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
We mate them. They have sort of mutant offspring.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And through these sort of generations of design meetings

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
we arrive at a design.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
A very literal way of showing it is a project we did

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
for a library and a hotel in Copenhagen.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
The design process was really tough,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
almost like a struggle for survival,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
but gradually an idea evolved:

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
this sort of idea of a rational tower

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
that melts together with the surrounding city,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
sort of expanding the public space onto what we refer to as

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
a Scandinavian version of the Spanish Steps in Rome,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
but sort of public on the outside, as well as on the inside,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
with the library.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
But Darwin doesn't only explain the evolution of a single idea.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
As you can see, sometimes a subspecies branches off.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And quite often we sit in a design meeting

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
and we discover that there is this great idea.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
It doesn't really work in this context.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
But for another client in another culture,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
it could really be the right answer to a different question.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
So as a result, we never throw anything out.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
We keep our office almost like an archive

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
of architectural biodiversity.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
You never know when you might need it.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And what I'd like to do now, in an act of

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
warp-speed storytelling,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
is tell the story of how two projects evolved

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
by adapting and improvising

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
to the happenstance of the world.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
The first story starts last year when we went to Shanghai

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
to do the competition for the Danish

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
National Pavilion for the World Expo in 2010.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
And we saw this guy, Haibao.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
He's the mascot of the expo,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and he looks strangely familiar.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
In fact he looked like a building we had designed

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
for a hotel in the north of Sweden.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
When we submitted it for the Swedish competition we thought

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
it was a really cool scheme, but it didn't exactly

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
look like something from the north of Sweden.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
The Swedish jury didn't think so either. So we lost.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
But then we had a meeting with a Chinese businessman

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
who saw our design and said,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
"Wow, that's the Chinese character for the word 'people.'"

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
(Laughter)

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
So, apparently this is how you write "people,"

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
as in the People's Republic of China.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
We even double checked.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And at the same time, we got invited to exhibit

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
at the Shanghai Creative Industry Week.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
So we thought like, this is too much of an opportunity,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
so we hired a feng shui master.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
We scaled the building up three times to Chinese proportions,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
and went to China.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
(Laughter)

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
So the People's Building, as we called it.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
This is our two interpreters, sort of reading the architecture.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
It went on the cover of the Wen Wei Po newspaper,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
which got Mr. Liangyu Chen, the mayor of Shanghai,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
to visit the exhibition.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
And we had the chance to explain the project.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And he said, "Shanghai is the city in the world

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
with most skyscrapers,"

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
but to him it was as if the connection to the roots had been cut over.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
And with the People's Building, he saw an architecture

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
that could bridge the gap between the ancient wisdom of China

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
and the progressive future of China.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
So we obviously profoundly agreed with him.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
(Laughter)

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
(Applause)

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Unfortunately, Mr. Chen is now in prison for corruption.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
(Laughter)

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
But like I said, Haibao looked very familiar,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
because he is actually the Chinese character for "people."

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And they chose this mascot because

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
the theme of the expo is "Better City, Better Life."

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Sustainability.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
And we thought, sustainability has grown into being

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
this sort of neo-Protestant idea

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
that it has to hurt in order to do good.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
You know, you're not supposed to take long, warm showers.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
You're not supposed to fly on holidays because it's bad for the environment.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Gradually, you get this idea that sustainable life

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
is less fun than normal life.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
So we thought that maybe it could be interesting to focus on examples

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
where a sustainable city

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
actually increases the quality of life.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
We also asked ourselves, what could Denmark possibly show China

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
that would be relevant?

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
You know, it's one of the biggest countries in the world, one of the smallest.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
China symbolized by the dragon.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Denmark, we have a national bird, the swan.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
(Laughter)

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
China has many great poets,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
but we discovered that in the People's Republic

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
public school curriculum,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
they have three fairy tales by An Tu Sheng,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
or Hans Christian Anderson, as we call him.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
So that means that all 1.3 billion Chinese

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
have grown up with "The Emperor's New Clothes,"

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
"The Matchstick Girl" and "The Little Mermaid."

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
It's almost like a fragment of Danish culture

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
integrated into Chinese culture.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
The biggest tourist attraction in China is the Great Wall.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
The Great Wall is the only thing that can be seen from the moon.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
The big tourist attraction in Denmark is The Little Mermaid.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
That can actually hardly be seen from the canal tours.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
(Laughter)

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And it sort of shows the difference between these two cities.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Copenhagen, Shanghai,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
modern, European.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
But then we looked at recent urban development,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
and we noticed that this is like a Shanghai street,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
30 years ago. All bikes, no cars.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
This is how it looks today; all traffic jam.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Bicycles have become forbidden many places.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Meanwhile, in Copenhagen we're actually expanding the bicycle lanes.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
A third of all the people commute by bike.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
We have a free system of bicycles called the City Bike

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
that you can borrow if you visit the city.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
So we thought, why don't we reintroduce the bicycle in China?

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
We donate 1,000 bikes to Shanghai.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
So if you come to the expo, go straight to the Danish pavilion,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
get a Danish bike, and then continue on that to visit the other pavilions.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Like I said, Shanghai and Copenhagen are both port cities,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
but in Copenhagen the water has gotten so clean

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
that you can actually swim in it.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
One of the first projects we ever did

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
was the harbor bath in Copenhagen,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
sort of continuing the public realm into the water.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
So we thought that these expos quite often have a lot of

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
state financed propaganda,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
images, statements, but no real experience.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
So just like with a bike, we don't talk about it.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
You can try it.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Like with the water, instead of talking about it,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
we're going to sail a million liters of harbor water

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
from Copenhagen to Shanghai,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
so the Chinese who have the courage can actually dive in

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
and feel how clean it is.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
This is where people normally object that it doesn't sound very sustainable

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
to sail water from Copenhagen to China.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
But in fact, the container ships go

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
full of goods from China to Denmark,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
and then they sail empty back.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
So quite often you load water for ballast.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
So we can actually hitch a ride for free.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
And in the middle of this sort of harbor bath,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
we're actually going to put the actual Little Mermaid.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
So the real Mermaid, the real water, and the real bikes.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
And when she's gone, we're going to invite

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
a Chinese artist to reinterpret her.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
The architecture of the pavilion is this sort of loop

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
of exhibition and bikes.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
When you go to the exhibition, you'll see the Mermaid and the pool.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
You'll walk around, start looking for a bicycle on the roof,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000
jump on your ride and then continue out into the rest of the expo.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
So when we actually won the competition

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
we had to do an exhibition in China explaining the project.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
And to our surprise we got one of our boards back

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000
with corrections from the Chinese state censorship.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
The first thing, the China map missed Taiwan.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
It's a very serious political issue in China. We will add on.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
The second thing, we had compared the swan to the dragon,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
and then the Chinese state said,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
"Suggest change to panda."

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
(Laughter)

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
(Applause)

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
So, when it came out in Denmark that we were actually going to

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
move our national monument,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
the National People's Party sort of rebelled against it.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
They tried to pass a law against moving the Mermaid.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
So for the first time, I got invited to speak at the National Parliament.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
It was kind of interesting because in the morning, from 9 to 11,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
they were discussing the bailout package --

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
how many billions to invest in saving the Danish economy.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
And then at 11 o'clock they stopped talking about these little issues.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
And then from 11 to 1,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
they were debating whether or not to send the Mermaid to China.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
(Laughter)

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
(Applause)

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
But to conclude, if you want to see the Mermaid from May to December

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
next year, don't come to Copenhagen,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
because she's going to be in Shanghai.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
If you do come to Copenhagen,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
you will probably see an installation by Ai Weiwei, the Chinese artist.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
But if the Chinese government intervenes, it might even be a panda.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
(Laughter)

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
So the second story that I'd like to tell

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
is, actually starts in my own house.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
This is my apartment.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
This is the view from my apartment,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
over the sort of landscape of triangular balconies

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
that our client called the Leonardo DiCaprio balcony.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:57.000
And they form this sort of vertical backyard

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
where, on a nice summer day, you'll actually get introduced to all your neighbors

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
in a vertical radius of 10 meters.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
The house is sort of a distortion of a square block.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Trying to zigzag it to make sure

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
that all of the apartments look at the straight views,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
instead of into each other.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Until recently, this was the view from my apartment,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
onto this place where our client actually bought the neighbor site.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
And he said that he was going to do an apartment block

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
next to a parking structure.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
And we thought, rather than doing a traditional stack of apartments

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
looking straight into a big boring block of cars,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
why don't we turn all the apartments into penthouses,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
put them on a podium of cars.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
And because Copenhagen is completely flat,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
if you want to have a nice south-facing slope with a view,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
you basically have to do it yourself.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Then we sort of cut up the volume,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
so we wouldn't block the view from my apartment.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
(Laughter)

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
And essentially the parking is sort of occupying the deep space

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
underneath the apartments.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
And up in the sun, you have a single layer of apartments

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
that combine all the splendors of a suburban lifestyle,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
like a house with a garden with a sort of metropolitan view,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
and a sort of dense urban location.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
This is our first architectural model.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
This is an aerial photo taken last summer.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
And essentially, the apartments cover the parking.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
They are accessed through this diagonal elevator.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
It's actually a stand-up product from Switzerland,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
because in Switzerland they have a natural need for diagonal elevators.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
(Laughter)

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
And the facade of the parking,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
we wanted to make the parking naturally ventilated,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
so we needed to perforate it.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
And we discovered that by controlling the size of the holes,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
we could actually turn the entire facade

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
into a gigantic, naturally ventilated,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
rasterized image.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
And since we always refer to the project as The Mountain,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
we commissioned this Japanese Himalaya photographer

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
to give us this beautiful photo of Mount Everest,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
making the entire building a 3,000 square meter artwork.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:00.000
(Applause)

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
So if you go back into the parking, into the corridors,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
it's almost like traveling into a parallel universe

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
from cars and colors,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
into this sort of south-facing urban oasis.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
The wood of your apartment continues outside becoming the facades.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
If you go even further, it turns into this green garden.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
And all the rainwater that drops on the Mountain

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
is actually accumulated.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
And there is an automatic irrigation system

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
that makes sure that this sort of landscape of gardens,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
in one or two years it will sort of transform

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
into a Cambodian temple ruin,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
completely covered in green.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
So, the Mountain is like our first built example

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
of what we like to refer to as architectural alchemy.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
This idea that you can actually create, if not gold,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
then at least added value by mixing

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
traditional ingredients, like normal apartments

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
and normal parking,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
and in this case actually offer people

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
the chance that they don't have to choose between

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
a life with a garden or a life in the city.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
They can actually have both.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
As an architect, it's really hard to set the agenda.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
You can't just say that now I'd like to do a sustainable city

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
in central Asia,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
because that's not really how you get commissions.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
You always have to sort of adapt and improvise

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
to the opportunities and accidents that happen,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
and the sort of turmoil of the world.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
One last example is that recently we,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
like last summer, we won the competition

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
to design a Nordic national bank.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
This was the director of the bank when he was still smiling.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
(Laughter)

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
It was in the middle of the capital so we were really excited by this opportunity.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Unfortunately, it was the national bank of Iceland.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
At the same time, we actually had a visitor --

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
a minister from Azerbaijan came to our office.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
We took him to see the Mountain. And he got very excited

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
by this idea that you could actually make mountains

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
out of architecture,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
because Azerbaijan is known as the Alps of Central Asia.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
So he asked us if we could actually imagine

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
an urban master plan

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
on an island outside the capital

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
that would recreate the silhouette of the seven most significant mountains

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
of Azerbaijan.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
So we took the commission.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
And we made this small movie that I'd like to show.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
We quite often make little movies.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
We always argue a lot about the soundtrack,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
but in this case it was really easy to choose the song.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
So basically, Baku is this sort of crescent bay

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
overlooking the island of Zira, the island that we are planning --

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
almost like the diagram of their flag.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
And our main idea was

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
to sort of sample the seven most significant mountains

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
of the topography of Azerbaijan

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
and reinterpret them into urban and architectural structures,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
inhabitable of human life.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Then we place these mountains on the island,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
surrounding this sort of central green valley,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
almost like a central park.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
And what makes it interesting is that the island right now

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
is just a piece of desert. It has no vegetation.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
It has no water. It has no energy, no resources.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
So we actually sort of designed the entire island as a single ecosystem,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
exploiting wind energy to drive the desalination plants,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
and to use the thermal properties of water

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
to heat and cool the buildings.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
And all the sort of excess freshwater wastewater

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
is filtered organically into the landscape,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
gradually transforming the desert island

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
into sort of a green, lush landscape.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
So, you can say where an urban development

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
normally happens at the expense of nature,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
in this case it's actually creating nature.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
And the buildings, they don't only sort of

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
invoke the imagery of the mountains,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
they also operate like mountains.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
They create shelter from the wind.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
They accumulate the solar energy.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
They accumulate the water.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
So they actually transform the entire island

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
into a single ecosystem.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
So we recently presented the master plan,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
and it has gotten approved.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
And this summer we are starting the construction documents

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
of the two first mountains,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
in what's going to be the first carbon-neutral island

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
in Central Asia.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:25.000
(Applause)

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
Yes, maybe just to round off.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
So in a way you can see how the Mountain in Copenhagen

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
sort of evolved into the Seven Peaks of Azerbaijan.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
With a little luck and some more evolution,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
maybe in 10 years it could be the Five Mountains on Mars.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
Thank you.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:53.000
(Applause)
