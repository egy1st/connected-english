00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So the question is, what is invisible?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
There is more of it than you think, actually.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Everything, I would say. Everything that matters

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
except every thing and except matter.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We can see matter. But we can't see what's the matter.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
As in this cryptic sentence I found in The Guardian recently:

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
"The marriage suffered a setback in 1965,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
when the husband was killed by the wife."

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
(Laughter)

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
There's a world of invisibility there, isn't there?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
(Laughter)

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So, we can see the stars and the planets,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
but we can't see what holds them apart

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
or what draws them together.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
With matter, as with people, we see only the skin of things.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We can't see into the engine room.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
We can't see what makes people tick, at least not without difficulty.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And the closer we look at anything, the more it disappears.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
In fact, if you look really closely at stuff,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
if you look at the basic substructure of matter,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
there isn't anything there.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Electrons disappear in a kind of fuzz,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and there is only energy. And you can't see energy.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So everything that matters, that's important, is invisible.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
One slightly silly thing that's invisible

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
is this story, which is invisible to you.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And I'm now going to make it visible to you in your minds.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
It's about an M.P. called Geoffrey Dickens.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
The late Geoffrey Dickens, M.P. was attending a fete in his constituency.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Wherever he went, at every stall he stopped he was closely followed

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
by a devoted smiling woman of indescribable ugliness.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
(Laughter)

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Try as he might, he couldn't get away from her.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
A few days later he received a letter from a constituent

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
saying how much she admired him,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
had met him at a fete and asking for a signed photograph.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
After her name, written in brackets was the apt description, horse face.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
(Laughter)

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
"I've misjudged this women," thought Mr. Dickens.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
"Not only is she aware of her physical repulsiveness,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
she turns it to her advantage.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
A photo is not enough."

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
So he went out and bought a plastic frame to put the photograph in.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And on the photograph, he wrote with a flourish,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
"To Horse Face, with love from Geoffrey Dickens, M.P."

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
After it had been sent off, his secretary said to him,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
"Did you get that letter from the woman at the fete?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I wrote Horse Face on her, so you'd remember who she was."

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
(Laughter)

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I bet he thought he wished he was invisible, don't you?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
(Laughter)

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
So, one of the interesting things about invisibility

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
is that things that we can't see

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
we also can't understand.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Gravity is one thing that we can't see

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and which we don't understand.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
It's the least understood of all the four fundamental forces,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and the weakest.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
And nobody really knows what it is or why it's there.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
For what it's worth, Sir Isaac Newton, the greatest scientist who ever lived,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
he thought Jesus came to Earth specifically to operate the levers of gravity.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
That's what he thought he was there for.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
So, bright guy, could be wrong on that one, I don't know.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
(Laughter)

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Consciousness. I see all your faces.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
I have no idea what any of you are thinking. Isn't that amazing?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Isn't that incredible that we can't read each other's minds?

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
But we can touch each other, taste each other perhaps, if we get close enough.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
But we can't read each other's minds. I find that quite astonishing.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
In the Sufi faith, this great Middle Eastern religion,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
which some claim is the route of all religions,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Sufi masters are all telepaths, so they say.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
But their main exercise of telepathy

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
is to send out powerful signals to the rest of us that it doesn't exist.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
So that's why we don't think it exists,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
the Sufi masters working on us.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
In the question of consciousness

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and artificial intelligence,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
artificial intelligence has really, like the study of consciousness,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
gotten nowhere. We have no idea how consciousness works.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
With artificial intelligence, not only have they not created artificial intelligence,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
they haven't yet created artificial stupidity.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
(Laughter)

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
The laws of physics: invisible, eternal, omnipresent, all-powerful.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Remind you of anyone?

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Interesting. I'm, as you can guess,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
not a materialist, I'm an immaterialist.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And I've found a very useful new word, ignostic. Okay?

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
I'm an ignostic.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
I refuse to be drawn on the question of whether God exists,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
until somebody properly defines the terms.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
(Laughter)

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Another thing we can't see is the human genome.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
And this is increasingly peculiar,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
because about 20 years ago, when they started delving into the genome,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
they thought it would probably contain around 100,000 genes.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Geneticists will know this, but every year since,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
it's been revised downwards.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
We now think there are likely to be only just over 20,000

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
genes in the human genome.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
This is extraordinary. Because rice -- get this --

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
rice is known to have 38 thousand genes.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Potatoes, potatoes have 48 chromosomes. Do you know that?

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Two more than people,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
and the same as a gorilla.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
(Laughter)

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
You can't see these things, but they are very strange.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
(Laughter)

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
The stars by day. I always think that's fascinating.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
The universe disappears.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
The more light there is, the less you can see.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Time, nobody can see time.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
I don't know if you know this. Modern physics,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
there is a big movement in modern physics

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
to decide that time doesn't really exist,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
because it's too inconvenient for the figures.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
It's much easier if it's not really there.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
You can't see the future, obviously.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And you can't see the past, except in your memory.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
One of the interesting things about the past is

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
you particularly can't see. My son asked me this the other day,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
he said, "Dad, can you remember what I was like when I was two?"

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And I said, "Yes." And he said, "Why can't I?"

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Isn't that extraordinary? You cannot remember

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
what happened to you earlier than the age of two or three,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
which is great news for psychoanalysts,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
because otherwise they'd be out of a job.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Because that's where all the stuff happens

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
(Laughter)

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
that makes you who you are.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Another thing you can't see is the grid on which we hang.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
This is fascinating. You probably know, some of you,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
that cells are continually renewed. You can see it in skin and this kind of stuff.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Skin flakes off, hairs grow, nails, that kind of stuff.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
But every cell in your body is replaced at some point.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Taste buds, every 10 days or so.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Livers and internal organs sort of take a bit longer. A spine takes several years.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
But at the end of seven years, not one cell in your body

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
remains from what was there seven years ago.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
The question is, who, then, are we?

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
What are we? What is this thing that we hang on,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
that is actually us?

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Okay. Atoms, you can't see them.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Nobody ever will. They're smaller than the wavelength of light.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Gas, you can't see that.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Interesting. Somebody mentioned 1600 recently.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Gas was invented in 1600

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
by a Dutch chemist called Van Helmont.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
It's said to be the most successful ever invention

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
of a word by a known individual.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Quite good. He also invented a word called "blas,"

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
meaning astral radiation.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Didn't catch on, unfortunately.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
(Laughter)

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
But well done, him.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000
(Laughter)

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
There is so many things that -- Light.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
You can't see light. When it's dark, in a vacuum,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
if a person shines a beam of light straight across your eyes,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
you won't see it. Slightly technical, some physicists will disagree with this.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
But it's odd that you can't see the beam of light,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
you can only see what it hits.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
I find that extraordinary, not to be able to see light,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
not to be able to see darkness.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Electricity, you can't see that.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Don't let anyone tell you they understand electricity.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
They don't. Nobody knows what it is.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000
(Laughter)

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
You probably think the electrons in an electric wire

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
move instantaneously down a wire, don't you, at the speed of light

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
when you turn the light on. They don't.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Electrons bumble down the wire,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
about the speed of spreading honey, they say.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
(Laughter)

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Galaxies, 100 billion of them estimated in the universe.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
100 billion. How many can we see? Five.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Five out of the 100 billion galaxies, with the naked eye,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
and one of them is quite difficult to see unless you've got very good eyesight.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Radio waves. There's another thing.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Heinrich Hertz, when he discovered radio waves in 1887,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
he called them radio waves because they radiated.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
And somebody said to him,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
"Well what's the point of these, Heinrich?

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
What's the point of these radio waves that you've found?"

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And he said, "Well, I've no idea.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
But I guess somebody will find a use for them someday."

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
And that's what they do, radio. That's what they discovered.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Anyway, so the biggest thing

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
that's invisible to us is what we don't know.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
It is incredible how little we know.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Thomas Edison once said,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
"We don't know one percent of one millionth

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
about anything."

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
And I've come to the conclusion --

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
because you've asked this other question, "What's another thing you can't see?"

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
The point, most of us. What's the point?

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
(Laughter)

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000
(Applause)

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
You can't see a point. It's by definition dimensionless,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
like an electron, oddly enough.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
But the point, what I've got it down to,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
is there are only two questions really worth asking.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
"Why are we here?" and "What should we do about it while we are?

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
And to help you, I've got two things to leave you with, from two great philosophers,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
perhaps two of the greatest philosopher thinkers of the 20th century,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
one a mathematician and an engineer, and the other a poet.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
The first is Ludwig Wittgenstein who said,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
"I don't know why we are here.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
But I'm pretty sure it's not in order to enjoy ourselves."

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:38.000
(Laughter)

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
He was a cheerful bastard wasn't he?

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
(Laughter)

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
And secondly and lastly, W.H. Auden,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
one of my favorite poets, who said,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
"We are here on earth

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
to help others.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
What the others are here for, I've no idea."

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
(Laughter)

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:04.000
(Applause)
