WEBVTT

00:00:00.825 --> 00:00:02.785
We see with the eyes,

00:00:02.809 --> 00:00:05.254
but we see with the brain as well.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.839
And seeing with the brain
is often called imagination.

00:00:10.982 --> 00:00:15.165
And we are familiar with the landscapes
of our own imagination,

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:16.559
our inscapes.

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:18.583
We've lived with them all our lives.

00:00:19.306 --> 00:00:22.799
But there are also hallucinations as well.

00:00:23.332 --> 00:00:25.976
And hallucinations
are completely different.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.110
They don't seem to be of our creation.

00:00:28.134 --> 00:00:30.174
They don't seem to be under control.

00:00:30.198 --> 00:00:34.488
They seem to come from the outside
and to mimic perception.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.031
So I am going to be talking
about hallucinations

00:00:39.055 --> 00:00:42.166
and a particular sort
of visual hallucination,

00:00:43.658 --> 00:00:46.705
which I see among my patients.

00:00:48.594 --> 00:00:54.006
A few months ago, I got a phone call
from a nursing home where I work.

00:00:54.496 --> 00:00:59.229
They told me that one of their residents,
an old lady in her 90s,

00:00:59.253 --> 00:01:00.743
was seeing things,

00:01:01.602 --> 00:01:04.288
and they wondered if she'd gone bonkers

00:01:04.312 --> 00:01:05.858
or, because she was an old lady,

00:01:05.882 --> 00:01:09.170
whether she'd had a stroke,
or whether she had Alzheimer's.

00:01:09.194 --> 00:01:13.375
And so they asked me
if I would come and see Rosalie,

00:01:14.478 --> 00:01:15.700
the old lady.

00:01:16.327 --> 00:01:17.976
I went in to see her.

00:01:18.358 --> 00:01:22.948
It was evident straightaway
that she was perfectly sane

00:01:22.972 --> 00:01:26.764
and lucid and of good intelligence,

00:01:26.788 --> 00:01:30.153
but she'd been very startled
and very bewildered,

00:01:30.177 --> 00:01:32.187
because she'd been seeing things.

00:01:33.672 --> 00:01:37.976
And she told me --
the nurses hadn't mentioned this --

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.276
that she was blind,

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.121
that she had been completely blind
from macular degeneration for five years.

00:01:45.145 --> 00:01:48.695
But now, for the last few days,
she'd been seeing things.

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:50.716
So I said, "What sort of things?"

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.457
And she said, "People in Eastern dress,

00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:57.475
in drapes, walking up and down stairs.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.449
A man who turns towards me and smiles,

00:02:01.473 --> 00:02:04.812
but he has huge teeth
on one side of his mouth.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.845
Animals too.

00:02:07.597 --> 00:02:10.605
I see a white building.
It's snowing, a soft snow.

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:14.614
I see this horse with a harness,
dragging the snow away.

00:02:15.527 --> 00:02:18.802
Then, one night, the scene changes.

00:02:18.826 --> 00:02:21.380
I see cats and dogs walking towards me.

00:02:21.404 --> 00:02:24.038
They come to a certain point
and then stop.

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.133
Then it changes again.

00:02:26.157 --> 00:02:29.279
I see a lot of children.
They're walking up and down stairs.

00:02:29.303 --> 00:02:32.240
They wear bright colors, rose and blue,

00:02:32.264 --> 00:02:33.854
like Eastern dress."

00:02:34.857 --> 00:02:38.434
Sometimes, she said,
before the people come on,

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:41.976
she may hallucinate
pink and blue squares on the floor,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.888
which seem to go up to the ceiling.

00:02:44.856 --> 00:02:49.454
I said, "Is this like a dream?"

00:02:49.478 --> 00:02:52.837
And she said, "No, it's not
like a dream. It's like a movie."

00:02:52.861 --> 00:02:55.500
She said, "It's got color.
It's got motion.

00:02:55.524 --> 00:02:58.976
But it's completely silent,
like a silent movie."

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.254
And she said it's a rather boring movie.

00:03:01.278 --> 00:03:02.279
(Laughter)

00:03:02.303 --> 00:03:04.508
She said, "All these people
with Eastern dress,

00:03:04.532 --> 00:03:08.526
walking up and down,
very repetitive, very limited."

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:09.952
(Laughter)

00:03:09.976 --> 00:03:12.747
And she had a sense of humor.

00:03:12.771 --> 00:03:16.073
She knew it was a hallucination,
but she was frightened.

00:03:16.097 --> 00:03:17.461
She had lived 95 years,

00:03:17.485 --> 00:03:19.762
and she'd never had
a hallucination before.

00:03:20.247 --> 00:03:25.303
She said that the hallucinations were
unrelated to anything she was thinking

00:03:25.327 --> 00:03:27.921
or feeling or doing,

00:03:27.945 --> 00:03:31.712
that they seemed to come on
by themselves, or disappear.

00:03:31.736 --> 00:03:33.936
She had no control over them.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.478
She said she didn't recognize
any of the people or places

00:03:37.502 --> 00:03:39.248
in the hallucinations,

00:03:39.272 --> 00:03:41.521
and none of the people or the animals --

00:03:41.545 --> 00:03:44.350
well, they all seemed oblivious of her.

00:03:45.223 --> 00:03:47.240
And she didn't know what was going on.

00:03:47.264 --> 00:03:51.196
She wondered if she was going mad
or losing her mind.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.729
Well, I examined her carefully.

00:03:53.753 --> 00:03:56.142
She was a bright old lady,

00:03:56.166 --> 00:03:57.507
perfectly sane.

00:03:57.531 --> 00:03:59.441
She had no medical problems.

00:03:59.465 --> 00:04:03.061
She wasn't on any medications
which could produce hallucinations.

00:04:03.085 --> 00:04:04.566
But she was blind.

00:04:05.657 --> 00:04:09.460
And I then said to her,
"I think I know what you have."

00:04:09.484 --> 00:04:13.101
I said, "There is a special form
of visual hallucination

00:04:13.125 --> 00:04:17.077
which may go with deteriorating
vision or blindness.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.857
This was originally described," I said,

00:04:19.881 --> 00:04:22.103
"right back in the 18th century,

00:04:22.127 --> 00:04:25.082
by a man called Charles Bonnet.

00:04:25.106 --> 00:04:27.953
And you have Charles Bonnet syndrome.

00:04:27.977 --> 00:04:31.637
There's nothing wrong with your brain.
There's nothing wrong with your mind.

00:04:31.661 --> 00:04:33.493
You have Charles Bonnet syndrome."

00:04:33.517 --> 00:04:36.342
And she was very relieved at this,

00:04:36.366 --> 00:04:39.112
that there was nothing
seriously the matter,

00:04:39.136 --> 00:04:42.603
and also rather curious.

00:04:42.627 --> 00:04:45.610
She said, "Who is this Charles Bonnet?"

00:04:45.634 --> 00:04:47.607
She said, "Did he have them himself?"

00:04:48.107 --> 00:04:53.579
And she said, "Tell all the nurses
that I have Charles Bonnet syndrome."

00:04:53.603 --> 00:04:55.103
(Laughter)

00:04:55.127 --> 00:04:59.164
"I'm not crazy. I'm not demented.
I have Charles Bonnet syndrome."

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.101
Well, so, I did tell the nurses.

00:05:02.125 --> 00:05:04.976
Now this, for me, is a common situation.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.746
I work in old-age homes, largely.

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.937
I see a lot of elderly people

00:05:09.961 --> 00:05:12.918
who are hearing-impaired
or visually impaired.

00:05:12.942 --> 00:05:15.594
About 10 percent
of the hearing-impaired people

00:05:15.618 --> 00:05:18.188
get musical hallucinations.

00:05:18.212 --> 00:05:21.193
And about 10 percent
of the visually impaired people

00:05:21.217 --> 00:05:23.114
get visual hallucinations.

00:05:23.138 --> 00:05:25.399
You don't have to be completely blind,

00:05:25.423 --> 00:05:27.693
only sufficiently impaired.

00:05:27.717 --> 00:05:31.604
Now, with the original description
in the 18th century,

00:05:31.628 --> 00:05:33.443
Charles Bonnet did not have them.

00:05:33.467 --> 00:05:36.209
His grandfather had these hallucinations.

00:05:36.233 --> 00:05:39.573
His grandfather was
a magistrate, an elderly man.

00:05:39.597 --> 00:05:41.830
He'd had cataract surgery.

00:05:41.854 --> 00:05:44.105
His vision was pretty poor.

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:49.294
And in 1759, he described to his grandson

00:05:49.318 --> 00:05:51.635
various things he was seeing.

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:55.107
The first thing he said
was he saw a handkerchief in midair.

00:05:55.131 --> 00:05:58.976
It was a large blue handkerchief
with four orange circles.

00:05:59.456 --> 00:06:01.827
And he knew it was a hallucination.

00:06:01.851 --> 00:06:04.214
You don't have handkerchiefs in midair.

00:06:04.238 --> 00:06:07.525
And then he saw a big wheel in midair.

00:06:08.327 --> 00:06:13.277
But sometimes he wasn't sure
whether he was hallucinating or not,

00:06:13.301 --> 00:06:16.976
because the hallucinations would fit
in the context of the visions.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.821
So on one occasion, when
his granddaughters were visiting them,

00:06:20.845 --> 00:06:23.988
he said, "And who are these
handsome young men with you?"

00:06:24.012 --> 00:06:25.027
(Laughter)

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:29.685
And they said, "Alas, Grandpapa,
there are no handsome young men."

00:06:29.709 --> 00:06:32.102
And then the handsome
young men disappeared.

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:35.976
It's typical of these hallucinations

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.976
that they may come in a flash
and disappear in a flash.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.568
They don't usually fade in and out.

00:06:41.592 --> 00:06:44.935
They are rather sudden,
and they change suddenly.

00:06:44.959 --> 00:06:46.976
Charles Lullin, the grandfather,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.976
saw hundreds of different figures,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.611
different landscapes of all sorts.

00:06:52.635 --> 00:06:56.448
On one occasion, he saw a man
in a bathrobe smoking a pipe,

00:06:56.472 --> 00:06:58.544
and realized it was himself.

00:06:59.306 --> 00:07:01.976
That was the only figure he recognized.

00:07:02.694 --> 00:07:05.976
On one occasion, when he was walking
in the streets of Paris,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.039
he saw -- this was real -- a scaffolding.

00:07:09.063 --> 00:07:12.577
But when he got back home,
he saw a miniature of the scaffolding,

00:07:12.601 --> 00:07:14.327
six inches high,

00:07:14.351 --> 00:07:16.119
on his study table.

00:07:16.143 --> 00:07:20.975
This repetition of perception
is sometimes called "palinopsia."

00:07:22.445 --> 00:07:26.372
With him and with Rosalie,

00:07:26.396 --> 00:07:27.976
what seems to be going on --

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.148
and Rosalie said, "What's going on?" --

00:07:30.172 --> 00:07:32.976
and I said that as you lose vision,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.048
as the visual parts of the brain
are no longer getting any input,

00:07:36.072 --> 00:07:39.154
they become hyperactive and excitable,

00:07:39.178 --> 00:07:41.879
and they start to fire spontaneously.

00:07:41.903 --> 00:07:44.053
And you start to see things.

00:07:44.077 --> 00:07:48.607
The things you see
can be very complicated indeed.

00:07:48.631 --> 00:07:53.681
With another patient of mine
who also had some vision,

00:07:54.829 --> 00:07:57.365
the visions she had could be disturbing.

00:07:57.389 --> 00:08:02.976
On one occasion, she said she saw
a man in a striped shirt in a restaurant.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.296
And he turned round,

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:08.423
and then he divided
into six figures in striped shirts,

00:08:08.447 --> 00:08:10.857
who started walking towards her.

00:08:10.881 --> 00:08:14.290
And then the six figures came
together, like a concertina.

00:08:14.314 --> 00:08:16.036
Once, when she was driving,

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:17.976
or rather, her husband was driving,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.292
the road divided into four

00:08:20.316 --> 00:08:24.192
and she felt herself going
simultaneously up four roads.

00:08:24.859 --> 00:08:29.650
She had very mobile
hallucinations as well.

00:08:29.674 --> 00:08:31.844
A lot of them had to do with a car.

00:08:31.868 --> 00:08:36.698
Sometimes she would see a teenage boy
sitting on the hood of the car.

00:08:36.722 --> 00:08:38.219
He was very tenacious,

00:08:38.243 --> 00:08:41.543
and he moved rather gracefully
when the car turned.

00:08:41.567 --> 00:08:43.976
And then when they came to a stop,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.537
the boy would do a sudden vertical
takeoff, 100 foot in the air,

00:08:47.561 --> 00:08:48.973
and then disappear.

00:08:50.377 --> 00:08:54.976
Another patient of mine
had a different sort of hallucination.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.887
This was a woman
who didn't have trouble with her eyes

00:08:57.911 --> 00:08:59.976
but the visual parts of her brain,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.658
a little tumor in the occipital cortex.

00:09:03.682 --> 00:09:07.463
And, above all, she would see cartoons.

00:09:08.288 --> 00:09:12.795
And these cartoons would be transparent,

00:09:12.819 --> 00:09:16.782
and would cover half
the visual field, like a screen.

00:09:16.806 --> 00:09:21.585
And especially, she saw
cartoons of Kermit the Frog.

00:09:21.609 --> 00:09:23.061
(Laughter)

00:09:23.085 --> 00:09:27.791
Now, I don't watch Sesame Street,

00:09:27.815 --> 00:09:29.586
but she made a point of saying,

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:32.976
"Why Kermit?" she said,
"Kermit the Frog means nothing to me."

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.111
You know, I was wondering about
Freudian determinants: Why Kermit?

00:09:38.135 --> 00:09:40.500
"Kermit the Frog means nothing to me."

00:09:40.524 --> 00:09:42.706
She didn't mind the cartoons too much.

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:44.318
But what did disturb her

00:09:44.342 --> 00:09:48.912
was she got very persistent images
or hallucinations of faces,

00:09:48.936 --> 00:09:52.423
and as with Rosalie,
the faces were often deformed,

00:09:52.447 --> 00:09:55.585
with very large teeth or very large eyes.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.254
And these frightened her.

00:09:59.262 --> 00:10:03.040
Well, what is going on with these people?

00:10:03.064 --> 00:10:06.678
As a physician, I have to try
and define what's going on

00:10:06.702 --> 00:10:08.408
and to reassure people,

00:10:08.432 --> 00:10:11.976
especially to reassure them
that they're not going insane.

00:10:13.019 --> 00:10:15.244
Something like 10 percent, as I said,

00:10:15.268 --> 00:10:18.221
of visually impaired people get these.

00:10:18.245 --> 00:10:21.976
But no more than one percent
of the people acknowledge them,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.356
because they are afraid
they will be seen as insane or something.

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:27.828
And if they do mention them
to their own doctors,

00:10:27.852 --> 00:10:29.707
they may be misdiagnosed.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:33.596
In particular, the notion
is that if you see things or hear things,

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:34.846
you're going mad.

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:37.895
But the psychotic hallucinations
are quite different.

00:10:37.919 --> 00:10:41.118
Psychotic hallucinations,
whether they are visual or vocal,

00:10:41.142 --> 00:10:42.318
they address you.

00:10:42.342 --> 00:10:47.052
They accuse you, they seduce you,
they humiliate you, they jeer at you.

00:10:48.072 --> 00:10:49.657
You interact with them.

00:10:50.643 --> 00:10:53.614
There is none of this quality
of being addressed

00:10:53.638 --> 00:10:56.099
with these Charles Bonnet hallucinations.

00:10:56.123 --> 00:11:00.726
There is a film. You're seeing a film
which has nothing to do with you --

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:03.292
or that's how people think about it.

00:11:03.728 --> 00:11:07.537
There is also a rare thing
called temporal lobe epilepsy,

00:11:07.561 --> 00:11:09.976
and sometimes, if one has this,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.025
one may feel oneself transported
back to a time and place in the past.

00:11:15.049 --> 00:11:17.518
You're at a particular road junction.

00:11:17.542 --> 00:11:19.569
You smell chestnuts roasting.

00:11:19.593 --> 00:11:22.839
You hear the traffic.
All the senses are involved.

00:11:22.863 --> 00:11:24.573
And you're waiting for your girl.

00:11:24.597 --> 00:11:28.786
And it's that Tuesday
evening back in 1982.

00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:32.708
The temporal lobe hallucinations
are all sense hallucinations,

00:11:32.732 --> 00:11:35.269
full of feeling, full of familiarity,

00:11:35.293 --> 00:11:37.360
located in space and time,

00:11:37.384 --> 00:11:39.088
coherent, dramatic.

00:11:39.722 --> 00:11:41.976
The Charles Bonnet
ones are quite different.

00:11:42.516 --> 00:11:47.847
In the Charles Bonnet hallucinations,
you have all sorts of levels,

00:11:47.871 --> 00:11:49.976
from the geometrical hallucinations --

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.264
the pink and blue squares the woman had --

00:11:53.288 --> 00:11:57.735
up to quite elaborate hallucinations

00:11:57.759 --> 00:12:00.440
with figures and especially faces.

00:12:00.464 --> 00:12:03.576
Faces, and sometimes deformed faces,

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:08.038
are the single commonest thing
in these hallucinations.

00:12:08.062 --> 00:12:10.976
And one of the second
commonest is cartoons.

00:12:11.404 --> 00:12:14.240
So, what is going on?

00:12:14.264 --> 00:12:16.255
Fascinatingly, in the last few years,

00:12:16.279 --> 00:12:20.198
it's been possible to do
functional brain imagery,

00:12:20.222 --> 00:12:24.975
to do fMRI on people
as they are hallucinating,

00:12:24.999 --> 00:12:31.164
and, in fact, to find that different parts
of the visual brain are activated

00:12:31.188 --> 00:12:33.024
as they are hallucinating.

00:12:33.048 --> 00:12:36.398
When people have these simple,
geometrical hallucinations,

00:12:36.422 --> 00:12:39.976
the primary visual cortex is activated.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.736
This is the part of the brain
which perceives edges and patterns.

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:47.768
You don't form images
with your primary visual cortex.

00:12:47.792 --> 00:12:50.114
When images are formed,

00:12:50.138 --> 00:12:55.725
a higher part of the visual cortex
is involved, in the temporal lobe.

00:12:55.749 --> 00:12:58.818
And in particular,
one area of the temporal lobe

00:12:58.842 --> 00:13:01.691
is called the fusiform gyrus.

00:13:01.715 --> 00:13:05.362
And it's known that if people
have damage in the fusiform gyrus,

00:13:05.386 --> 00:13:08.795
they may lose the ability
to recognize faces.

00:13:09.533 --> 00:13:13.105
But if there's an abnormal activity
in the fusiform gyrus,

00:13:13.129 --> 00:13:15.287
they may hallucinate faces,

00:13:15.311 --> 00:13:18.513
and this is exactly what you find
in some of these people.

00:13:18.537 --> 00:13:22.720
There is an area
in the anterior part of this gyrus

00:13:22.744 --> 00:13:26.976
where teeth and eyes are represented,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.612
and that part of the gyrus is activated

00:13:30.636 --> 00:13:34.405
when people get
the deformed hallucinations.

00:13:34.429 --> 00:13:38.226
There is another part of the brain
which is especially activated

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:40.226
when one sees cartoons.

00:13:40.713 --> 00:13:43.598
It's activated
when one recognizes cartoons,

00:13:43.622 --> 00:13:46.852
when one draws cartoons
and when one hallucinates them.

00:13:46.876 --> 00:13:50.132
It's very interesting
that that should be specific.

00:13:50.156 --> 00:13:53.284
There are other parts of the brain
which are specifically involved

00:13:53.308 --> 00:13:57.795
with the recognition and hallucination
of buildings and landscapes.

00:13:57.819 --> 00:14:01.757
Around 1970, it was found that there were
not only parts of the brain,

00:14:01.781 --> 00:14:03.661
but particular cells.

00:14:03.685 --> 00:14:07.869
"Face cells" were discovered around 1970.

00:14:07.893 --> 00:14:11.979
And now we know that there are
hundreds of other sorts of cells,

00:14:12.003 --> 00:14:14.257
which can be very, very specific.

00:14:14.281 --> 00:14:21.253
So you may not only have "car" cells,
you may have "Aston Martin" cells.

00:14:21.277 --> 00:14:23.551
(Laughter)

00:14:23.575 --> 00:14:26.797
I saw an Aston Martin this morning.
I had to bring it in.

00:14:26.821 --> 00:14:27.844
(Laughter)

00:14:27.868 --> 00:14:30.684
And now it's in there, somewhere.

00:14:30.708 --> 00:14:31.866
So --

00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:33.354
(Laughter)

00:14:33.378 --> 00:14:38.107
now, at this level, in what's called
the inferotemporal cortex,

00:14:38.131 --> 00:14:40.417
there are only visual images,

00:14:40.441 --> 00:14:43.013
or figments or fragments.

00:14:43.037 --> 00:14:48.074
It's only at higher levels
that the other senses join in

00:14:48.098 --> 00:14:51.023
and there are connections
with memory and emotion.

00:14:51.047 --> 00:14:52.748
And in the Charles Bonnet syndrome,

00:14:52.772 --> 00:14:54.987
you don't go to those higher levels.

00:14:55.011 --> 00:14:58.022
You're in these levels
of inferior visual cortex,

00:14:58.046 --> 00:15:00.722
where you have thousands
and tens of thousands

00:15:00.746 --> 00:15:03.063
and millions of images,

00:15:03.087 --> 00:15:05.493
or figments or fragmentary figments,

00:15:05.517 --> 00:15:11.314
all neurally encoded in particular cells
or small clusters of cells.

00:15:11.687 --> 00:15:17.076
Normally, these are all part
of the integrated stream of perception,

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:18.773
or imagination,

00:15:18.797 --> 00:15:20.835
and one is not conscious of them.

00:15:20.859 --> 00:15:24.934
It is only if one
is visually impaired or blind

00:15:24.958 --> 00:15:27.528
that the process is interrupted.

00:15:27.552 --> 00:15:30.025
And instead of getting normal perception,

00:15:30.049 --> 00:15:32.588
you're getting an anarchic,

00:15:32.612 --> 00:15:35.601
convulsive stimulation, or release,

00:15:35.625 --> 00:15:39.492
of all of these visual cells
in the inferotemporal cortex.

00:15:39.516 --> 00:15:42.305
So, suddenly, you see a face.
Suddenly, you see a car.

00:15:42.329 --> 00:15:45.043
Suddenly this and suddenly that.

00:15:45.067 --> 00:15:47.440
The mind does its best to organize

00:15:47.464 --> 00:15:50.142
and to give some sort
of coherence to this,

00:15:50.166 --> 00:15:52.705
but not terribly successfully.

00:15:52.729 --> 00:15:54.377
When these were first described,

00:15:54.401 --> 00:15:57.966
it was thought that they could be
interpreted like dreams.

00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:59.816
But, in fact, people say,

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:04.252
"I don't recognize the people.
I can't form any associations.

00:16:04.276 --> 00:16:06.226
Kermit means nothing to me."

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:11.901
You don't get anywhere,
thinking of them as dreams.

00:16:11.925 --> 00:16:16.226
Well, I've more or less
said what I wanted.

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:21.164
I think I just want to recapitulate
and say this is common.

00:16:21.188 --> 00:16:22.967
Think of the number of blind people.

00:16:22.991 --> 00:16:25.582
There must be hundreds
of thousands of blind people

00:16:25.606 --> 00:16:27.320
who have these hallucinations

00:16:27.344 --> 00:16:29.465
but are too scared to mention them.

00:16:29.489 --> 00:16:34.977
So this sort of thing
needs to be brought into notice,

00:16:35.001 --> 00:16:37.432
for patients, for doctors, for the public.

00:16:37.813 --> 00:16:42.839
Finally, I think they are
infinitely interesting and valuable,

00:16:42.863 --> 00:16:47.137
for giving one some insight
as to how the brain works.

00:16:47.161 --> 00:16:50.758
Charles Bonnet said, 250 years ago --

00:16:50.782 --> 00:16:54.226
he wondered how,
thinking of these hallucinations,

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:56.930
how, as he put it, the theater of the mind

00:16:56.954 --> 00:17:00.304
could be generated
by the machinery of the brain.

00:17:00.804 --> 00:17:03.226
Now, 250 years later,

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:06.536
I think we're beginning
to glimpse how this is done.

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:07.760
Thanks very much.

00:17:07.784 --> 00:17:10.761
(Applause)

00:17:10.785 --> 00:17:13.762
Chris Anderson: That was superb.
Thank you so much.

00:17:13.786 --> 00:17:16.756
You speak about these things
with so much insight

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:19.231
and empathy for your patients.

00:17:19.623 --> 00:17:23.443
Have you yourself experienced
any of the syndromes you write about?

00:17:23.467 --> 00:17:25.684
Oliver Sacks: I was afraid
you would ask that.

00:17:25.708 --> 00:17:27.536
(Laughter)

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:29.928
Well, yeah, a lot of them.

00:17:29.952 --> 00:17:33.019
And, actually, I'm a little
visually impaired myself.

00:17:33.043 --> 00:17:36.226
I'm blind in one eye
and not terribly good in the other.

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:40.300
And I see the geometrical hallucinations.

00:17:40.324 --> 00:17:41.797
But they stop there.

00:17:41.821 --> 00:17:43.714
CA: And they don't disturb you?

00:17:43.738 --> 00:17:46.977
Because you understand what's doing it,
it doesn't make you worried?

00:17:47.001 --> 00:17:50.226
OS: Well, they don't disturb me
any more than my tinnitus,

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:53.355
which I ignore.

00:17:53.379 --> 00:17:55.067
They occasionally interest me,

00:17:55.091 --> 00:17:58.000
and I have many pictures
of them in my notebooks.

00:17:58.024 --> 00:18:00.876
I've gone and had an fMRI myself,

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:03.955
to see how my visual cortex
is ticking over.

00:18:03.979 --> 00:18:08.133
And when I see all these hexagons

00:18:08.157 --> 00:18:10.226
and complex things, which I also have,

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:12.013
in visual migraine,

00:18:12.037 --> 00:18:14.489
I wonder whether everyone
sees things like this

00:18:14.513 --> 00:18:17.463
and whether things
like cave art or ornamental art

00:18:17.487 --> 00:18:19.561
may have been derived from them a bit.

00:18:20.059 --> 00:18:22.481
CA: That was an utterly,
utterly fascinating talk.

00:18:22.505 --> 00:18:24.317
Thank you so much for sharing.

00:18:24.341 --> 00:18:25.921
OS: Thank you. Thank you.

00:18:25.945 --> 00:18:27.833
(Applause)
