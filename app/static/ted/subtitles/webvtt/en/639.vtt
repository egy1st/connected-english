00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
♫ Where do we go from here? ♫

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
♫ How do we carry on? ♫

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
♫ I can't get beyond the questions ♫

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
♫ Clambering for the scraps ♫

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
♫ in the shatter of us, collapsed ♫

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
♫ It cuts me with every could have been ♫

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
♫ Pain on pain on play, repeating ♫

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
♫ With the backup, makeshift life in waiting ♫

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
♫ Everybody says ♫

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
♫ time heals everything ♫

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
♫ What of the wretched hollow? ♫

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
♫ The endless in between? ♫

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
♫ Are we just going to wait it out? ♫

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
♫ There is nothing to see here now ♫

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
♫ Turning the sign around ♫

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000
♫ We're closed to the Earth 'til further notice ♫

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
♫ A crumbling cliche case ♫

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
♫ crumpled and puffy faced ♫

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
♫ caught dead in the stare of a thousand miles ♫

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
♫ All I want, only one street level miracle ♫

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
♫ I'll be an out and out born again ♫

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
♫ from none more cynical ♫

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
♫ Everybody says ♫

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
♫ that time heals everything ♫

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
♫ But what of the wretched hollow? ♫

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
♫ The endless in between? ♫

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
♫ Are we just going to wait it out? ♫

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
♫ And sit here cold? ♫

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
♫ We will be long gone by then ♫

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
♫ In lackluster ♫

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
♫ In dust we lay around old magazines ♫

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
♫ Fluorescent lighting sets the scene ♫

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
♫ for all we could and should be being ♫

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
♫ in the one life that we've got ♫

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
♫ Everybody says ♫

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
♫ time heals everything ♫

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
♫ And what of the wretched hollow? ♫

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
♫ The endless in between? ♫

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
♫ Are we just going to wait it out? ♫

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
♫ Just going to sweat it out? ♫

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
♫ Just going to sweat it out? ♫

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:32.000
♫ Wait it out ♫

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
(Applause)
