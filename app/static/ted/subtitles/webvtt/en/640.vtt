00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
My name is Jonathan Zittrain,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and in my recent work I've been a bit of a pessimist.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So I thought this morning I would try to be the optimist,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and give reason to hope

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
for the future of the Internet

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
by drawing upon its present.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Now, it may seem like there is less hope today than there was before.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
People are less kind. There is less trust around.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I don't know. As a simple example,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
we could run a test here.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
How many people have ever hitchhiked?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I know. How many people have hitchhiked

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
within the past 10 years?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Right. So what has changed?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
It's not better public transportation.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So that's one reason to think that we might be

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
declensionists, going in the wrong direction.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
But I want to give you three examples

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
to try to say that the trend line

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
is in fact in the other direction,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and it's the Internet helping it along.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So example number one: the Internet itself.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
These are three of the founders of the Internet.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
They were actually high school classmates together

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
at the same high school in suburban Los Angles in the 1960s.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
You might have had a French club or a Debate club.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
They had a "Let's build a global network" club,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and it worked out very well.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
They are pictured here for their 25th anniversary

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Newsweek retrospective on the Internet.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And as you can tell,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
they are basically goof balls.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
They had one great limitation

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and one great freedom

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
as they tried to conceive of a global network.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
The limitation was that they didn't have any money.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
No particular amount of capital to invest,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
of the sort that for a physical network

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
you might need for trucks and people

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and a hub to move packages around overnight.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
They had none of that.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
But they had an amazing freedom,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
which was they didn't have to make any money from it.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
The Internet has no business plan, never did.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
No CEO,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
no firm responsible, singly, for building it.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Instead, it's folks getting together

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
to do something for fun,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
rather than because they were told to,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
or because they were expecting to make a mint off of it.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
That ethos led to a network architecture,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
a structure that was unlike

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
other digital networks then or since.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
So unusual, in fact,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
that it was said that it's not clear the Internet could work.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
As late as 1992, IBM was known to say

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
you couldn't possibly build a corporate network

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
using Internet Protocol.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And even some Internet engineers today say

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
the whole thing is a pilot project and the jury is still out.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
(Laughter)

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
That's why the mascot of Internet engineering,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
if it had one, is said to be the bumblebee.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Because the fur-to-wingspan ratio of the bumblebee

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
is far too large for it to be able to fly.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And yet, mysteriously, somehow the bee flies.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
I'm pleased to say that, thanks to massive government funding,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
about three years ago we finally figured out

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
how bees fly.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
(Laughter)

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
It's very complicated, but it turns out they

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
flap their wings very quickly.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
(Laughter)

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
So what is this bizarre architecture configuration

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
that makes the network sing and be so unusual?

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Well, to move data around

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
from one place to another -- again, it's not like a package courier.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
It's more like a mosh pit.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
(Laughter)

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Imagine, you being part of a network

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
where, you're maybe at a sporting event,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
and you're sitting in rows like this,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
and somebody asks for a beer,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
and it gets handed at the aisle.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And your neighborly duty

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
is to pass the beer along,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
at risk to your own trousers,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
to get it to the destination.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
No one pays you to do this.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
It's just part of your neighborly duty.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And, in a way, that's exactly how packets move around the Internet,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
sometimes in as many as 25 or 30 hops,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
with the intervening entities

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
that are passing the data around

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
having no particular contractual or legal obligation

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
to the original sender

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
or to the receiver.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Now, of course, in a mosh pit it's hard to specify a destination.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
You need a lot of trust,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
but it's not like, "I'm trying to get to Pensacola, please."

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
So the Internet needs addressing and directions.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
It turns out there is no one overall map of the Internet.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Instead, again, it is as if we are all sitting together in a theater,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
but we can only see amidst the fog

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
the people immediately around us.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
So what do we do to figure out who is where?

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
We turn to the person on the right,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and we tell that person what we see on our left,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
and vice versa.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
And they can lather, rinse, repeat. And before you know it,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
you have a general sense of where everything is.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000
This is how Internet addressing and routing actually work.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
This is a system that relies on kindness and trust,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
which also makes it very delicate and vulnerable.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
In rare but striking instances,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
a single lie told by just one entity

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
in this honeycomb

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
can lead to real trouble.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
So, for example, last year,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
the government of Pakistan

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
asked its Internet service providers there

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
to prevent citizens of Pakistan from seeing YouTube.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
There was a video there that the government did not like

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
and they wanted to make sure it was blocked.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
This is a common occurrence. Governments everywhere

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
are often trying to block

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
and filter and censor content on the Internet.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Well this one ISP in Pakistan

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
chose to effectuate the block for its subscribers

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
in a rather unusual way.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
It advertised --

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
the way that you might be asked, if you were part of the Internet,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
to declare what you see near you -- it advertised

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
that near it, in fact, it had suddenly awakened to find

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
that it was YouTube.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
"That's right," it said, "I am YouTube."

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Which meant that packets of data

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
from subscribers going to YouTube

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
stopped at the ISP, since they thought they were already there,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
and the ISP threw them away unopened

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
because the point was to block it.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
But it didn't stop there.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
You see, that announcement

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
went one click out,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
which got reverberated, one click out.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And it turns out that as you look

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
at the postmortem of this event,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
you have at one moment

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
perfectly working YouTube.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Then, at moment number two,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
you have the fake announcement go out.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
And within two minutes,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
it reverberates around

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
and YouTube is blocked everywhere in the world.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
If you were sitting in Oxford, England, trying to get to YouTube,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
your packets were going to Pakistan

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
and they weren't coming back.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Now just think about that.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
One of the most popular websites in the world,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
run by the most powerful company in the world,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.000
and there was nothing that YouTube or Google

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
were particularly privileged to do about it.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
And yet, somehow, within about two hours,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
the problem was fixed.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
How did this happen?

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Well, for a big clue, we turn to NANOG.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
The North American Network Operators Group,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
a group of people who,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
on a beautiful day outside,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
enter into a windowless room,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
at their terminals

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
reading email and messages

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
in fixed proportion font, like this,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
and they talk about networks.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
And some of them are mid-level employees at Internet service providers

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
around the world.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
And here is the message where one of them says,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
"Looks like we've got a live one. We have a hijacking of YouTube!

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
This is not a drill. It's not just the cluelessness

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
of YouTube engineers. I promise.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Something is up in Pakistan."

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
And they came together to help find the problem and fix it.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
So it's kind of like if your house catches on fire.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
The bad news is there is no fire brigade.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
The good news is random people apparate from nowhere,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
put out the fire and leave without expecting payment or praise.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000
(Applause)

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
I was trying to think of the right model to describe

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
this form of random acts of kindness

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
by geeky strangers.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
(Laughter)

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
You know, it's just like the hail goes out

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
and people are ready to help.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
And it turns out this model is everywhere, once you start looking for it.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Example number two: Wikipedia.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
If a man named Jimbo came up to you in 2001

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
and said, "I've got a great idea! We start with seven articles

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
that anybody can edit anything, at any time,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
and we'll get a great encyclopedia! Eh?"

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Right. Dumbest idea ever.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000
(Laughter)

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.000
In fact, Wikipedia is an idea so profoundly stupid

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
that even Jimbo never had it.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Jimbo's idea was for Nupedia.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
It was going to be totally traditional. He would pay people money

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
because he was feeling like a good guy,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
and the money would go to the people

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
and they would write the articles.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
The wiki was introduced

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
so others could make suggestions on edits --

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
as almost an afterthought, a back room.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
And then it turns out the back room grew

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
to encompass the entire project.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
And today, Wikipedia is so ubiquitous

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
that you can now find it on Chinese restaurant menus.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.000
(Laughter)

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
I am not making this up.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
(Laughter)

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
I have a theory I can explain later.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Suffice it to say for now that I prefer my Wikipedia

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
stir-fried with pimentos.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
(Laughter)

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
But now, Wikipedia doesn't just spontaneously work.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
How does it really work? It turns out

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
there is a back room that is kind of windowless,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
metaphorically speaking.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
And there are a bunch of people who, on a sunny day,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
would rather be inside

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
and monitoring this, the administrator's notice board,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
itself a wiki page that anyone can edit.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
And you just bring your problems to the page.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
It's reminiscent of the description of history

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
as "one damn thing after another," right?

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Number one: "Tendentious editing by user Andyvphil."

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Apologies, Andyvphil, if you're here today.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
I'm not taking sides.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
"Anon attacking me for reverting."

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Here is my favorite: "A long story."

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000
(Laughter)

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
It turns out there are more people checking this page for problems

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
and wanting to solve them

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
than there are problems arising on the page.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
And that's what keeps Wikipedia afloat.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
At all times, Wikipedia is approximately

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
45 minutes away from utter destruction. Right?

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
There are spambots crawling it, trying to turn every article

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
into an ad for a Rolex watch.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000
(Laughter)

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
It's this thin geeky line

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
that keeps it going.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Not because it's a job,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
not because it's a career,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
but because it's a calling.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
It's something they feel impelled to do

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
because they care about it.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
They even gather together in such groups

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
as the Counter-Vandalism Unit --

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
"Civility, Maturity, Responsibility" --

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
to just clean up the pages.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
It does make you wonder if there were, for instance,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
a massive, extremely popular Star Trek convention one weekend,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
who would be minding the store?

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
(Laughter)

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
So what we see --

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
(Laughter)

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000
what we see in this phenomenon

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
is something that the crazed, late traffic engineer

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Hans Monderman discovered in the Netherlands,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
and here in South Kensington, that sometimes

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000
if you remove some of the external rules and signs and everything else,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
you can actually end up

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
with a safer environment in which people can function,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
and one in which they are more human with each other.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
They're realizing that they

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
have to take responsibility for what they do.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
And Wikipedia has embraced this.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Some of you may remember Star Wars Kid,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
the poor teenager who filmed himself with a golf ball retriever,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
acting as if it were a light saber.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
The film, without his permission or even knowledge at first,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
found its way onto the Internet.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Hugely viral video. Extremely popular.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Totally mortifying to him.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Now, it being encyclopedic and all,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Wikipedia had to do an article about Star Wars Kid.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Every article on Wikipedia has a corresponding discussion page,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
and on the discussion page

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
they had extensive argument among the Wikipedians

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
as to whether to have his real name

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
featured in the article.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
You could see arguments on both sides.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Here is just a snapshot of some of them.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
They eventually decided --

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
not unanimously by any means --

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
not to include his real name,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
despite the fact that nearly all media reports did.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
They just didn't think it was the right thing to do.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
It was an act of kindness.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
And to this day, the page for Star Wars Kid

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
has a warning right at the top

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
that says you are not to put his real name on the page.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
If you do, it will be removed immediately,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
removed by people who may have disagreed with the original decision,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
but respect the outcome

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
and work to make it stay

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
because they believe in something bigger than their own opinion.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
As a lawyer, I've got to say these guys are inventing the law

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
and stare decisis and stuff like that as they go along.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Now, this isn't just limited to Wikipedia.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
We see it on blogs all over the place.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
I mean, this is a 2005 Business Week cover.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Wow. Blogs are going to change your business.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
I know they look silly. And sure they look silly.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
They start off on all sorts of goofy projects.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
This is my favorite goofy blog:

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Catsthatlooklikehitler.com.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.000
(Laughter)

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
You send in a picture of your cat

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
if it looks like Hitler.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:32.000
(Laughter)

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Yeah, I know. Number four, it's like, can you imagine

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
coming home to that cat everyday?

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000
(Laughter)

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
But then, you can see the same kind of whimsy

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
applied to people.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
So this is a blog devoted to unfortunate portraiture.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
This one says, "Bucolic meadow with split-rail fence.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Is that an animal carcass behind her?"

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000
(Laughter)

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
You're like, "You know? I think that's an animal carcass

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
behind her."

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
And it's one after the other.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
But then you hit this one. Image removed at request of owner.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
That's it. Image removed at request of owner.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
It turns out that somebody lampooned here

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
wrote to the snarky guy that does the site,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
not with a legal threat, not with an offer of payment,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
but just said, "Hey, would you mind?"

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
The person said, "No, that's fine."

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
I believe we can build architectures online

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
to make such human requests

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
that much easier to do,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
to make it possible for all of us to see

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
that the data we encounter online

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
is just stuff on which to click and paste and copy and forward

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
that actually represents human emotion

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
and endeavor and impact,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
and to be able to have an ethical moment

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
where we decide how we want to treat it.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
I even think it can go into the real world.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
We can end up, as we get in a world with more censors --

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
everywhere there is something filming you, maybe putting it online --

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
to be able to have a little clip you could wear

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
that says, "You know, I'd rather not."

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
And then have technology

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
that the person taking the photo will know later,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
this person requested to be contacted

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
before this goes anywhere big,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
if you don't mind.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
And that person taking the photo can make a decision

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
about how and whether to respect it.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
In the real world, we see filtering of this sort

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
taking place in Pakistan.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
And we now have means that we can build, like this system,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
so that people can report the filtering as they encounter it.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
And it's no longer just a "I don't know. I couldn't get there. I guess I'll move on,"

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
but suddenly a collective consciousness

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
about what is blocked and censored

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
where online.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
In fact, talk about technology imitating life

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
imitating tech, or maybe it's the other way around.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
An NYU researcher here took little cardboard robots

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
with smiley faces on them,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
and a motor that just drove them forward

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
and a flag sticking out the back

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
with a desired destination.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
It said, "Can you help me get there?"

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Released it on the streets of Manhattan.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
(Laughter)

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
They'll fund anything these days.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Here is the chart of over 43 people

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
helping to steer the robot that could not steer

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
and get it on its way, from one corner

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
from one corner of Washington Square Park

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
to another.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
That leads to example number three: hitchhiking.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
I'm not so sure hitchhiking is dead.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Why? There is the Craigslist rideshare board.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
If it were called the Craigslist hitchhiking board,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
tumbleweeds would be blowing through it.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
But it's the rideshare board, and it's basically the same thing.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Now why are people using it?

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
I don't know. Maybe they think that, uh, killers don't plan ahead?

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:47.000
(Laughter)

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
No. I think the actual answer is

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
that once you reframe it,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
once you get out of one set of stale expectations

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
from a failed project that had its day,

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
but now, for whatever reason, is tarnished,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000
you can actually rekindle the kind of human kindness and sharing

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
that something like this on Craigslist represents.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
And then you can highlight it

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
into something like,

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
yes, CouchSurfing.org.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
CouchSurfing: one guy's idea

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
to, at last, put together people who are going somewhere far away

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.000
and would like to sleep on a stranger's couch for free,

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
with people who live far away,

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000
and would like someone they don't know to sleep on their couch for free.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
It's a brilliant idea.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
It's a bee that, yes, flies.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
Amazing how many successful couch surfings there have been.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
And if you're wondering, no, there have been no known fatalities

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
associated with CouchSurfing.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
Although, to be sure, the reputation system, at the moment,

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
works that you leave your report after the couch surfing experience,

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
so there may be some selection bias there.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
(Laughter)

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
So, my urging, my thought,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
is that the Internet isn't just a pile of information.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
It's not a noun. It's a verb.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
And when you go on it,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
if you listen and see carefully and closely enough,

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
what you will discover

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
is that that information

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
is saying something to you.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
What it's saying to you is what we heard yesterday,

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
Demosthenes was saying to us.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000
It's saying, "Let's march." Thank you very much.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
(Applause)
