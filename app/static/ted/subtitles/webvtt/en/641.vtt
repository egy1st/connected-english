00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Good morning. I think, as a grumpy Eastern European,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I was brought in to play the pessimist this morning. So bear with me.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Well, I come from the former Soviet Republic of Belarus,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
which, as some of you may know,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
is not exactly an oasis of liberal democracy.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So that's why I've always been fascinated

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
with how technology could actually reshape

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and open up authoritarian societies like ours.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So, I'm graduating college

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and, feeling very idealistic,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I decided to join the NGO

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
which actually was using new media

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
to promote democracy and media reform

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
in much of the former Soviet Union.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
However, to my surprise,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I discovered that dictatorships

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
do not crumble so easily.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
In fact, some of them actually

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
survived the Internet challenge,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and some got even more repressive.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So this is when I ran out of my idealism and

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
decided to quit my NGO job

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and actually study how the Internet could impede democratization.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Now, I must tell you that this was never

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
a very popular argument,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and it's probably not very popular yet

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
with some of you sitting in this audience.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
It was never popular with many political leaders,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
especially those in the United States

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
who somehow thought that new media

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
would be able to do what missiles couldn't.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
That is, promote democracy in difficult places

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
where everything else has already been tried and failed.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And I think by 2009,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
this news has finally reached Britain,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
so I should probably add Gordon Brown to this list as well.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
However, there is an underlying argument about logistics,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
which has driven so much of this debate. Right?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
So if you look at it close enough,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
you'll actually see that much of this

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
is about economics.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
The cybertopians say, much like fax machines

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and Xerox machines did in the '80s,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
blogs and social networks

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
have radically transformed the economics of protest,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
so people would inevitably rebel.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
To put it very simply,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
the assumption so far has been

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
that if you give people enough connectivity,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
if you give them enough devices,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
democracy will inevitably follow.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And to tell you the truth,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I never really bought into this argument,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
in part because I never saw three American presidents

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
agree on anything else in the past.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
(Laughter)

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
But, you know, even beyond that,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
if you think about the logic underlying it,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
is something I call iPod liberalism,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
where we assume that every single Iranian or Chinese

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
who happens to have and love his iPod

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
will also love liberal democracy.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And again, I think this is kind of false.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
But I think a much bigger problem with this

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
is that this logic --

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
that we should be dropping iPods not bombs --

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I mean, it would make a fascinating title

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
for Thomas Friedman's new book.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
(Laughter)

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
But this is rarely a good sign. Right?

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
So, the bigger problem with this logic

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
is that it confuses the intended

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
versus the actual uses of technology.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
For those of you who think that

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
new media of the Internet

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
could somehow help us avert genocide,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
should look no further than Rwanda,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
where in the '90s it was actually two radio stations

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
which were responsible for fueling much of the ethnic hatred in the first place.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
But even beyond that, coming back to the Internet,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
what you can actually see

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
is that certain governments

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
have mastered the use of cyberspace

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
for propaganda purposes. Right?

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And they are building what I call the Spinternet.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
The combination of spin, on the one hand,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
and the Internet on the other.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
So governments from Russia to China to Iran

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
are actually hiring, training and paying bloggers

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
in order to leave ideological comments

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and create a lot of ideological blog posts

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
to comment on sensitive political issues. Right?

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
So you may wonder, why on Earth are they doing it?

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Why are they engaging with cyberspace?

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Well my theory is that

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
it's happening because censorship actually

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
is less effective than you think it is in many of those places.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
The moment you put something critical in a blog,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
even if you manage to ban it immediately,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
it will still spread around thousands and thousands of other blogs.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
So the more you block it,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
the more it emboldens people to actually avoid the censorship

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
and thus win in this cat-and-mouse game.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
So the only way to control this message

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
is actually to try to spin it

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and accuse anyone who has written something critical

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
of being, for example, a CIA agent.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And, again, this is happening quite often.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Just to give you an example of how it works in China, for example.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
There was a big case in February 2009

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
called "Elude the Cat."

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
And for those of you who didn't know, I'll just give a little summary.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
So what happened is that a 24-year-old man,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
a Chinese man, died in prison custody.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
And police said that it happened

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
because he was playing hide and seek,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
which is "elude the cat" in Chinese slang,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
with other inmates and hit his head

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
against the wall,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.000
which was not an explanation which sat well with many Chinese bloggers.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
So they immediately began posting a lot of critical comments.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
In fact, QQ.com, which is a popular Chinese website,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
had 35,000 comments

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
on this issue within hours.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
But then authorities did something very smart.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Instead of trying to purge these comments,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
they instead went and reached out to the bloggers.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And they basically said, "Look guys. We'd like you to become netizen investigators."

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
So 500 people applied,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
and four were selected to actually go and tour the facility in question,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
and thus inspect it and then blog about it.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Within days the entire incident was forgotten,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
which would have never happened if they simply tried to block the content.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
People would keep talking about it for weeks.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
And this actually fits with another interesting theory

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
about what's happening in authoritarian states

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
and in their cyberspace.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
This is what political scientists call authoritarian deliberation,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and it happens when governments are actually reaching out to their critics

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
and letting them engage with each other online.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
We tend to think

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
that somehow this is going to harm these dictatorships,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
but in many cases it only strengthens them.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And you may wonder why.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
I'll just give you a very short list of reasons

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
why authoritarian deliberation

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
may actually help the dictators.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
And first it's quite simple.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Most of them operate in a complete information vacuum.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
They don't really have the data they need

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
in order to identify emerging threats facing the regime.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
So encouraging people to actually go online

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
and share information and data

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
on blogs and wikis is great

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
because otherwise, low level apparatchiks and bureaucrats

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
will continue concealing what's actually happening in the country, right?

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
So from this perspective, having blogs and wikis

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
produce knowledge has been great.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Secondly, involving public in any decision making

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
is also great

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
because it helps you to share the blame

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
for the policies which eventually fail.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Because they say, "Well look, we asked you,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
we consulted you, you voted on it.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
You put it on the front page of your blog.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Well, great. You are the one who is to blame."

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
And finally, the purpose of

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
any authoritarian deliberation efforts

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
is usually to increase the legitimacy of the regimes, both at home and abroad.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
So inviting people to all sorts of public forums,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
having them participate in decision making,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
it's actually great.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Because what happens is that then

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
you can actually point to this initiative and say,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
"Well, we are having a democracy. We are having a forum."

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Just to give you an example,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
one of the Russian regions, for example,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
now involves its citizens

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
in planning its strategy up until year 2020.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Right? So they can go online

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
and contribute ideas on what that region would look like by the year 2020.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
I mean, anyone who has been to Russia would know

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
that there was no planning in Russia for the next month.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
So having people involved in planning for 2020

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
is not necessarily going to change anything,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
because the dictators are still the ones who control the agenda.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Just to give you an example from Iran,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
we all heard about the Twitter revolution

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
that happened there,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
but if you look close enough, you'll actually see

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
that many of the networks and blogs

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
and Twitter and Facebook were actually operational.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
They may have become slower,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
but the activists could still access it

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
and actually argue that having access to them

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
is actually great for many authoritarian states.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
And it's great simply because

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
they can gather open source intelligence.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
In the past it would take you weeks, if not months,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
to identify how Iranian activists connect to each other.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Now you actually know how they connect to each other

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
by looking at their Facebook page.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
I mean KGB, and not just KGB,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
used to torture in order to actually get this data.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Now it's all available online.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
(Laughter)

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
But I think the biggest conceptual pitfall

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
that cybertopians made

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
is when it comes to digital natives, people who have grown up online.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
We often hear about cyber activism,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
how people are getting more active because of the Internet.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Rarely hear about cyber hedonism, for example,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
how people are becoming passive.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Why? Because they somehow assume that the Internet

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
is going to be the catalyst of change

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
that will push young people into the streets,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
while in fact it may actually be the new opium for the masses

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
which will keep the same people in their rooms downloading pornography.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
That's not an option being considered too strongly.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
So for every digital renegade that is revolting in the streets of Tehran,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
there may as well be two digital captives

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
who are actually rebelling only in the World of Warcraft.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And this is realistic. And there is nothing wrong about it

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
because the Internet has greatly empowered many of these young people

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
and it plays a completely different social role for them.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
If you look at some of the surveys

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
on how the young people actually benefit from the Internet,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
you'll see that the number of teenagers in China, for example,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
for whom the Internet actually broadens their sex life,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
is three times more than in the United States.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
So it does play a social role,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
however it may not necessarily lead to political engagement.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
So the way I tend to think of it

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
is like a hierarchy of cyber-needs in space,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
a total rip-off from Abraham Maslow.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
But the point here is that

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
when we get the remote Russian village online,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
what will get people to the Internet

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
is not going to be the reports from Human Rights Watch.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
It's going to be pornography, "Sex and the City,"

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
or maybe watching funny videos of cats.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
So this is something you have to recognize.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
So what should we do about it?

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Well I say we have to stop thinking

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
about the number of iPods per capita

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
and start thinking about ways in which

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
we can empower intellectuals,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
dissidents, NGOs and then the members of civil society.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Because even what has been happening up 'til now

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
with the Spinternet and authoritarian deliberation,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
there is a great chance that those voices will not be heard.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
So I think we should shatter some of our utopian assumptions

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
and actually start doing something about it.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Thank you.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
(Applause)
