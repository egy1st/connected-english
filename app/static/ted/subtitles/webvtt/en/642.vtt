00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Thank you.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Two years ago, I stood on the TED stage in Arusha, Tanzania.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I spoke very briefly about one of my proudest creations.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It was a simple machine that changed my life.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Before that time,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I had never been away from my home

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
in Malawi.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I had never used a computer.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I had never seen an Internet.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
On the stage that day, I was so nervous.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
My English lost,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I wanted to vomit.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
(Laughter)

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I had never been surrounded by so many azungu,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
white people.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
(Laughter)

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
There was a story I wouldn't tell you then.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
But well, I'm feeling good right now.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I would like to share that story today.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We have seven children in my family.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
All sisters, excepting me.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
This is me with my dad when I was a little boy.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Before I discovered the wonders of science,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I was just a simple farmer

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
in a country of poor farmers.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Like everyone else, we grew maize.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
One year our fortune turned very bad.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
In 2001 we experienced an awful famine.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Within five months all Malawians began to starve to death.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
My family ate one meal per day, at night.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Only three swallows of nsima for each one of us.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
The food passes through our bodies.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
We drop down to nothing.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
In Malawi, the secondary school,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
you have to pay school fees.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Because of the hunger, I was forced to drop out of school.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I looked at my father

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and looked at those dry fields.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
It was the future I couldn't accept.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I felt very happy to be at the secondary school,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
so I was determined to do anything possible

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
to receive education.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
So I went to a library.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
I read books, science books, especially physics.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I couldn't read English that well.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
I used diagrams and pictures

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
to learn the words around them.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Another book put that knowledge in my hands.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
It said a windmill could pump water and generate electricity.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Pump water meant irrigation,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
a defense against hunger,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
which we were experiencing by that time.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
So I decided I would build one windmill for myself.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
But I didn't have materials to use,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
so I went to a scrap yard

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
where I found my materials.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Many people, including my mother,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
said I was crazy.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
(Laughter)

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
I found a tractor fan,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
shock absorber, PVC pipes.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Using a bicycle frame

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and an old bicycle dynamo,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
I built my machine.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
It was one light at first.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And then four lights,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
with switches, and even a circuit breaker,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
modeled after an electric bell.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Another machine pumps water

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
for irrigation.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Queues of people start lining up at my house

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
(Laughter)

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
to charge their mobile phone.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
(Applause)

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
I could not get rid of them.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
(Laughter)

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
And the reporters came too,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
which lead to bloggers

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
and which lead to a call from something called TED.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
I had never seen an airplane before.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
I had never slept in a hotel.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
So, on stage that day in Arusha,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
my English lost,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
I said something like,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
"I tried. And I made it."

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
So I would like to say something

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
to all the people out there like me

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
to the Africans, and the poor

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
who are struggling with your dreams.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
God bless.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Maybe one day you will watch this on the Internet.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
I say to you, trust yourself and believe.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Whatever happens, don't give up.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Thank you.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:38.000
(Applause)
