WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Okay, so

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
90 percent of my photographic process

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
is, in fact, not photographic.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It involves a campaign of letter writing,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
research and phone calls

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
to access my subjects,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
which can range from Hamas leaders in Gaza

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
to a hibernating black bear in its cave

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
in West Virginia.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And oddly, the most notable

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
letter of rejection I ever received

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
came from Walt Disney World,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
a seemingly innocuous site.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And it read -- I'm just going to read a key sentence:

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
"Especially during these violent times,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I personally believe

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
that the magical spell cast upon guests who visit our theme parks

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
is particularly important to protect

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and helps to provide them with an important fantasy

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
they can escape to."

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Photography threatens fantasy.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
They didn't want to let my camera in

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
because it confronts constructed realities, myths and beliefs,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and provides what appears to be

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
evidence of a truth.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
But there are multiple truths attached to every image,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
depending on the creator's intention, the viewer

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and the context in which it is presented.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Over a five year period following September 11th,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
when the American media and government were seeking

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
hidden and unknown sites

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
beyond its borders,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
most notably weapons of mass destruction,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I chose to look inward at that which was integral

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
to America's foundation,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
mythology and daily functioning.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I wanted to confront the boundaries of the citizen,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
self-imposed and real,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and confront the divide between privileged

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and public access to knowledge.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
It was a critical moment in American history

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and global history

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
where one felt they didn't have access to accurate information.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And I wanted to see the center with my own eyes,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
but what I came away with is a photograph.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And it's just another place from which to observe,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and the understanding that

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
there are no absolute, all-knowing insiders.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And the outsider can never really reach the core.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I'm going to run through some of the photographs in this series.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
It's titled, "An American Index

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
of the Hidden and Unfamiliar,"

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and it's comprised of nearly 70 images.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
In this context I'll just show you a few.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
This is a nuclear waste storage and encapsulation facility

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
at Hanford site in Washington State,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
where there are over 1,900

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
stainless steel capsules containing nuclear waste

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
submerged in water.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
A human standing in front of an unprotected capsule would die instantly.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And I found one section amongst all of these

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
that actually resembled the outline

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
of the United States of America,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
which you can see here.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And a big part of the work that is

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
sort of absent in this context is text.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
So I create these two poles.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Every image is accompanied with a very detailed factual text.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
And what I'm most interested in

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
is the invisible space between a text

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
and its accompanying image,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
and how the image is transformed by the text

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
and the text by the image.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
So, at best, the image is meant to float away

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
into abstraction and multiple truths and fantasy.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And then the text functions as this cruel anchor

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
that kind of nails it to the ground.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
But in this context I'm just going to read

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
an abridged version of those texts.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
This is a cryopreservation unit,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
and it holds the bodies of the wife and mother

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
of cryonics pioneer Robert Ettinger,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
who hoped to be awoken one day to extended life

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
in good health, with advancements in science and technology,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
all for the cost of 35 thousand dollars, for forever.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
This is a 21-year-old Palestinian woman

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
undergoing hymenoplasty.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Hymenoplasty is a surgical procedure which restores the virginal state,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
allowing her to adhere to certain cultural expectations

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
regarding virginity and marriage.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
So it essentially reconstructs a ruptured hymen,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
allowing her to bleed upon having sexual intercourse,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
to simulate the loss of virginity.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
This is a jury simulation deliberation room,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
and you can see beyond that two-way mirror

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
jury advisers standing in a room behind the mirror.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And they observe deliberations

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
after mock trial proceedings

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
so that they can better advise their clients how to adjust their trial strategy

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
to have the outcome that they're hoping for.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
This process costs 60,000 dollars.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
This is a U.S. Customs and Border Protection room,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
a contraband room, at John F. Kennedy International Airport.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
On that table you can see 48 hours' worth

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
of seized goods from passengers entering in to the United States.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
There is a pig's head and African cane rats.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And part of my photographic work

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
is I'm not just documenting what's there.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
I do take certain liberties and intervene.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
And in this I really wanted it to resemble

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
an early still-life painting,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
so I spent some time with the smells and items.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
This is the exhibited art on the walls of the CIA

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
in Langley, Virginia, their original headquarters building.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And the CIA has had a long history

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
with both covert and public cultural diplomacy efforts.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
And it's speculated that some of their interest in the arts

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
was designed to counter Soviet communism

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
and promote what it considered to be pro-American

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
thoughts and aesthetics.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
And one of the art forms that elicited the interest of the agency,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.000
and had thus come under question, is abstract expressionism.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
This is the Forensic Anthropology Research Facility,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
and on a six acre plot

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
there are approximately 75 cadavers at any given time

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
that are being studied by forensic anthropologists

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
and researchers who are interested in monitoring

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
a rate of corpse decomposition.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
And in this particular photograph the body of a young boy

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
has been used to reenact a crime scene.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
This is the only federally funded site

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
where it is legal to cultivate cannabis

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
for scientific research in the United States.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
It's a research crop marijuana grow room.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
And part of the work that I hope for

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
is that there is a sort of disorienting entropy

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
where you can't find any discernible formula in how these things --

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
they sort of awkwardly jump from government to science

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
to religion to security --

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
and you can't completely understand

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
how information is being distributed.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
These are transatlantic submarine communication cables

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
that travel across the floor of the Atlantic Ocean,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
connecting North America to Europe.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
They carry over 60 million simultaneous voice conversations,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
and in a lot of the government and technology sites

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
there was just this very apparent vulnerability.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
This one is almost humorous because it feels like I could

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
just snip all of that conversation in one easy cut.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
But stuff did feel like it could have been taken

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
30 or 40 years ago, like it was locked in the Cold War era

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
and hadn't necessarily progressed.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
This is a Braille edition of Playboy magazine.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
(Laughter)

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
And this is ... a division of the Library of Congress

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
produces a free national library service

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
for the blind and visually impaired,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
and the publications they choose to publish

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
are based on reader popularity.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And Playboy is always in the top few.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
(Laughter)

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
But you'd be surprised, they don't do the photographs. It's just the text.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000
(Laughter)

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
This is an avian quarantine facility

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
where all imported birds coming into America

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
are required to undergo a 30-day quarantine,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
where they are tested for diseases

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
including Exotic Newcastle Disease

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
and Avian Influenza.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
This film shows

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
the testing of a new explosive fill on a warhead.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
And the Air Armament Center

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
is responsible for the deployment and testing

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
of all air-delivered weaponry

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
coming from the United States.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
And the film was shot on 72 millimeter, government-issue film.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
And that red dot is a marking on the government-issue film.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
All living white tigers in North America

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
are the result of selective inbreeding --

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
that would be mother to son,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
father to daughter, sister to brother --

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
to allow for the genetic conditions

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
that create a salable white tiger.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Meaning white fur, ice blue eyes, a pink nose.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
And the majority of these white tigers

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
are not born in a salable state

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
and are killed at birth.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
It's a very violent process that is little known.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000
And the white tiger is obviously celebrated in several forms of entertainment.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Kenny was born. He actually made it to adulthood.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
He has since passed away,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
but was mentally retarded

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
and suffers from severe bone abnormalities.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
This, on a lighter note, is at

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
George Lucas' personal archive.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
This is the Death Star.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
And it's shown here in its true orientation.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
In the context of "Star Wars: Return of the Jedi,"

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
its mirror image is presented.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
They flip the negative.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
And you can see the photoetched brass detailing,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
and the painted acrylic facade.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
In the context of the film,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
this is a deep-space battle station of the Galactic Empire,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
capable of annihilating planets and civilizations,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
and in reality it measures about four feet by two feet.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
(Laughter)

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
This is at Fort Campbell in Kentucky.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
It's a Military Operations on Urbanized Terrain site.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Essentially they've simulated a city

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
for urban combat,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
and this is one of the structures that exists in that city.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
It's called the World Church of God.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
It's supposed to be a generic site of worship.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
And after I took this photograph,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
they constructed a wall around the World Church of God

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
to mimic the set-up of mosques in Afghanistan or Iraq.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
And I worked with Mehta Vihar

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
who creates virtual simulations for the army

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
for tactical practice.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
And we put that wall around the World Church of God,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
and also used the characters and vehicles and explosions

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
that are offered in the video games for the army.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
And I put them into my photograph.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
This is live HIV virus

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
at Harvard Medical School, who is working with the U.S. Government

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
to develop sterilizing immunity.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
And Alhurra is a U.S. Government- sponsored

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Arabic language television network

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
that distributes news and information to over 22 countries in the Arab world.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
It runs 24 hours a day, commercial free.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000
However, it's illegal to broadcast Alhurra within the United States.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
And in 2004, they developed a channel called Alhurra Iraq,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
which specifically deals with events occurring in Iraq

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
and is broadcast to Iraq.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Now I'm going to move on to another project I did.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
It's titled "The Innocents."

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And for the men in these photographs,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
photography had been used to create a fantasy.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Contradicting its function as evidence of a truth,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
in these instances it furthered the fabrication of a lie.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
I traveled across the United States

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
photographing men and women who had been wrongfully convicted

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
of crimes they did not commit, violent crimes.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
I investigate photography's ability to blur truth and fiction,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
and its influence on memory,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
which can lead to severe, even lethal consequences.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
For the men in these photographs,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
the primary cause of their wrongful conviction

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
was mistaken identification.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
A victim or eyewitness identifies

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
a suspected perpetrator

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
through law enforcement's use of images.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
But through exposure to composite sketches,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Polaroids, mug shots and line-ups,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
eyewitness testimony can change.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
I'll give you an example from a case.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
A woman was raped and presented with a series of photographs

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
from which to identify her attacker.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
She saw some similarities in one of the photographs,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
but couldn't quite make a positive identification.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Days later, she is presented with another photo array

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
of all new photographs,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
except that one photograph that she had some draw to

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
from the earlier array is repeated in the second array.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
And a positive identification is made

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
because the photograph replaced the memory,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
if there ever was an actual memory.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Photography offered the criminal justice system

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
a tool that transformed innocent citizens into criminals,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
and the criminal justice system failed to recognize the limitations

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
of relying on photographic identifications.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Frederick Daye, who is photographed at his alibi location,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
where 13 witnesses placed him at the time of the crime.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
He was convicted by an all-white jury

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
of rape, kidnapping and vehicle theft.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
And he served 10 years of a life sentence.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Now DNA exonerated Frederick

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
and it also implicated another man

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
who was serving time in prison.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
But the victim refused to press charges

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
because she claimed that law enforcement

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
had permanently altered her memory through the use of Frederick's photograph.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Charles Fain was convicted of kidnapping, rape and murder

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
of a young girl walking to school.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
He served 18 years of a death sentence.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
I photographed him at the scene of the crime

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
at the Snake River in Idaho.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
And I photographed all of the wrongfully convicted

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000
at sites that came to particular significance

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
in the history of their wrongful conviction.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
The scene of arrest, the scene of misidentification,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
the alibi location.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
And here, the scene of the crime, it's this place

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
to which he's never been, but changed his life forever.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
So photographing there, I was hoping to highlight

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
the tenuous relationship between truth and fiction,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000
in both his life and in photography.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Calvin Washington was convicted of capital murder.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000
He served 13 years of a life sentence in Waco, Texas.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Larry Mayes, I photographed at the scene of arrest,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
where he hid between two mattresses in Gary, Indiana,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
in this very room to hide from the police.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
He ended up serving 18 and a half years

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
of an 80 year sentence for rape and robbery.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
The victim failed to identify Larry

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
in two live lineups

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
and then made a positive identification, days later,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
from a photo array.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Larry Youngblood served eight years of a 10 and half year sentence

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
in Arizona for the abduction and repeated sodomizing

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
of a 10 year old boy at a carnival.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
He is photographed at his alibi location.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Ron Williamson. Ron was convicted of the rape and murder

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
of a barmaid at a club,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
and served 11 years of a death sentence.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
I photographed Ron at a baseball field

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
because he had been drafted to the Oakland A's

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
to play professional baseball just before his conviction.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
And the state's key witness in Ron's case

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
was, in the end, the actual perpetrator.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Ronald Jones served eight years of a death sentence

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
for rape and murder of a 28-year-old woman.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000
I photographed him at the scene of arrest in Chicago.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
William Gregory was convicted of rape and burglary.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
He served seven years of a 70 year sentence in Kentucky.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Timothy Durham, who I photographed at his alibi location

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
where 11 witnesses placed him at the time of the crime,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
was convicted of 3.5 years

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000
of a 3220 year sentence,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
for several charges of rape and robbery.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
He had been misidentified by an 11-year-old victim.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Troy Webb is photographed here at the scene of the crime in Virginia.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
He was convicted of rape, kidnapping and robbery,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
and served seven years of a 47 year sentence.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Troy's picture was in a photo array

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
that the victim tentatively had some draw toward,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
but said he looked too old.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
The police went and found a photograph of Troy Webb

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
from four years earlier,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
which they entered into a photo array days later,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
and he was positively identified.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
Now I'm going to leave you with a self portrait.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
And it reiterates that distortion is a constant,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
and our eyes are easily deceived.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
That's it. Thank you.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:11.000
(Applause)
