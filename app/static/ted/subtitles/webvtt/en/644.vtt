WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Clearly, we're living in a moment of crisis.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Arguably the financial markets have failed us

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and the aid system is failing us,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and yet I stand firmly with the optimists

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
who believe that there has probably never been a more exciting moment to be alive.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Because of some of technologies we've been talking about.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Because of the resources, the skills,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and certainly the surge of talent we're seeing all around the world,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
with the mindset to create change.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And we've got a president who sees himself as a global citizen,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
who recognizes that no longer is there a single superpower,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
but that we've got to engage in a different way with the world.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And by definition, every one of you who is in this room

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
must consider yourself a global soul,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
a global citizen.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
You work on the front lines. And you've seen the best and the worst

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
that human beings can do for one another and to one another.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And no matter what country you live or work in,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
you've also seen the extraordinary things that individuals are capable of,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
even in their most ordinariness.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Today there is a raging debate

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
as to how best we lift people out of poverty,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
how best we release their energies.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
On the one hand, we have people that say

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
the aid system is so broken we need to throw it out.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And on the other we have people who say

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
the problem is that we need more aid.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And what I want to talk about is something that compliments both systems.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
We call it patient capital.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
The critics point to the 500 billion dollars spent

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
in Africa since 1970

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and say, and what do we have but environmental degradation

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and incredible levels of poverty, rampant corruption?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
They use Mobutu as metaphor.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And their policy prescription is to

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
make government more accountable,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
focus on the capital markets,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
invest, don't give anything away.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
On the other side, as I said, there are those who say

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
the problem is that we need more money.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
That when it comes to the rich, we'll bail out

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and we'll hand a lot of aid,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
but when it comes to our poor brethren,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
we want little to do with it.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
They point to the successes of aid:

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
the eradication of smallpox,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and the distribution of tens of millions

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
of malaria bed nets and antiretrovirals.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Both sides are right.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And the problem is that neither side is listening to the other.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Even more problematic, they're not listening to

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
poor people themselves.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
After 25 years of working on issues of

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
poverty and innovation,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
it's true that there are probably no more market-oriented

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
individuals on the planet

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
than low-income people.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
They must navigate markets daily,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
making micro-decisions, dozens and dozens,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
to move their way through society,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and yet if a single catastrophic health problem

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
impacts their family,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
they could be put back into poverty, sometimes for generations.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And so we need both the market

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
and we need aid.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Patient capital works between,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
and tries to take the best of both.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
It's money that's invested in entrepreneurs who know their communities

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and are building solutions

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
to healthcare, water, housing, alternative energy,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
thinking of low income people not as passive recipients of charity,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
but as individual customers, consumers, clients,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
people who want to make decisions in their own lives.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Patient capital requires that we have

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
incredible tolerance for risk,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
a long time horizon in terms of allowing those

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
entrepreneurs time to experiment,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
to use the market as the best listening device that we have,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and the expectation of below-market returns,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
but outsized social impact.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
It recognizes that the market has its limitation,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
and so patient capital also works

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
with smart subsidy to extend the benefits of a global economy

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
to include all people.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Now, entrepreneurs need patient capital

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
for three reasons.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
First, they tend to work in markets

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
where people make one, two, three dollars a day

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
and they are making all of their decisions within that income level.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Second, the geographies in which they work

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
have terrible infrastructure --

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
no roads to speak of, sporadic electricity

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
and high levels of corruption.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Third, they are often creating markets.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Even if you're bringing clean water

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
for the first time into rural villages, it is something new.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
And so many low-income people

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
have seen so many failed promises broken

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and seen so many quacks and sporadic medicines offered to them

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
that building trust takes a lot of time,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
takes a lot of patience.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
It also requires being connected to a lot of management assistance.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Not only to build the systems,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
the business models that allow us

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
to reach low income people in a sustainable way,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
but to connect those business

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
to other markets, to governments, to corporations --

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
real partnerships if we want to get to scale.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
I want to share one story

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
about an innovation called drip irrigation.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
In 2002 I met this incredible entrepreneur

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
named Amitabha Sadangi from India,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
who'd been working for 20 years with some of the poorest farmers on the planet.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And he was expressing his frustration

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
that the aid market had bypassed low-income farmers altogether,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
despite the fact that 200 million farmers

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
alone in India make under a dollar a day.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
They were creating subsidies

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
either for large farms,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
or they were giving inputs to the farmers

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
that they thought they should use, rather than

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
that the farmers wanted to use.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
At the same time Amitabha was

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
obsessed with this drip irrigation technology

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
that had been invented in Israel.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
It was a way of bringing small amounts of water

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
directly to the stalk of the plant.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And it could transform

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
swaths of desert land into fields of emerald green.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
But the market also had bypassed low income farmers,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
because these systems were both too expensive,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
and they were constructed for fields that were too large.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
The average small village farmer

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
works on two acres or less.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
And so, Amitabha decided that he would take that innovation

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
and he would redesign it from the perspective

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
of the poor farmers themselves,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
because he spent so many years listening to what they needed

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
not what he thought that they should have.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
And he used three fundamental principles.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
The first one was miniaturization.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
The drip irrigation system

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
had to be small enough that a farmer only had

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
to risk a quarter acre,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
even if he had two,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
because it was too frightening, given all that he had at stake.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Second, it had to be extremely affordable.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
In other words, that risk on the quarter acre

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
needed to be repaid in a single harvest,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
or else they wouldn't take the risk.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
And third, it had to be what Amitabha calls

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
infinitely expandable.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
What I mean is with the profits from the first quarter acre,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
the farmers could buy a second

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
and a third and a fourth.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
As of today, IDE India, Amitabha's organization,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
has sold over 300,000 farmers these systems

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
and has seen their yields and incomes

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
double or triple on average,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
but this didn't happen overnight.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
In fact, when you go back to the beginning,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
there were no private investors

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
who would be willing to take a risk on building a new technology

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
for a market class that made under a dollar a day,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
that were known to be some of the most risk-averse people on the planet

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
and that were working in one of the riskiest sectors, agriculture.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
And so we needed grants. And he used significant grants

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
to research, to experiment, to fail,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
to innovate and try again.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
And when he had a prototype

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
and had a better understanding of how to market to farmers,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
that's when patient capital could come in.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
And we helped him build a company, for profit,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
that would build on IDE's knowledge,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
and start looking at sales and exports,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
and be able to tap into other kinds of capital.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Secondarily, we wanted to see if we could export

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
this drip irrigation and bring it into other countries.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
And so we met Dr. Sono Khangharani in Pakistan.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
And while, again, you needed patience

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
to move a technology for the poor

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
in India into Pakistan,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
just to get the permits,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
over time we were able to start a company

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
with Dr. Sono, who runs a large

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
community development organization in the Thar Desert,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
which is one of the remote and poorest areas of the country.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
And though that company has just started,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
our assumption is that there too

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
we'll see the impact on millions.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
But drip irrigation isn't the only innovation.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
We're starting to see these happening all around the world.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
In Arusha, Tanzania, A to Z Textile Manufacturing

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
has worked in partnership with us,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
with UNICEF, with the Global Fund,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
to create a factory that now employs 7,000 people, mostly women.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
And they produce 20 million lifesaving bednets

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
for Africans around the world.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Lifespring Hospital

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
is a joint venture between Acumen and the government of India

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
to bring quality, affordable maternal health care

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
to low-income women,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
and it's been so successful that it's currently building

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000
a new hospital every 35 days.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
And 1298 Ambulances decided that it was going to

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
reinvent a completely broken industry,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
building an ambulance service in Bombay

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
that would use the technology of Google Earth,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
a sliding scale pricing system

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
so that all people could have access,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
and a severe and public decision

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
not to engage in any form of corruption.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
So that in the terrorist attacks of November

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
they were the first responder,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
and are now beginning to scale, because of partnership.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
They've just won four government contracts to build off their 100 ambulances,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
and are one of the largest and most effective ambulance companies

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
in India.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
This idea of scale is critical.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Because we're starting to see these enterprises

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
reach hundreds of thousands of people. All of the ones I discussed

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
have reached at least a quarter million people.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
But that's obviously not enough.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
And it's where the idea of partnership

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
becomes so important.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Whether it's by finding those innovations

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
that can access the capital markets,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
government itself, or partner with major corporations,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
there is unbelievable opportunity for innovation.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
President Obama understands that.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
He recently authorized the creation of a Social Innovation Fund

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
to focus on what works in this country,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
and look at how we can scale it.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
And I would submit that it's time to consider

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
a global innovation fund

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
that would find these entrepreneurs around the world

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
who really have innovations, not only for their country,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
but ones that we can use in the developed world as well.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Invest financial assistance, but also management assistance.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
And then measure the returns,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
both from a financial perspective

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
and from a social impact perspective.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
When we think about new approaches to aid,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
it's impossible not to talk about Pakistan.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
We've had a rocky relationship with that country

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
and, in all fairness,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
the United States has not always been a very reliable partner.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
But again I would say that this is our moment

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
for extraordinary things to happen.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
And if we take that notion of a global innovation fund,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
we could use this time to invest

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
not directly in government, though we would have government's blessing,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
nor in international experts,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
but in the many existing entrepreneurs

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
and civil society leaders

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
who already are building wonderful innovations

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
that are reaching people all across the country.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
People like Rashani Zafar,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
who created one of the largest microfinance banks in the country,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
and is a real role model for women inside and outside the country.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
And Tasneem Siddiqui, who developed a way

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
called incremental housing,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
where he has moved 40,000 slum dwellers

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
into safe, affordable community housing.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Educational initiatives like DIL and The Citizen Foundation

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
that are building schools across the country.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
It's not hyperbole

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
to say that these civil society institutions

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
and these social entrepreneurs

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
are building real alternatives to the Taliban.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
I've invested in Pakistan for over seven years now,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
and those of you who've also worked there

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
can attest that Pakistanis are an incredibly hard working population,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000
and there is a fierce upward mobility in their very nature.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
President Kennedy said that

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
those who make peaceful revolution impossible

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
make violent revolution inevitable.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
I would say that the converse is true.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
That these social leaders

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
who really are looking at innovation

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
and extending opportunity

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
to the 70 percent of Pakistanis who make less than two dollars a day,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
provide real pathways to hope.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
And as we think about how we construct aid for Pakistan,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
while we need to strengthen the judiciary,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
build greater stability,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
we also need to think about lifting those leaders

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
who can be role models for the rest of the world.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
On one of my last visits to Pakistan,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
I asked Dr. Sono if he would take me

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
to see some of the drip irrigation in the Thar Desert.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
And we left Karachi one morning before dawn.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
It was about 115 degrees.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
And we drove for eight hours

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
along this moonscape-like landscape

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
with very little color, lots of heat,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
very little discussion, because we were exhausted.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
And finally, at the end of the journey,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
I could see this thin little yellow line across the horizon.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
And as we got closer, its significance became apparent.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
That there in the desert

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
was a field of sunflowers growing seven feet tall.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Because one of the poorest farmers on Earth

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
had gotten access to a technology

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
that had allowed him to change his own life.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
His name was Raja,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
and he had kind, twinkly hazel eyes

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
and warm expressive hands

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
that reminded me of my father.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
And he said it was the first dry season

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
in his entire life that he hadn't taken

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
his 12 children and 50 grandchildren

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
on a two day journey across the desert

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
to work as day laborers at a commercial farm

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
for about 50 cents a day.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Because he was building these crops.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
And with the money he earned he could stay this year.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
And for the first time ever in three generations,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
his children would go to school.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
We asked him if he would send his daughters as well as his sons.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
And he said, "Of course I will.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Because I don't want them discriminated against anymore."

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
When we think about solutions to poverty,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
we cannot deny individuals

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
their fundamental dignity.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Because at the end of the day,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000
And what's exciting is to see so many entrepreneurs across sectors

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
who are building innovations that recognize

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
that what people want is freedom

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
and choice and opportunity.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Because that is where dignity really starts.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Martin Luther King said that

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
love without power is anemic and sentimental,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
and that power without love

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
is reckless and abusive.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
Our generation has seen both approaches tried,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
and often fail.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
But I think our generation also might be the first

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
to have the courage to embrace both love and power.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
For that is what we'll need, as we move forward

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
to dream and imagine what it will really take

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
to build a global economy that includes all of us,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
and to finally extend that fundamental proposition

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
that all men are created equal to every human being on the planet.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
The time for us to begin innovating

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
and looking for new solutions, a cross sector, is now.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
I can only talk from my own experience,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
but in eight years of running Acumen fund,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
I've seen the power of patient capital.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Not only to inspire innovation and risk taking,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
but to truly build systems that have created

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
more than 25,000 jobs

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
and delivered tens of millions of services and products

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
to some of the poorest people on the planet.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
I know it works.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
But I know that many other kinds of innovation also work.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
And so I urge you, in whatever sector you work,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
in whatever job you do,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
to start thinking about how we might

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
build solutions that start

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
from the perspective of those we're trying to help.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Rather than what we think that they might need.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
It will take embracing the world with both arms.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000
And it will take living with the spirit of generosity and accountability,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
with a sense of integrity and perseverance.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
And yet these are the very qualities

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
for which men and women have been honored

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
throughout the generations.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
And there is so much good that we can do.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Just think of all those sunflowers in the desert.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Thank you.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
(Applause)
