WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Do we live in a borderless world?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Before you answer that, have a look at this map.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Contemporary political map shows

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
that we have over 200 countries in the world today.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
That's probably more than at any time in centuries.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Now, many of you will object.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
For you this would be a more appropriate map.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
You could call it TEDistan.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
In TEDistan, there are no borders,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
just connected spaces and unconnected spaces.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Most of you probably reside in one of the 40 dots

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
on this screen, of the many more

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
that represent 90 percent of the world economy.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
But let's talk about the 90 percent of the world population

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
that will never leave the place in which they were born.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
For them, nations, countries, boundaries, borders still matter a great deal,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and often violently.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Now here at TED, we're solving some of the great

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
riddles of science and mysteries of the universe.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Well here is a fundamental problem we have not solved:

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
our basic political geography.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
How do we distribute ourselves around the world?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Now this is important, because border conflicts

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
justify so much of the world's military-industrial complex.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Border conflicts can derail

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
so much of the progress that we hope to achieve here.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So I think we need a deeper understanding

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
of how people, money, power,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
religion, culture, technology

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
interact to change the map of the world.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And we can try to anticipate those changes,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and shape them in a more constructive direction.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
So we're going to look at some maps of the past,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
the present and some maps you haven't seen

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
in order to get a sense of where things are going.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Let's start with the world of 1945.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
1945 there were just 100 countries in the world.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
After World War II, Europe was devastated,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
but still held large overseas colonies:

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
French West Africa, British East Africa, South Asia, and so forth.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Then over the late '40s,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
'50s, '60s, '70s and '80s,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
waves of decolonization took place.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Over 50 new countries were born.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
You can see that Africa has been fragmented.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, South East Asian nations created.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Then came the end of the Cold War.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
The end of the Cold War and the disintegration of the Soviet Union.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
You had the creation of new states in Eastern Europe,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
the former Yugoslav republics and the Balkans,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and the 'stans of central Asia.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Today we have 200 countries in the world.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
The entire planet is covered

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
by sovereign, independent nation-states.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Does that mean that someone's gain has to be someone else's loss?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Let's zoom in on one of the most strategic areas of the world,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Eastern Eurasia.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
As you can see on this map,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Russia is still the largest country in the world.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And as you know, China is the most populous.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And they share a lengthy land border.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
What you don't see on this map

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
is that most of Russia's 150 million people

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
are concentrated in its western provinces

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and areas that are close to Europe.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
And only 30 million people are in its eastern areas.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
In fact, the World Bank predicts

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
that Russia's population is declining

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
towards about 120 million people

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And there is another thing that you don't see on this map.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Stalin, Khrushchev and other Soviet leaders

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
forced Russians out to the far east

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
to be in gulags, labor camps,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
nuclear cities, whatever the case was.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
But as oil prices rose,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Russian governments have invested in infrastructure

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
to unite the country, east and west.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
But nothing has more perversely impacted

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Russia's demographic distribution,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
because the people in the east, who never wanted to be there anyway,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
have gotten on those trains and roads

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
and gone back to the west.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
As a result, in the Russian far east today,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
which is twice the size of India,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
you have exactly six million Russians.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
So let's get a sense of what is happening in this part of the world.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
We can start with Mongolia, or as some call it, Mine-golia.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Why do they call it that?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Because in Mine-golia, Chinese firms operate

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
and own most of the mines -- copper, zinc, gold --

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and they truck the resources south and east into mainland China.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
China isn't conquering Mongolia.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
It's buying it.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Colonies were once conquered. Today countries are bought.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
So let's apply this principle to Siberia.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Siberia most of you probably think of

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
as a cold, desolate, unlivable place.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
But in fact, with global warming and rising temperatures,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
all of a sudden you have vast wheat fields

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
and agribusiness, and grain being produced in Siberia.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
But who is it going to feed?

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Well, just on the other side of the Amo River,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
in the Heilongjiang and Harbin provinces of China,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
you have over 100 million people.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
That's larger than the entire population of Russia.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Every single year, for at least a decade or more,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
[60,000] of them have been voting with their feet,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
crossing, moving north and inhabiting this desolate terrain.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
They set up their own bazaars and medical clinics.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
They've taken over the timber industry

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
and been shipping the lumber east, back into China.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Again, like Mongolia,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
China isn't conquering Russia. It's just leasing it.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
That's what I call globalization Chinese style.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Now maybe this is what the map of the region

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
might look like in 10 to 20 years.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
But hold on. This map is 700 years old.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
This is the map of the Yuan Dynasty,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
led by Kublai Khan, the grandson of Genghis Khan.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
So history doesn't necessarily repeat itself,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
but it does rhyme.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
This is just to give you a taste of what's happening in this part of the world.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Again, globalization Chinese style.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Because globalization opens up all kinds of ways for us to

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
undermine and change the way we think about political geography.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
So, the history of East Asia in fact,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
people don't think about nations and borders.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
They think more in terms of empires and hierarchies,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
usually Chinese or Japanese.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Well it's China's turn again.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
So let's look at how China is re-establishing

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
that hierarchy in the far East.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
It starts with the global hubs.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Remember the 40 dots on the nighttime map

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
that show the hubs of the global economy?

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
East Asia today has more of those global hubs

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
than any other region in the world.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Tokyo, Seoul, Beijing, Shanghai,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Hong Kong, Singapore and Sidney.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
These are the filters and funnels of global capital.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Trillions of dollars a year are being brought into the region,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
so much of it being invested into China.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Then there is trade.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
These vectors and arrows represent ever stronger

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
trade relationships that China has

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
with every country in the region.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Specifically, it targets Japan

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
and Korea and Australia,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
countries that are strong allies of the United States.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Australia, for example, is heavily dependent

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
on exporting iron ore and natural gas to China.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
For poorer countries, China reduces tariffs

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
so that Laos and Cambodia can sell their goods more cheaply

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
and become dependent on exporting to China as well.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And now many of you have been reading in the news

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
how people are looking to China

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
to lead the rebound, the economic rebound, not just in Asia, but potentially for the world.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
The Asian free trade zone, almost free trade zone, that's emerging

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
now has a greater trade volume than trade across the Pacific.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
So China is becoming the anchor of the economy in the region.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Another pillar of this strategy is diplomacy.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
China has signed military agreements with many countries in the region.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
It has become the hub of diplomatic institutions

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
such as the East Asian Community.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Some of these organizations don't even have

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
the United States as a member.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
There is a treaty of nonaggression between countries,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
such that if there were a conflict between China and the United States,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
most countries vow to just sit it out,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
including American allies like Korea and Australia.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Another pillar of the strategy,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
like Russia, is demographic.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
China exports business people, nannies, students,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
teachers to teach Chinese around the region,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
to intermarry and to occupy ever greater

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
commanding heights of the economies.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Already ethnic Chinese people

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
in Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
are the real key factors and drivers

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
in the economies there.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Chinese pride is resurgent in the region

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
as a result.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Singapore, for example, used to ban Chinese language education.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Now it encourages it.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
If you add it all up what do you get?

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Well, if you remember before World War II,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Japan had a vision

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
for a greater Japanese co-prosperity sphere.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
What's emerging today is what you might call

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
a greater Chinese co-prosperity sphere.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
So no matter what the lines on the map tell you

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
in terms of nations and borders,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
what you really have emerging in the far east

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
are national cultures,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
but in a much more fluid, imperial zone.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
All of this is happening without firing a shot.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
That's most certainly not the case in the Middle East

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
where countries are still very uncomfortable

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
in the borders left behind by European colonialists.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
So what can we do to think about borders differently in this part of the world?

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
What lines on the map should we focus on?

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
What I want to present to you is what I call

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
state building, day by day.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Let's start with Iraq.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Six years after the U.S. invasion of Iraq,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
the country still exists more on a map than it does in reality.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Oil used to be one of the forces holding Iraq together;

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000
now it is the most significant cause of the country's disintegration.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
The reason is Kurdistan.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
The Kurds for 3,000 years

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
have been waging a struggle for independence,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
and now is their chance to finally have it.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
These are pipeline routes, which emerge from Kurdistan,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
which is an oil-rich region.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
And today, if you go to Kurdistan,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
you'll see that Kurdish Peshmerga guerillas

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
are squaring off against the Sunni Iraqi army.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
But what are they guarding?

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Is it really a border on the map?

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
No. It's the pipelines.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
If the Kurds can control their pipelines, they can set the terms

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
of their own statehood.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Now should we be upset about this, about the potential disintegration of Iraq?

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
I don't believe we should.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Iraq will still be the second largest oil producer in the world,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
behind Saudi Arabia.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
And we'll have a chance to solve a 3,000 year old dispute.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Now remember Kurdistan is landlocked.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
It has no choice but to behave.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
In order to profit from its oil

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
it has to export it through Turkey or Syria,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
and other countries, and Iraq itself.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
And therefore it has to have amicable relations with them.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Now lets look at a perennial conflict in the region.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
That is, of course, in Palestine.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Palestine is something of a cartographic anomaly

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
because it's two parts Palestinian, one part Israel.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
30 years of rose garden diplomacy

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
have not delivered us peace in this conflict.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
What might? I believe that what might

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
solve the problem is infrastructure.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Today donors are spending billions of dollars on this.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
These two arrows are an arc,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
an arc of commuter railroads and other infrastructure

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
that link the West Bank and Gaza.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
If Gaza can have a functioning port

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
and be linked to the West Bank, you can have a viable Palestinian state,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Palestinian economy.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
That, I believe, is going to bring peace to this particular conflict.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
The lesson from Kurdistan and from Palestine

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
is that independence alone, without infrastructure,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
is futile.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Now what might this entire region look like

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
if in fact we focus on other lines on the map besides borders,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
when the insecurities might abate?

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
The last time that was the case was actually

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
a century ago, during the Ottoman Empire.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
This is the Hejaz Railway.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
The Hejaz Railway ran from Istanbul to Medina via Damascus.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
It even had an offshoot running to Haifa

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
in what is today Israel, on the Mediterranean Sea.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
But today the Hejaz Railway lies in tatters, ruins.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
If we were to focus on reconstructing these curvy lines on the map,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
infrastructure, that cross the straight lines, the borders,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
I believe the Middle East would be a far more peaceful region.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Now let's look at another part of the world,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
the former Soviet Republics of Central Asia, the 'stans.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
These countries' borders originate from Stalin's decrees.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
He purposely did not want these countries to make sense.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
He wanted ethnicities to mingle

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
in ways that would allow him to divide and rule.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Fortunately for them, most of their oil and gas resources

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
were discovered after the Soviet Union collapsed.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Now I know some of you may be thinking, "Oil, oil, oil.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Why is it all he's talking about is oil?"

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Well, there is a big difference in the way we used to talk about oil

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
and the way we're talking about it now.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Before it was, how do we control their oil?

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Now it's their oil for their own purposes.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
And I assure you it's every bit as important to them

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
as it might have been to colonizers and imperialists.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Here are just some of the pipeline projections

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
and possibilities and scenarios

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
and routes that are being mapped out for the next several decades.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
A great deal of them.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
For a number of countries in this part of the world,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
having pipelines is the ticket to becoming part of the global economy

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
and for having some meaning

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
besides the borders that they are not loyal to themselves.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Just take Azerbaijan.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Azerbaijan was a forgotten corner of the Caucuses,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
but now with the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline into Turkey,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
it has rebranded itself as the frontier of the west.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Then there is Turkmenistan, which most people think of

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
as a frozen basket case.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
But now it's contributing gas across the Caspian Sea

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
to provide for Europe,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
and even a potentially Turkmen-

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Afghan-Pakistan-India pipeline as well.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Then there is Kazakhstan, which didn't even have a name before.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
It was more considered South Siberia during the Soviet Union.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Today most people recognize Kazakhstan

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
as an emerging geopolitical player. Why?

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Because it has shrewdly designed pipelines to flow across the Caspian,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
north through Russia, and even east to China.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
More pipelines means more silk roads, instead of the Great Game.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
The Great Game connotes dominance of one over the other.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Silk road connotes independence and mutual trust.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
The more pipelines we have, the more silk roads we'll have,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
and the less of a dominant Great Game competition

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
we'll have in the 21st century.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Now let's look at the only part of the world that really has brought down its borders,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
and how that has enhanced its strength.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
And that is, of course, Europe.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
The European Union began as just the coal and steel community of six countries,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
and their main purpose was really to keep the rehabilitation of Germany

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
to happen in a peaceful way.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
But then eventually it grew into 12 countries,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
and those are the 12 stars on the European flag.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
The E.U. also became a currency block,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
and is now the most powerful trade block in the entire world.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
On average, the E.U. has grown by one country per year

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
since the end of the Cold War.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
In fact most of that happened on just one day.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
In 2004, 15 new countries joined the E.U.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
and now you have what most people consider

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
a zone of peace spanning 27 countries

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
and 450 million people.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
So what is next? What is the future of the European Union?

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Well in light blue, you see the zones

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
or the regions that are at least two-thirds

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
or more dependent on the European Union

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
for trade and investment.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
What does that tell us? Trade and investment tell us

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
that Europe is putting its money where its mouth is.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Even if these regions aren't part of the E.U.,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
they are becoming part of its sphere of influence.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Just take the Balkans. Croatia, Serbia

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Bosnia, they're not members of the E.U. yet.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
But you can get on a German ICE train

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
and make it almost to Albania.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
In Bosnia you use the Euro currency already,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
and that's the only currency they're probably ever going to have.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000
So, looking at other parts of Europe's periphery, such as North Africa.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
On average, every year or two,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
a new oil or gas pipeline opens up under the Mediterranean,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
connecting North Africa to Europe.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
That not only helps Europe diminish its reliance

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
on Russia for energy,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
but if you travel to North Africa today, you'll hear more and more people saying

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
that they don't really think of their region as the Middle East.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
So in other words, I believe that President Sarkozy of France

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
is right when he talks about a Mediterranean union.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Now let's look at Turkey and the Caucasus.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
I mentioned Azerbaijan before.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
That corridor of Turkey and the Caucasus

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
has become the conduit for 20 percent

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
of Europe's energy supply.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
So does Turkey really have to be a member of the European Union?

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
I don't think it does. I think it's already part of

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
a Euro-Turkish superpower.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
So what's next? Where are we going to see borders change

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
and new countries born?

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Well, South Central Asia, South West Asia

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
is a very good place to start.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Eight years after the U.S. invaded Afghanistan

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
there is still a tremendous amount of instability.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Pakistan and Afghanistan are still so fragile

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
that neither of them have dealt constructively

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
with the problem of Pashtun nationalism.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
This is the flag that flies in the minds

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
of 20 million Pashtuns

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
who live on both sides of the Afghan and Pakistan border.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Let's not neglect the insurgency just to the south,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Balochistan. Two weeks ago,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Balochi rebels attacked a Pakistani military garrison,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
and this was the flag that they raised over it.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
The post-colonial entropy

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
that is happening around the world is accelerating,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
and I expect more such changes to occur in the map

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
as the states fragment.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Of course, we can't forget Africa.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
53 countries, and by far the most number

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
of suspiciously straight lines on the map.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
If we were to look at all of Africa

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
we could most certainly acknowledge far more,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
tribal divisions and so forth.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
But let's just look at Sudan, the second-largest country in Africa.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
It has three ongoing civil wars,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
the genocide in Darfur, which you all know about,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
the civil war in the east of the country,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
and south Sudan.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
South Sudan is going to be having a referendum in 2011

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
in which it is very likely to vote itself independence.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Now let's go up to the Arctic Circle.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
There is a great race on for energy resources

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
under the Arctic seabed.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Who will win? Canada? Russia? The United States?

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
Actually Greenland.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
Several weeks ago Greenland's [60,000] people

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
voted themselves self-governance rights

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
from Denmark.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
So Denmark is about to get a whole lot smaller.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
What is the lesson from all of this?

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000
Geopolitics is a very unsentimental discipline.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
It's constantly morphing and changing the world,

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
like climate change.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
And like our relationship with the ecosystem

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
we're always searching for equilibrium

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
in how we divide ourselves across the planet.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
Now we fear changes on the map.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
We fear civil wars, death tolls,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
having to learn the names of new countries.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
But I believe that the inertia of the existing borders that we have today

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
is far worse and far more violent.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
The question is how do we change those borders,

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
and what lines do we focus on?

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
I believe we focus on the lines that cross borders,

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
the infrastructure lines.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Then we'll wind up with the world we want, a borderless one.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
Thank you.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000
(Applause)
