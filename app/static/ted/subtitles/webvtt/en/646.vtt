WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'd like to talk a little bit this morning

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
about what happens if we move from design

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
to design thinking.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Now this rather old photo up there

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
is actually the first project I was ever hired to do,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
something like 25 years ago.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It's a woodworking machine, or at least a piece of one,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and my task was to

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
make this thing a little bit more modern,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
a little bit easier to use.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I thought, at the time, I did a pretty good job.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Unfortunately, not very long afterwards

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
the company went out of business.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
This is the second project that I did. It's a fax machine.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I put an attractive shell around some new technology.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Again, 18 months later,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
the product was obsolete.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And now, of course, the whole technology is obsolete.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Now, I'm a fairly slow learner,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
but eventually it occurred to me that

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
maybe what passed for design

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
wasn't all that important --

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
making things more attractive,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
making them a bit easier to use,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
making them more marketable.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
By focusing on a design,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
maybe just a single product,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I was being incremental

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and not having much of an impact.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
But I think this small view of design

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
is a relatively recent phenomenon,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and in fact really emerged

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
in the latter half of the 20th century

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
as design became a tool of consumerism.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
So when we talk about design today,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and particularly when we read about it in the popular press,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
we're often talking about products like these.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Amusing? Yes. Desirable? Maybe.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Important? Not so very.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
But this wasn't always the way.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And I'd like to suggest that if we take

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
a different view of design,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and focus less on the object

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and more on design thinking as an approach,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
that we actually might see the result in a bigger impact.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Now this gentleman, Isambard Kingdom Brunel,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
designed many great things in his career in the 19th century,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
including the Clifton suspension bridge in Bristol

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and the Thames tunnel at Rotherhithe.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Both great designs and actually very innovative too.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
His greatest creation

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
runs actually right through here in Oxford.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
It's called the Great Western Railway.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And as a kid I grew up very close to here,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and one of my favorite things to do

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
was to cycle along by the side of the railway

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
waiting for the great big express trains to roar past.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
You can see it represented here in J.M.W. Turner's painting,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
"Rain, Steam and Speed".

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Now, what Brunel said that he wanted to achieve for his passengers

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
was the experience of floating across the countryside.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Now, this was back in the 19th century.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And to do that meant creating the flattest gradients

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
that had ever yet been made,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
which meant building long viaducts across river valleys --

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
this is actually the viaduct across the Thames at Maidenhead --

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
and long tunnels such as the one at Box, in Wiltshire.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
But he didn't stop there. He didn't stop

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
with just trying to design the best railway journey.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
He imagined an integrated transportation system

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
in which it would be possible for a passenger to embark

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
on a train in London

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
and disembark from a ship in New York.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
One journey from London to New York.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
This is the S.S. Great Western that he built

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
to take care of the second half of that journey.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Now, Brunel was working 100 years before

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
the emergence of the design profession,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
but I think he was using design thinking

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
to solve problems and to create world-changing innovations.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Now, design thinking begins with what Roger Martin,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
the business school professor at the University of Toronto,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
calls integrative thinking.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And that's the ability to exploit opposing ideas

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and opposing constraints

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
to create new solutions.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
In the case of design, that means

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
balancing desirability, what humans need,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
with technical feasibility,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and economic viability.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
With innovations like the Great Western,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
we can stretch that balance to the absolute limit.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.000
So somehow, we went from this to this.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Systems thinkers who were reinventing the world,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
to a priesthood of folks in black turtlenecks and designer glasses

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
working on small things.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
As our industrial society matured,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
so design became a profession

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
and it focused on an ever smaller canvas

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
until it came to stand for aesthetics,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
image and fashion.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Now I'm not trying to throw stones here.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
I'm a fully paid-up member of that priesthood,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
and somewhere in here I have my designer glasses.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
There we go.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
But I do think that perhaps design

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
is getting big again.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
And that's happening through

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
the application of design thinking

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
to new kinds of problems --

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
to global warming, to education,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
healthcare, security, clean water, whatever.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And as we see this reemergence of design thinking

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
and we see it beginning to tackle new kinds of problems,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
there are some basic ideas that I think we can observe that are useful.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
And I'd like to talk about some of those

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
just for the next few minutes.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
The first of those is that design is

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
human-centered.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
It may integrate technology and economics,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
but it starts with what humans need, or might need.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
What makes life easier, more enjoyable?

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
What makes technology useful and usable?

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
But that is more than simply good ergonomics,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
putting the buttons in the right place.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
It's often about understanding culture and context

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
before we even know where to start to have ideas.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
So when a team was working on a new vision screening program in India,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
they wanted to understand what the aspirations

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
and motivations were of these school children

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
to understand how they might play a role

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
in screening their parents.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Conversion Sound has developed a high quality,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
ultra-low-cost digital hearing aid

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
for the developing world.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Now, in the West we rely on highly trained technicians

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
to fit these hearing aids.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
In places like India, those technicians simply don't exist.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
So it took a team working in India

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
with patients and community health workers

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
to understand how a PDA

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
and an application on a PDA

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
might replace those technicians

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
in a fitting and diagnostic service.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Instead of starting with technology,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
the team started with people and culture.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
So if human need is the place to start,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
then design thinking rapidly moves on to

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
learning by making.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Instead of thinking about what to build,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
building in order to think.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Now, prototypes speed up the process of innovation,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
because it is only when we put our ideas out into the world

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
that we really start to understand their strengths and weaknesses.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And the faster we do that,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
the faster our ideas evolve.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Now, much has been said and written about

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
the Aravind Eye Institute in Madurai, India.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
They do an incredible job of serving very poor patients

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
by taking the revenues from those who can afford to pay

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
to cross-subsidize those who cannot.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Now, they are very efficient,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
but they are also very innovative.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
When I visited them a few years ago,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
what really impressed me was their willingness

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
to prototype their ideas very early.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
This is the manufacturing facility

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
for one of their biggest cost breakthroughs.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
They make their own intraocular lenses.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
These are the lenses that replace those

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
that are damaged by cataracts.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And I think it's partly their prototyping mentality

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
that really allowed them to achieve the breakthrough.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Because they brought the cost down

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000
from $200 a pair,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
down to just $4 a pair.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Partly they did this by instead of building

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
a fancy new factory,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
they used the basement of one of their hospitals.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
And instead of installing the large-scale machines

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
used by western producers,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
they used low-cost CAD/CAM prototyping technology.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
They are now the biggest manufacturer of these lenses in the developing world

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
and have recently moved into a custom factory.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
So if human need is the place to start,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
and prototyping, a vehicle for progress,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
then there are also some questions to ask about the destination.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Instead of seeing its primary objective as consumption,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
design thinking is beginning to explore the potential of participation --

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
the shift from a passive relationship

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
between consumer and producer

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
to the active engagement of everyone

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
in experiences that are meaningful,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
productive and profitable.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
So I'd like to take the idea that Rory Sutherland talked about,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
this notion that intangible things are worth perhaps more than physical things,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
and take that a little bit further and say that

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
I think the design of participatory systems,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
in which many more forms of value

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
beyond simply cash

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
are both created and measured,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
is going to be the major theme, not only for design,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
but also for our economy as we go forward.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
So William Beveridge, when he wrote the first of his famous reports in 1942,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
created what became Britain's welfare state

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
in which he hoped that every citizen

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
would be an active participant

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
in their own social well-being.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
By the time he wrote his third report,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
he confessed that he had failed

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.000
and instead had created a society of welfare consumers.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Hilary Cottam, Charlie Leadbeater,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
and Hugo Manassei of Participle

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
have taken this idea of participation,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
and in their manifesto entitled Beveridge 4.0,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
they are suggesting a framework

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
for reinventing the welfare state.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
So in one of their projects called Southwark Circle,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
they worked with residents in Southwark, South London

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
and a small team of designers

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
to develop a new membership organization

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
to help the elderly with household tasks.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Designs were refined and developed

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
with 150 older people and their families

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
before the service was launched earlier this year.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
We can take this idea of participation

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
perhaps to its logical conclusion

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
and say that design may have its greatest impact

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
when it's taken out of the hands of designers

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
and put into the hands of everyone.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Nurses and practitioners at U.S. healthcare system

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
Kaiser Permanente

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
study the topic of improving the patient experience,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000
and particularly focused on the way that they exchange knowledge

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
and change shift.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Through a program of observational research,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
brainstorming new solutions and rapid prototyping,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
they've developed a completely new way to change shift.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
They went from retreating to the nurse's station

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
to discuss the various states and needs of patients,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
to developing a system that happened on the ward

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
in front of patients, using a simple software tool.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
By doing this they brought the time that they were away from patients

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
down from 40 minutes to 12 minutes, on average.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
They increased patient confidence and nurse happiness.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
When you multiply that by all the nurses

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
in all the wards in 40 hospitals in the system,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
it resulted, actually, in a pretty big impact.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
And this is just one of thousands

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000
of opportunities in healthcare alone.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
So these are just some of the kind of basic ideas

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
around design thinking

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
and some of the new kinds of projects

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
that they're being applied to.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
But I'd like to go back to Brunel here,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
and suggest a connection that might explain why this is happening now,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
and maybe why design thinking is a useful tool.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And that connection is change.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
In times of change we need

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
new alternatives, new ideas.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Now, Brunel worked at the height of the Industrial Revolution,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
when all of life and our economy

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
was being reinvented.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Now the industrial systems of Brunel's time have run their course,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
and indeed they are part of the problem today.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
But, again, we are in the midst of massive change.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
And that change is forcing us to question

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
quite fundamental aspects of our society --

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
how we keep ourselves healthy, how we govern ourselves,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
how we educate ourselves, how we keep ourselves secure.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
And in these times of change, we need these new choices

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000
because our existing solutions are simply becoming obsolete.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
So why design thinking?

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Because it gives us a new way of tackling problems.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Instead of defaulting to our normal convergent approach

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
where we make the best choice out of available alternatives,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
it encourages us to take a divergent approach,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
to explore new alternatives, new solutions,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
new ideas that have not existed before.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
But before we go through that process of divergence,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
there is actually quite an important first step.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
And that is, what is the question that we're trying to answer?

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
What's the design brief?

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Now Brunel may have asked a question like this,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000
"How do I take a train from London to New York?"

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
But what are the kinds of questions that we might ask today?

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:42.000
So these are some that we've been asked to think about recently.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
And one in particular, is one that we're working on with the Acumen Fund,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
in a project that's been funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
How might we improve access to safe drinking water

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
for the world's poorest people,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
and at the same time stimulate innovation

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
amongst local water providers?

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
So instead of having a bunch of American designers

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
come up with new ideas that may or may not have been appropriate,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
we took a sort of more open, collaborative and participative approach.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
We teamed designers and investment experts up with

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
11 water organizations across India.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
And through workshops they developed

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
innovative new products, services, and business models.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
We hosted a competition

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
and then funded five of those organizations

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
to develop their ideas.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
So they developed and iterated these ideas.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
And then IDEO and Acumen spent several weeks working with them

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
to help design new social marketing campaigns,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
community outreach strategies, business models,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
new water vessels for storing water

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
and carts for delivering water.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Some of those ideas are just getting launched into the market.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
And the same process is just getting underway

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
with NGOs in East Africa.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
So for me, this project shows

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
kind of how far we can go from

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
some of those sort of small things

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
that I was working on

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
at the beginning of my career.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
That by focusing on the needs of humans

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
and by using prototypes

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
to move ideas along quickly,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
by getting the process out of the hands of designers,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
and by getting the active participation of the community,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
we can tackle bigger and more interesting questions.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
And just like Brunel, by focusing on systems,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
we can have a bigger impact.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
So that's one thing that we've been working on.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
I'm actually really quite interested, and perhaps more interested

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
to know what this community thinks we could work on.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
What kinds of questions do we think

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
design thinking could be used to tackle?

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
And if you've got any ideas

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
then feel free, you can post them to Twitter.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
There is a hash tag there that you can use, #CBDQ.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
And the list looked something like this a little while ago.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
And of course you can search to find the questions that you're interested in

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
by using the same hash code.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
So I'd like to believe that design thinking

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
actually can make a difference,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
that it can help create new ideas

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
and new innovations,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
beyond the latest High Street products.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
To do that I think we have to take a more expansive view of design,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:19.000
more like Brunel, less a domain of a professional priesthood.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
And the first step is to start asking the right questions.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Thank you very much.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000
(Applause)
