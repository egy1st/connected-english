00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
For years I've been feeling frustrated,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
because as a religious historian,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I've become acutely aware

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
of the centrality of compassion

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
in all the major world faiths.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Every single one of them

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
has evolved their own version

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
of what's been called the Golden Rule.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Sometimes it comes in a positive version --

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
"Always treat all others as you'd like to be treated yourself."

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And equally important

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
is the negative version --

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
"Don't do to others what you would not like them to do to you."

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Look into your own heart,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
discover what it is that gives you pain

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and then refuse, under any circumstance whatsoever,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
to inflict that pain on anybody else.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And people have emphasized the importance of compassion,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
not just because it sounds good,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
but because it works.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
People have found that when they have

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
implemented the Golden Rule

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
as Confucius said, "all day and every day,"

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
not just a question of doing your good deed for the day

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and then returning to a life of greed

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and egotism,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
but to do it all day and every day,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
you dethrone yourself from the center of your world,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
put another there, and you transcend yourself.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And it brings you into the presence

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
of what's been called God, Nirvana, Rama, Tao.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Something that goes beyond

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
what we know in our ego-bound existence.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
But you know you'd never know it a lot of the time,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
that this was so central to the religious life.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Because with a few wonderful exceptions,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
very often when religious people come together,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
religious leaders come together, they're arguing about abstruse doctrines

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
or uttering a council of hatred

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
or inveighing against homosexuality or something of that sort.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Often people don't really want to be compassionate.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I sometimes see

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
when I'm speaking to a congregation of religious people

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
a sort of mutinous expression crossing their faces

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
because people often want to be right instead.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
And that of course defeats the object of the exercise.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Now why was I so grateful to TED?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Because they took me very gently

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
from my book-lined study

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and brought me into the 21st century,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
enabling me to speak to a much, much wider audience

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
than I could have ever conceived.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Because I feel an urgency about this.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
If we don't manage to implement

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
the Golden Rule globally,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
so that we treat all peoples, wherever and whoever they may be,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
as though they were as important as ourselves,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I doubt that we'll have

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
a viable world to hand on to the next generation.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
The task of our time,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
one of the great tasks of our time,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
is to build a global society, as I said,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
where people can live together in peace.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
And the religions that should be making a major contribution

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
are instead seen as part of the problem.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And of course it's not just religious people who believe in the Golden Rule.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
This is the source of all morality,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
this imaginative act of empathy,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
putting yourself in the place of another.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And so we have a choice, it seems to me.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
We can either go on bringing out or emphasizing

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
the dogmatic and intolerant aspects of our faith,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
or we can go back to

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
the rabbis. Rabbi Hillel, the older contemporary of Jesus,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
who, when asked by a pagan

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
to sum up the whole of Jewish teaching while he stood on one leg,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
said, "That which is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
That is the Torah and everything else is only commentary."

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
And the rabbis and the early fathers of the church who said that

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
any interpretation of scripture

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
that bred hatred and disdain was illegitimate.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And we need to revive that spirit.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
And it's not just going to happen

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
because a spirit of love wafts us down.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
We have to make this happen,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
and we can do it

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
with the modern communications

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
that TED has introduced.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Already I've been tremendously heartened

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
at the response of all our partners.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
In Singapore, we have a group

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
going to use the Charter to heal divisions

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
recently that have sprung up in Singaporean society,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and some members of the parliament want

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
to implement it politically.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
In Malaysia, there is going to be an art exhibition

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
in which leading artists are going to be

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
taking people, young people,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
and showing them that compassion also lies

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
at the root of all art.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Throughout Europe, the Muslim communities

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
are holding events and discussions,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
are discussing the centrality of compassion

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
in Islam and in all faiths.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
But it can't stop there. It can't stop with the launch.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Religious teaching, this is where we've gone so wrong,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
concentrating solely on believing abstruse doctrines.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Religious teaching must always lead to action.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
And I intend to work on this till my dying day.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And I want to continue with our partners

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
to do two things --

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:13.000
educate and stimulate compassionate thinking.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Education because we've so

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
dropped out of compassion.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
People often think it simply means

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
feeling sorry for somebody.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
But of course you don't understand compassion

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
if you're just going to think about it.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
You also have to do it.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
I want them to get the media involved

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
because the media are crucial

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
in helping to dissolve some of the stereotypical views

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
we have of other people,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
which are dividing us from one another.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
The same applies to educators.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
I'd like youth to get a sense of

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
the dynamism, the dynamic and challenge

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
of a compassionate lifestyle.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
And also see that it demands acute intelligence,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
not just a gooey feeling.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
I'd like to call upon scholars to explore

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
the compassionate theme

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
in their own and in other people's traditions.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
And perhaps above all,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
to encourage a sensitivity about

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
uncompassionate speaking,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
so that because people have this Charter,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
whatever their beliefs or lack of them,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
they feel empowered

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
to challenge uncompassionate speech,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
disdainful remarks

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
from their religious leaders, their political leaders,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
from the captains of industry.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Because we can change the world,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
we have the ability.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
I would never have thought of putting the Charter online.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
I was still stuck in the old world

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
of a whole bunch of boffins sitting together in a room

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
and issuing yet another arcane statement.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
And TED introduced me to a whole new way

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
of thinking and presenting ideas.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Because that is what is so wonderful about TED.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
In this room, all this expertise,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
if we joined it all together,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
we could change the world.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
And of course the problems sometimes seem insuperable.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
But I'd just like to quote, finish at the end

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
with a reference to a British author, an Oxford author

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
whom I don't quote very often,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
C.S. Lewis.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
But he wrote one thing that stuck in my mind

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
ever since I read it when I was a schoolgirl.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
It's in his book "The Four Loves."

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
He said that he distinguished between erotic love,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.000
when two people gaze, spellbound, into each other's eyes.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
And then he compared that to friendship,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
when two people stand side by side, as it were, shoulder to shoulder,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
with their eyes fixed on a common goal.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000
We don't have to fall in love with each other,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
but we can become friends.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
And I am convinced.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
I felt it very strongly

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
during our little deliberations at Vevey,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
that when people of all different persuasions

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
come together, working side by side

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
for a common goal,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
differences melt away.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
And we learn amity.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
And we learn to live together and to get to know one another.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Thank you very much.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000
(Applause)
