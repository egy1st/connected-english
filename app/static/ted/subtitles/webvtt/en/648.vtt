WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I have a very difficult task.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I'm a spectroscopist.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I have to talk about astronomy without showing you

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
any single image of nebulae or galaxies, etc.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
because my job is spectroscopy.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I never deal with images.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
But I'll try to convince you

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
that spectroscopy is actually something which can

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
change this world.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Spectroscopy can probably answer the question,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
"Is there anybody out there?"

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Are we alone? SETI.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It's not very fun to do spectroscopy.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
One of my colleagues in Bulgaria,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Nevena Markova, spent about 20 years

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
studying these profiles.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And she published 42 articles

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
just dedicated to the subject.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Can you imagine? Day and night, thinking,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
observing, the same star for 20 years

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
is incredible.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
But we are crazy. We do these things.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
(Laughter)

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And I'm not that far.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I spent about eight months working on these profiles.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Because I've noticed

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
a very small symmetry

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
in the profile of one of the planet host stars.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And I thought, well maybe there is Lithium-6 in this star,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
which is an indication that this star

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
has swallowed a planet.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Because apparently you can't have this fragile isotope

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
of Lithium-6 in the atmospheres of sun-like stars.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
But you have it in planets and asteroids.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So if you engulf planet or large number of asteroids,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
you will have this Lithium-6 isotope

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
in the spectrum of the star.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So I invested more than eight months

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
just studying the profile of this star.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And actually it's amazing,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
because I got phone calls from many reporters asking,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
"Have you actually seen the planet going into a star?"

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Because they thought that if you are having a telescope,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
you are an astronomer so what you are doing

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
is actually looking in a telescope.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And you might have seen the planet going into a star.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And I was saying, "No, excuse me.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
What I see is this one."

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
(Laughter)

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
It's just incredible. Because nobody understood really.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I bet that there were very few people

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
who really understood what I'm talking about.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Because this is the indication that the planet went into the star.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
It's amazing.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
The power of spectroscopy

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
was actually realized

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
by Pink Floyd already in 1973.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
(Laughter)

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Because they actually said that

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
you can get any color you like

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
in a spectrum.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And all you need is time and money

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
to make your spectrograph.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
This is the number one high resolution,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
most precise spectrograph on this planet, called HARPS,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
which is actually used to detect

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
extrasolar planets and sound waves

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
in the atmospheres of stars.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
How we get spectra?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I'm sure most of you know from school physics

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
that it's basically splitting a white light

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
into colors.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And if you have a liquid hot mass,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
it will produce something which we call a continuous spectrum.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
A hot gas is producing emission lines only,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
no continuum.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And if you place a cool gas in front of a

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
hot source,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
you will see certain patterns

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
which we call absorption lines.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Which is used actually to identify chemical elements

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
in a cool matter,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
which is absorbing exactly at those frequencies.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Now, what we can do with the spectra?

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
We can actually study line-of-sight velocities

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
of cosmic objects.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And we can also study chemical composition

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
and physical parameters of stars,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
galaxies, nebulae.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
A star is the most simple object.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
In the core, we have thermonuclear reactions going on,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
creating chemical elements.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And we have a cool atmosphere.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
It's cool for me.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Cool in my terms is three or four or five thousand degrees.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
My colleagues in infra-red astronomy

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
call minus 200 Kelvin is cool for them.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
But you know, everything is relative.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
So for me 5,000 degrees is pretty cool.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000
(Laughter)

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
This is the spectrum of the Sun --

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
24,000 spectral lines,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
and about 15 percent of these lines is not yet identified.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
It is amazing. So we are in the 21st century,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
and we still cannot properly understand

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
the spectrum of the sun.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Sometimes we have to deal with

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
just one tiny, weak spectral line

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
to measure the composition of that chemical element in the atmosphere.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
For instance, you see the spectral line of the gold

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
is the only spectral line in the spectrum of the Sun.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
And we use this weak feature

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
to measure the composition

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
of gold in the atmosphere of the Sun.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And now this is a work in progress.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
We have been dealing with a similarly very weak feature,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
which belongs to osmium.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
It's a heavy element produced in thermonuclear

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
explosions of supernovae.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
It's the only place where you can produce, actually, osmium.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Just comparing the composition of osmium

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
in one of the planet host stars,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
we want to understand why there is so much

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
of this element.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Perhaps we even think that maybe

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
supernova explosions trigger formations of planets and stars.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
It can be an indication.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
The other day, my colleague from Berkeley,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Gibor Basri, emailed me

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
a very interesting spectrum,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
asking me, "Can you have a look at this?"

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
And I couldn't sleep, next two weeks,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
when I saw the huge amount of oxygen

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
and other elements in the spectrum of the stars.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
I knew that there is nothing like that observed in the galaxy.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
It was incredible. The only conclusion we could make from this

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
is clear evidence that there was a supernova explosion

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
in this system, which polluted the atmosphere

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
of this star.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
And later a black hole was formed

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
in a binary system,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
which is still there with a mass of about

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
five solar masses.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
This was considered as first evidence that actually black holes

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
come from supernovae explosions.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
My colleagues, comparing composition of chemical elements

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
in different galactic stars,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
actually discovered alien stars in our galaxy.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
It's amazing that you can go so far

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
simply studying the chemical composition of stars.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
They actually said that one of the stars you see in the spectra

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
is an alien. It comes from a different galaxy.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
There is interaction of galaxies. We know this.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And sometimes they just capture stars.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
You've heard about solar flares.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
We were very surprised to discover

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
a super flare,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
a flare which is thousands of millions of times

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
more powerful than those we see in the Sun.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
In one of the binary stars in our galaxy

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
called FH Leo,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
we discovered the super flare.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
And later we went to study the spectral stars

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
to see is there anything strange with these objects.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
And we found that everything is normal.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
These stars are normal like the Sun. Age, everything was normal.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
So this is a mystery.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
It's one of the mysteries we still have, super flares.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
And there are six or seven similar cases

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
reported in the literature.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Now to go ahead with this,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
we really need to understand chemical evolution of the universe.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
It's very complicated. I don't really want you to

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
try to understand what is here.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000
(Laughter)

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
But it's to show you how complicated is the whole story

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
of the production of chemical elements.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
You have two channels --

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
the massive stars and low-mass stars --

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
producing and recycling matter and chemical elements in the universe.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
And doing this for 14 billion years,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
we end up with this picture,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
which is a very important graph,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
showing relative abundances of chemical elements

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
in sun-like stars

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
and in the interstellar medium.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
So which means that it's really impossible

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
to find an object where you find about 10 times more sulfur than silicon,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
five times more calcium than oxygen. It's just impossible.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
And if you find one, I will say that

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
this is something related to SETI,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
because naturally you can't do it.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Doppler Effect is something very important

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
from fundamental physics.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
And this is related to the change of the frequency

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
of a moving source.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
The Doppler Effect is used to discover extrasolar planets.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
The precision which we need

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
to discover a Jupiter-like planet

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
around a sun-like star

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
is something like 28.4 meters per second.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
And we need nine centimeters per second

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
to detect an Earth-like planet.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
This can be done with the future spectrographs.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
I, myself, I'm actually involved in the team

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
which is developing a CODEX,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
high resolution, future generation spectrograph

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
for the 42 meter E-ELT telescope.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And this is going to be an instrument

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
to detect Earth-like planets

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
around sun-like stars.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
It is an amazing tool called astroseismology

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
where we can detect sound waves

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
in the atmospheres of stars.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
This is the sound of an Alpha Cen.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
We can detect sound waves

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
in the atmospheres of sun-like stars.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Those waves have frequencies

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
in infrasound domain, the sound actually nobody knows, domain.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Coming back to the most important question,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
"Is there anybody out there?"

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
This is closely related

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
to tectonic and volcanic activity of planets.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Connection between life

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
and radioactive nuclei

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
is straightforward.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
No life without tectonic activity,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
without volcanic activity.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
And we know very well that geothermal energy

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
is mostly produced by decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
How to measure, if we have planets

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
where the amount of those elements is small,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
so those planets are tectonically dead,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
there cannot be life.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
If there is too much uranium or potassium or thorium,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
probably, again, there would be no life.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Because can you imagine everything boiling?

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
It's too much energy on a planet.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Now, we have been measuring abundance

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
of thorium in one of the stars with extrasolar planets.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
It's exactly the same game. A very tiny feature.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
We are actually trying to measure this profile

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
and to detect thorium.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
It's very tough. It's very tough.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
And you have to, first you have to convince yourself.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Then you have to convince your colleagues.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
And then you have to convince the whole world

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
that you have actually detected something like this

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
in the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
host star somewhere in 100 parsec away from here.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
It's really difficult.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
But if you want to know about a life on extrasolar planets,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
you have to do this job.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Because you have to know how much of radioactive element you have

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
in those systems.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
The one way to discover about aliens

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
is to tune your radio telescope and listen to the signals.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
If you receive something interesting,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
well that's what SETI does actually,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
what SETI has been doing for many years.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
I think the most promising way

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
is to go for biomarkers.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
You can see the spectrum of the Earth, this Earthshine spectrum,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
and that is a very clear signal.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
The slope which is coming, which we call a Red Edge,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
is a detection of vegetated area.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
It's amazing that we can detect vegetation

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
from a spectrum.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Now imagine doing this test

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
for other planets.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Now very recently, very recently,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
I'm talking about last six, seven, eight months,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
water, methane, carbon dioxide

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
have been detected in the spectrum

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
of a planet outside the solar system.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
It's amazing. So this is the power of spectroscopy.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
You can actually go and detect

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
and study a chemical composition of planets

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
far, far, far from solar system.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
We have to detect oxygen or ozone

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
to make sure that we have all necessary conditions

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
to have life.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Cosmic miracles are something

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
which can be related to SETI.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Now imagine an object, amazing object,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
or something which we cannot explain

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
when we just stand up and say,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
"Look, we give up. Physics doesn't work."

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
So it's something which you can always refer to SETI and say,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000
"Well, somebody must be doing this, somehow."

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
And with the known physics etc,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
it's something actually which has been pointed out

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
by Frank Drake,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
many years ago, and Shklovsky.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
If you see, in the spectrum of a planet host star,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
if you see strange chemical elements,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
it can be a signal from a civilization

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
which is there and they want to signal about it.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
They want to actually signal their presence

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
through these spectral lines,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
in the spectrum of a star, in different ways.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
There can be different ways doing this.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
One is, for instance, technetium

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
is a radioactive element

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
with a decay time of 4.2 million years.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
If you suddenly observe technetium

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
in a sun-like star,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
you can be sure that somebody has put this

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
element in the atmosphere,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
because in a natural way it is impossible to do this.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Now we are reviewing the spectra of about

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
300 stars with extrasolar planets.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
And we are doing this job since 2000

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
and it's a very heavy project.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
We have been working very hard.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
And we have some interesting cases,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
candidates, so on, things which we can't really explain.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
And I hope in the near future

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
we can confirm this.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
So the main question: "Are we alone?"

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
I think it will not come from UFOs.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
It will not come from radio signals.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
I think it will come from a spectrum like this.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
It is the spectrum of a planet like Earth,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
showing a presence of nitrogen dioxide,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
as a clear signal of life,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
and oxygen and ozone.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
If, one day, and I think it will be

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
within 15 years from now, or 20 years.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
If we discover a spectrum like this

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
we can be sure that there is life on that planet.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
In about five years we will discover

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
planets like Earth, around sun-like stars,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
the same distance as the Earth from the Sun.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
It will take about five years.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
And then we will need another 10, 15 years

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
with space projects

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
to get the spectra of Earth-like planets like the one I showed you.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
And if we see the nitrogen dioxide

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
and oxygen,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
I think we have the perfect E.T.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Thank you very much.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
(Applause)
