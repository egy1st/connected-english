00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I run a design studio in New York.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Every seven years, I close it for one year

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
to pursue

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
some little experiments, things that

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
are always difficult to accomplish

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
during the regular working year.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
In that year, we are not available

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
for any of our clients.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We are totally closed.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And as you can imagine,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
it is a lovely and very energetic time.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I originally had opened the studio in New York

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
to combine my two loves, music and design.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And we created videos and packaging

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
for many musicians that you know,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and for even more that you've never heard of.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
As I realized, just like with many many things in my life

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
that I actually love,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I adapt to it.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And I get, over time, bored by them.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And for sure, in our case,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
our work started to look the same.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
You see here a glass eye in a die cut of a book.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Quite the similar idea, then, a perfume packaged

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
in a book, in a die cut.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So I decided to close it down for one year.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Also is the knowledge that

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
right now we spend about

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
in the first 25 years of our lives learning,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
then there is another 40 years

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
that's really reserved for working.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And then tacked on at the end of it

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
are about 15 years for retirement.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And I thought it might be helpful

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
to basically cut off five of those retirement years

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and intersperse them in between those working years.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
(Applause)

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
That's clearly enjoyable for myself.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
But probably even more important is

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
that the work that comes out of these years

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
flows back into the company

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and into society at large,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000
rather than just benefiting a grandchild or two.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
There is a fellow TEDster who spoke two years ago,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Jonathan Haidt,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
who defined his work into three different levels.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And they rang very true for me.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
I can see my work as a job. I do it for money.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I likely already look forward to the weekend on Thursdays.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And I probably will need a hobby as a leveling mechanism.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
In a career I'm definitely more engaged.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
But at the same time, there will be periods when I think

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
is all that really hard work really worth my while?

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
While in the third one, in the calling,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
very much likely I would do it also

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
if I wouldn't be financially compensated for it.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I am not a religious person myself,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
but I did look for nature.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I had spent my first sabbatical in New York City.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Looked for something different for the second one.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Europe and the U.S. didn't really feel enticing

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
because I knew them too well. So Asia it was.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
The most beautiful landscapes I had seen in Asia

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
were Sri Lanka and Bali.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Sri Lanka still had the civil war going on, so Bali it was.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
It's a wonderful, very craft-oriented society.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
I arrived there in September 2008,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and pretty much started to work right away.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
There is wonderful inspiration coming from the area itself.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
However the first thing that I needed was

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
mosquito repellent typography

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
because they were definitely around heavily.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And then I needed some sort of way

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
to be able to get back to all the wild dogs

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
that surround my house,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and attacked me during my morning walks.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000
So we created this series of 99 portraits on tee shirts.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Every single dog on one tee shirt.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
As a little retaliation

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
with a just ever so slightly menacing message

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000
(Laughter)

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
on the back of the shirt.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
(Laughter)

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Just before I left New York

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
I decided I could actually renovate my studio.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
And then just leave it all to them.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And I don't have to do anything.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
So I looked for furniture.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
And it turned out that

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
all the furniture that I really liked,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
I couldn't afford.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
And all the stuff I could afford, I didn't like.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
So one of the things that we pursued in Bali

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
was pieces of furniture.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
This one, of course, still works with the wild dogs.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
It's not quite finished yet.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
And I think by the time this lamp came about,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
(Laughter)

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
I had finally made peace with those dogs.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
(Laughter)

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Then there is a coffee table. I also did a coffee table.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
It's called Be Here Now.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
It includes 330 compasses.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
And we had custom espresso cups made

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
that hide a magnet inside,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
and make those compasses go crazy,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
always centering on them.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Then this is a fairly talkative, verbose kind of chair.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
I also started meditating for the first time in my life in Bali.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
And at the same time, I'm extremely aware

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
how boring it is to hear about other people's happinesses.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
So I will not really go too far into it.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Many of you will know this TEDster,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Danny Gilbert, whose book, actually,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
I got it through the TED book club.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
I think it took me four years

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
to finally read it, while on sabbatical.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And I was pleased to see

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
that he actually wrote the book while he was on sabbatical.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
And I'll show you a couple of people

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
that did well by pursuing sabbaticals.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
This is Ferran Adria. Many people think

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
he is right now the best chef in the world

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
with his restaurant north of Barcelona, El Bulli.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
His restaurant is open seven months every year.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
He closes it down for five months

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
to experiment with a full kitchen staff.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
His latest numbers are fairly impressive.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
He can seat, throughout the year,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
he can seat 8,000 people.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
And he has 2.2 million requests for reservations.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
If I look at my cycle, seven years, one year sabbatical,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
it's 12.5 percent of my time.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
And if I look at companies that are actually more successful than mine,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
3M since the 1930s

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
is giving all their engineers

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
15 percent to pursue whatever they want.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
There is some good successes.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Scotch tape came out of this program,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
as well as Art Fry developed

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
sticky notes from during his personal time for 3M.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Google, of course, very famously

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
gives 20 percent for their software engineers

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
to pursue their own personal projects.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Anybody in here has actually ever conducted a sabbatical?

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.000
That's about five percent of everybody.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
So I'm not sure if you saw your neighbor putting their hand up.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Talk to them about if it was successful or not.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
I've found that

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
finding out about what I'm going to like in the future,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
my very best way is to talk to people

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
who have actually done it

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
much better than myself envisioning it.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
When I had the idea of doing one,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:02.000
the process was I made the decision and I put it into my daily planner book.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
And then I told as many, many people as I possibly could about it

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
so that there was no way that I could chicken out later on.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
(Laughter)

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
In the beginning, on the first sabbatical,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
it was rather disastrous.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
I had thought that I should do this without any plan,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
that this vacuum of time somehow would

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
be wonderful and enticing

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
for idea generation. It was not.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
I just, without a plan, I just reacted

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
to little requests, not work requests,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
those I all said no to, but other little requests.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Sending mail to Japanese design magazines and things like that.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
So I became my own intern.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
(Laughter)

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
And I very quickly

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
made a list of the things I was interested in,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
put them in a hierarchy, divided them into chunks of time

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
and then made a plan, very much like in grade school.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
What does it say here? Monday, 8 to 9: story writing;

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
9 to 10: future thinking.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Was not very successful. And so on and so forth.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
And that actually, specifically as a starting point

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
of the first sabbatical, worked really well for me.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
What came out of it?

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
I really got close to design again.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
I had fun.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Financially, seen over the long term, it was actually successful.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Because of the improved quality, we could ask for higher prices.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
And probably most importantly,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
basically everything we've done

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
in the seven years following the first sabbatical

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
came out of thinking of that one single year.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
And I'll show you a couple of projects

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
that came out of the seven years following that sabbatical.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
One of the strands of thinking I was involved in was

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
that sameness is so incredibly overrated.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
This whole idea that everything needs to be exactly the same

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
works for a very very few strand of companies,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
and not for everybody else.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
We were asked to design an identity for Casa da Musica,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
the Rem Koolhaas-built music center

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
in Porto, in Portugal.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
And even though I desired to do an identity

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
that doesn't use the architecture,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
I failed at that.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
And mostly also because I realized

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
out of a Rem Koolhaas presentation to the city of Porto, where

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
he talked about a conglomeration of various layers of meaning.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Which I understood after I

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
translated it from architecture speech

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
in to regular English,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
basically as logo making.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
And I understood that the building itself was a logo.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
So then it became quite easy.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
We put a mask on it,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
looked at it deep down in the ground,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
checked it out from all sides,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
west, north, south, east,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
top and bottom.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Colored them in a very particular way

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
by having a friend of mine write a piece of software,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
the Casa da Musica Logo Generator.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
That's connected to a scanner.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
You put any image in there, like that Beethoven image.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
And the software, in a second,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
will give you the Casa da Musica Beethoven logo.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Which, when you actually have to design a Beethoven poster,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
comes in handy, because the visual information of the logo

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
and the actual poster is exactly the same.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
So it will always fit together, conceptually, of course.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
If Zappa's music is performed, it gets its own logo.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Or Philip Glass or Lou Reed or the Chemical Brothers,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
who all performed there, get their own

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Casa da Musica logo.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
It works the same internally with the president or the musical director,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
whose Casa da Musica portraits wind up on their business cards.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
There is a full-blown orchestra

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
living inside the building.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
It has a more transparent identity.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
The truck they go on tour with.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Or there's a smaller contemporary orchestra,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:12.000
12 people that remixes its own title.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
And one of the handy things that came about

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
was that you could take the logo type

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
and create advertising out of it.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Like this Donna Toney poster,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
or Chopin, or Mozart,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
or La Monte Young.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
You can take the shape and make typography out of it.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
You can grow it underneath the skin.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
You can have a poster for a family event in front of the house,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
or a rave underneath the house

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
or a weekly program,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
as well as educational services.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Second insight. So far, until that point I had

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
been mostly involved

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
or used the language of design

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
for promotional purposes,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
which was fine with me.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
On one hand I have nothing against selling.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
My parents are both salespeople.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
But I did feel that

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
I spent so much time learning this language,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
why do I only promote with it?

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
There must be something else.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
And the whole series of work came out of it.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Some of you might have seen it.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
I showed some of it

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
at earlier TEDs before,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
under the title "Things I've Learned in My Life So Far."

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
I'll just show two now.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
This is a whole wall of bananas

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
at different ripenesses

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
on the opening day in this gallery in New York.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
It says, "Self-confidence produces fine results."

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
This is after a week.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
After two weeks,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
three weeks, four weeks, five weeks.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
And you see the self confidence almost comes back,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
but not quite.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
These are some pictures visitors sent to me.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000
(Laughter)

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
And then the city of Amsterdam

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
gave us a plaza and asked us to do something.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
We used the stone plates as a grid

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
for our little piece.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
We got 250,000 coins from the central bank,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
at different darknesses.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
So we got brand new ones, shiny ones,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
medium ones, and very old, dark ones.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
And with the help of 100 volunteers, over a week,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000
created this fairly floral typography

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
that spelled, "Obsessions make my life worse

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
and my work better."

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
And the idea of course was to

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
make the type so precious

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
that as an audience

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
you would be in between,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
"Should I really take as much money as I can?

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Or should I leave the piece intact as it is right now?"

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
While we built all this up

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
during that week, with the 100 volunteers,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
a good number of the neighbors surrounding the plaza

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
got very close to it and quite loved it.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
So when it was finally done,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
and in the first night

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
a guy came with big plastic bags

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000
and scooped up as many coins as he could possibly carry,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
one of the neighbors called the police.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
And the Amsterdam police

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
in all their wisdom,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
came, saw,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
and they wanted to protect the artwork.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
And they swept it all up and put it into custody

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
at police headquarters.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
(Laughter)

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
I think you see, you see them sweeping. You see them sweeping right here.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
That's the police, getting rid of it all.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
So after eight hours

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
that's pretty much all that was left

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
of the whole thing.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
(Laughter)

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
We are also working on the start of a bigger project in Bali.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
It's a movie about happiness.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
And here we asked some nearby pigs

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
to do the titles for us.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
They weren't quite slick enough.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
So we asked the goose to do it again,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
and hoped she would do somehow,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
a more elegant or pretty job.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
And I think she overdid it.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Just a bit too ornamental.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000
And my studio is very close to the monkey forest.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
And the monkeys in that monkey forest

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
looked, actually, fairly happy.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
So we asked those guys to do it again.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
They did a fine job, but had

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000
a couple of readability problems.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
So of course whatever you don't really do yourself

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
doesn't really get done properly.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000
That film we'll be working on for the next two years.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
So it's going to be a while.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
And of course you might think that

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
doing a film on happiness

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
might not really be worthwhile.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Then you can of course always

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
go and see this guy.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Video: (Laughter)

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
And I'm happy I'm alive.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.000
I'm happy I'm alive. I'm happy I'm alive.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Stefan Sagmeister: Thank you.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000
(Applause)
