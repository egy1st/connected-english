WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
What we're really here to talk about is the "how."

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Okay, so how exactly do we create this

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
world-shattering, if you will, innovation?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Now, I want to tell you a quick story.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We'll go back a little more than a year.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
In fact, the date -- I'm curious to know

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
if any of you know what happened on this momentous date?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It was February 3rd, 2008.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Anyone remember what happened,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
February 3rd, 2008?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Super Bowl. I heard it over here. It was the date of the Super Bowl.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And the reason that this date was so momentous

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
is that what my colleagues, John King

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and Halee Fischer-Wright, and I noticed

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
as we began to debrief various Super Bowl parties,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
is that it seemed to us

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
that across the United States,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
if you will, tribal councils had convened.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And they had discussed things of great national importance.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Like, "Do we like the Budweiser commercial?"

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and, "Do we like the nachos?" and, "Who is going to win?"

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
But they also talked about which candidate they were going to support.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And if you go back in time to February 3rd,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
it looked like Hilary Clinton was going to get the Democratic nomination.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And there were even some polls that were saying she was going to go all the way.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
But when we talked to people,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
it appeared that a funnel effect had happened

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
in these tribes all across the United States.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Now what is a tribe? A tribe is a group of

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
about 20 -- so kind of more than a team --

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
20 to about 150 people.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And it's within these tribes that all of our work gets done.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
But not just work. It's within these tribes

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
that societies get built,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
that important things happen.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And so as we surveyed the, if you will, representatives

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
from various tribal councils that met,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
also known as Super Bowl parties,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
we sent the following email off to 40 newspaper editors the following day.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
February 4th, we posted it on our website. This was before Super Tuesday.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
We said, "The tribes that we're in

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
are saying it's going to be Obama."

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Now, the reason we knew that

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
was because we spent the previous 10 years

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
studying tribes, studying these naturally occurring groups.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
All of you are members of tribes.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
In walking around at the break,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
many of you had met members of your tribe. And you were talking to them.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And many of you were doing what great, if you will, tribal leaders do,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
which is to find someone

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
who is a member of a tribe,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
and to find someone else who is another member of a different tribe,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and make introductions.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
That is in fact what great tribal leaders do.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
So here is the bottom line.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
If you focus in on a group like this --

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
this happens to be a USC game --

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and you zoom in with one of those super satellite cameras

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and do magnification factors so you could see individual people,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
you would in fact see not a single crowd,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
just like there is not a single crowd here,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
but you would see these tribes that are then coming together.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And from a distance it appears that it's a single group.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And so people form tribes.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
They always have. They always will.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Just as fish swim and birds fly,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
people form tribes. It's just what we do.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
But here's the rub.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Not all tribes are the same,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and what makes the difference is the culture.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Now here is the net out of this.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
You're all a member of tribes.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
If you can find a way to take the tribes that you're in

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and nudge them forward,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
along these tribal stages

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
to what we call Stage Five, which is the top of the mountain.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
But we're going to start with what we call Stage One.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Now, this is the lowest of the stages.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
You don't want this. Okay?

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
This is a bit of a difficult image to put up on the screen.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
But it's one that I think we need to learn from.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Stage One produces people

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
who do horrible things.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
This is the kid who shot up Virginia Tech.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Stage One is a group where people

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
systematically sever relationships from functional tribes,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and then pool together

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
with people who think like they do.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Stage One is literally the culture of gangs

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
and it is the culture of prisons.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Now, again, we don't often deal with Stage One.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
And I want to make the point

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
that as members of society, we need to.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
It's not enough to simply write people off.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
But let's move on to Stage Two.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Now, Stage One, you'll notice, says, in effect, "Life Sucks."

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
So, this other book that Steve mentioned,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
that just came out, called "The Three Laws of Performance,"

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
my colleague, Steve Zaffron and I,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
argue that as people see the world, so they behave.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Well, if people see the world in such a way that life sucks,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
then their behavior will follow automatically from that.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
It will be despairing hostility.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
They'll do whatever it takes to survive,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
even if that means undermining other people.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Now, my birthday is coming up shortly,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
and my driver's license expires.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
And the reason that that's relevant is that very soon

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
I will be walking into what we call

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
a Stage Two tribe,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
which looks like this.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000
(Laughter)

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Now, am I saying that in every Department of Motor Vehicles

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
across the land, you find a Stage Two culture?

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
No. But in the one near me,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
where I have to go in just a few days,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
what I will say when I'm standing in line is,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
"How can people be so dumb, and yet live?"

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
(Laughter)

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Now, am I saying that there are dumb people working here?

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Actually, no, I'm not.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
But I'm saying the culture makes people dumb.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
So in a Stage Two culture --

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
and we find these in all sorts of different places --

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
you find them, in fact, in the best organizations in the world.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
You find them in all places in society.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
I've come across them at the organizations

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
that everybody raves about as being best in class.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
But here is the point. If you believe and you say

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
to people in your tribe, in effect,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
"My life sucks.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
I mean, if I got to go to TEDx USC

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
my life wouldn't suck. But I don't. So it does."

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
If that's how you talked, imagine what kind of work would get done.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
What kind of innovation would get done?

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
The amount of world-changing behavior that would happen?

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
In fact it would be basically nil.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Now when we go on to Stage Three: this is the one

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
that hits closest to home for many of us.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Because it is in Stage Three that many of us move.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
And we park. And we stay.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Stage Three says, "I'm great. And you're not."

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000
(Laughter)

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
I'm great and you're not.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Now imagine having a whole room of people

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
saying, in effect, "I'm great and you're not."

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Or, "I'm going to find some way to compete with you

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
and come out on top as a result of that."

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
A whole group of people communicating that way, talking that way.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
I know this sounds like a joke. Three doctors walk into a bar.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
But, in this case, three doctors walk into an elevator.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
I happened to be in the elevator collecting data for this book.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And one doctor said to the others, "Did you see my article

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
in the New England Journal of Medicine?"

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
And the other said, "No. That's great. Congratulations!"

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
The next one got kind of a wry smile on his face and said,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
"Well while you were, you know, doing your research," --

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
notice the condescending tone --

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
"While you were off doing your research, I was off doing more surgeries

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
than anyone else in the department of surgery at this institution."

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
And the third one got the same wry smile and said,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
"Well, while you were off doing your research,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
and you were off doing your monkey meatball surgery,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
that eventually we'll train monkeys to do,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
or cells or robots, or maybe not even need to do it at all,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
I was off running the future of the residency program,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
which is really the future of medicine."

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And they all kind of laughed and they patted him on the back.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
And the elevator door opened, and they all walked out.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
That is a meeting of a Stage Three tribe.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Now, we find these in places

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
where really smart, successful people show up.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Like, oh, I don't know, TEDx USC.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000
(Laughter)

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Here is the greatest challenge we face in innovation.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
It is moving from Stage Three

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
to Stage Four.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Let's take a look at a quick video snippet.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
This is from a company called Zappos, located outside Las Vegas.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And my question on the other side is just going to be,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
"What do you think they value?"

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
It was not Christmas time. There was a Christmas tree.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
This is their lobby.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Employees volunteer time in the advice booth.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Notice it looks like something out of a Peanuts cartoon.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Okay, we're going through the hallway here at Zappos.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
This is a call center. Notice how it's decorated.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Notice people are applauding for us.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
They don't know who we are and they don't care. And if they did

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
they probably wouldn't applaud.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
But you'll notice the level of excitement.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Notice, again, how they decorate their office.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Now, what's important to people at Zappos,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
these may not be the things that are important to you.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
But they value things like fun. And they value creativity.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
One of their stated values is, "Be a little bit weird."

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
And you'll notice they are a little bit weird.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
So when individuals come together

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
and find something that unites them

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
that's greater than their individual competence,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
then something very important happens.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
The group gels. And it changes

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
from a group of highly motivated

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
but fairly individually-centric people

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
into something larger,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
into a tribe that becomes aware of its own existence.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Stage Four tribes can do remarkable things.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
But you'll notice we're not at the top of the mountain yet.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
There is, in fact, another stage.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Now, some of you may not recognize the scene that's up here.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
And if you take a look at the headline of Stage Five, which is "Life is Great,"

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
this may seem a little incongruous.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
This is a scene or snippet

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
from the Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
for which Desmond Tutu won the Nobel Prize.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Now think about that. South Africa,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
terrible atrocities had happened in the society.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
And people came together

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
focused only on those two values: truth and reconciliation.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
There was no road map. No one had ever done

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
anything like this before.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
And in this atmosphere, where the only guidance

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
was people's values and their noble cause,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
what this group accomplished was historic.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
And people, at the time, feared that South Africa

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
would end up going the way that Rwanda has gone,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
descending into one skirmish after another

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
in a civil war that seems to have no end.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
In fact, South Africa has not gone down that road.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Largely because people like Desmond Tutu

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
set up a Stage Five process

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
to involve the thousands and perhaps millions

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
of tribes in the country, to bring everyone together.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
So, people hear this and they conclude the following,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
as did we in doing the study.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Okay, got it. I don't want to talk Stage One.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
That's like, you know, "Life sucks." Who wants to talk that way?

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
I don't want to talk like they do

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
at the particular DMV that's close to where Dave lives.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
I really don't want to just say "I'm great,"

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
because that kind of sounds narcissistic, and then I won't have any friends.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Saying, "We're great" -- that sounds pretty good.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
But I should really talk Stage Five, right? "Life is great."

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Well, in fact, there are three somewhat counter-intuitive findings

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
that come out of all this.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
The first one, if you look at the Declaration of Independence

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
and actually read it,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
the phrase that sticks in many of our minds

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
is things about inalienable rights.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
I mean, that's Stage Five, right? Life is great,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
oriented only by our values,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
no other guidance.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
In fact, most of the document is written at Stage Two.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
"My life sucks because I live under a tyrant,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
also known as King George.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
We're great! Who is not great? England!"

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Sorry. (Laughter)

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Well, what about other great leaders? What about Gandhi?

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
What about Martin Luther King?

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
I mean, surely these were just people who preached, "Life is great," right?

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Just one little bit of happiness and joy after another.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
In fact, Martin Luther King's most famous line was at Stage Three.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
He didn't say "We have a dream." He said, "I have a dream."

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Why did he do that? Because most people

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
are not at Stage Five.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Two percent are at Stage One.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
About 25 percent are at Stage Two,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
saying, in effect, "My life sucks."

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
48 percent of working tribes say, these are employed tribes,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
say, "I'm great and you're not."

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
And we have to duke it out every day, so we resort to politics.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Only about 22 percent of tribes

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
are at Stage Four,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
oriented by our values, saying "We're great.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
And our values are beginning to unite us."

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Only two percent, only two percent of tribes

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
get to Stage Five.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
And those are the ones that change the world.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
So the first little finding from this

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
is that leaders need to be able to talk all the levels

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
so that you can touch every person in society.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
But you don't leave them where you found them. Okay?

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Tribes can only hear one level above and below where they are.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
So we have to have the ability to talk

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
all the levels, to go to where they are.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
And then leaders nudge people

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
within their tribes to the next level.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
I'd like to show you some examples of this.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
One of the people we interviewed was Frank Jordan,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
former Mayor of San Francisco. Before that

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
he was Chief of Police in San Francisco.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
And he grew up essentially in Stage One.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
And you know what changed his life? It was walking into

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
one of these, a Boys and Girls Club.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Now here is what happened to this person

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
who eventually became Mayor of San Francisco.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
He went from being alive and passionate

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
at Stage One -- remember, "Life sucks,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
despairing hostility, I will do whatever it takes to survive" --

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
to walking into a Boys and Girls Club,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
folding his arms, sitting down in a chair,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
and saying, "Wow. My life really sucks.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
I don't know anybody.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
I mean, if I was into boxing, like they were,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
then my life wouldn't suck. But I don't. So it does.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
So I'm going to sit here in my chair and not do anything."

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
In fact, that's progress.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
We move people from Stage One to Stage Two

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
by getting them in a new tribe

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
and then, over time, getting them connected.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
So, what about moving

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
from Stage Three to Stage Four?

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
I want to argue that we're doing that right here.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
TED represents a set of values,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
and as we unite around these values,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
something really interesting begins to emerge.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
If you want this experience to live on

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
as something historic,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
then at the reception tonight I'd like to encourage you to do something

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
beyond what people normally do

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
and call networking.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Which is not just to meet new people

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
and extend your reach, extend your influence,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
but instead, find someone you don't know,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
and find someone else you don't know,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
and introduce them.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
That's called a triadic relationship.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
See, people who build world-changing tribes do that.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
They extend the reach of their tribes

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
by connecting them, not just to myself,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
so that my following is greater,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
but I connect people who don't know each other

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
to something greater than themselves.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
And ultimately that adds to their values.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
But we're not done yet. Because then how do we go from Stage Four,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
which is great, to Stage Five?

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
The story that I like to end with is this. It comes out of

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
a place called the Gallup Organization.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
You know they do polls, right?

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
So it's Stage Four. We're great. Who is not great?

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Pretty much everybody else who does polls.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
If Gallup releases a poll on the same day that NBC releases a poll,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
people will pay attention to the Gallup poll. Okay, we understand that.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
So, they were bored.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
They wanted to change the world. So here is the question someone asked.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
"How could we,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
instead of just polling what Asia thinks

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
or what the United States thinks,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
or who thinks what about Obama

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
versus McCain or something like that,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
what does the entire world think?"

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
And they found a way to do the first-ever world poll.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
They had people involved who were Nobel laureates

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
in economics, who reported being bored.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
And suddenly they pulled out sheets of paper

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
and were trying to figure out, "How do we survey the population

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
of Sub-Saharan Africa?

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
How do we survey populations that don't have access to technology,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
and speak languages we don't speak,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
and we don't know anyone who speaks those languages. Because in order

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
to achieve on this great mission,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
we have to be able to do it.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Incidentally, they did pull it off.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
And they released the first-ever world poll.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
So I'd like to leave you with these thoughts.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
First of all: we all form tribes, all of us.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
You're in tribes here. Hopefully you're extending the reach

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
of the tribes that you have.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
But the question on the table is this:

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
What kind of an impact are the tribes

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
that you are in making?

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
You're hearing one presentation after another,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
often representing a group of people, a tribe,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
about how they have changed the world.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
If you do what we've talked about, you listen

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
for how people actually communicate in the tribes that you're in.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
And you don't leave them where they are. You nudge them forward.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
You remember to talk all five culture stages.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Because we've got people in all five, around us.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
And the question that I'd like to leave you with is this:

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Will your tribes change the world?

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Thank you very much.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
(Applause)
