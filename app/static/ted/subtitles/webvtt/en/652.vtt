WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.976
I'm a storyteller.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.976
And I would like to tell you
a few personal stories

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.976
about what I like to call
"the danger of the single story."

00:00:10.746 --> 00:00:13.976
I grew up on a university campus
in eastern Nigeria.

00:00:14.158 --> 00:00:17.467
My mother says that I started
reading at the age of two,

00:00:17.491 --> 00:00:20.507
although I think four
is probably close to the truth.

00:00:21.753 --> 00:00:23.564
So I was an early reader,

00:00:23.588 --> 00:00:26.976
and what I read were British
and American children's books.

00:00:27.706 --> 00:00:29.976
I was also an early writer,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.976
and when I began to write,
at about the age of seven,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.048
stories in pencil
with crayon illustrations

00:00:36.072 --> 00:00:39.604
that my poor mother was obligated to read,

00:00:39.628 --> 00:00:43.196
I wrote exactly the kinds
of stories I was reading:

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.976
All my characters were
white and blue-eyed,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.307
they played in the snow,

00:00:50.331 --> 00:00:52.418
they ate apples,

00:00:52.442 --> 00:00:53.839
(Laughter)

00:00:54.013 --> 00:00:56.024
and they talked a lot about the weather,

00:00:56.048 --> 00:00:58.176
how lovely it was
that the sun had come out.

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:00.373
(Laughter)

00:01:00.397 --> 00:01:03.531
Now, this despite the fact
that I lived in Nigeria.

00:01:03.555 --> 00:01:05.333
I had never been outside Nigeria.

00:01:07.143 --> 00:01:10.404
We didn't have snow, we ate mangoes,

00:01:10.428 --> 00:01:12.276
and we never talked about the weather,

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.976
because there was no need to.

00:01:14.269 --> 00:01:16.976
My characters also drank
a lot of ginger beer,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.381
because the characters
in the British books I read

00:01:19.405 --> 00:01:20.976
drank ginger beer.

00:01:21.301 --> 00:01:23.976
Never mind that I had no idea
what ginger beer was.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.531
(Laughter)

00:01:25.555 --> 00:01:27.005
And for many years afterwards,

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:29.976
I would have a desperate desire
to taste ginger beer.

00:01:30.476 --> 00:01:31.976
But that is another story.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.483
What this demonstrates, I think,

00:01:34.507 --> 00:01:37.361
is how impressionable
and vulnerable we are

00:01:37.385 --> 00:01:38.976
in the face of a story,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.385
particularly as children.

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:45.409
Because all I had read were books
in which characters were foreign,

00:01:45.433 --> 00:01:47.552
I had become convinced that books

00:01:47.576 --> 00:01:50.746
by their very nature
had to have foreigners in them

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.489
and had to be about things with which
I could not personally identify.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.219
Now, things changed
when I discovered African books.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.976
There weren't many of them available,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.869
and they weren't quite as easy to find
as the foreign books.

00:02:03.893 --> 00:02:06.976
But because of writers like
Chinua Achebe and Camara Laye,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.976
I went through a mental shift
in my perception of literature.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.214
I realized that people like me,

00:02:13.238 --> 00:02:15.245
girls with skin the color of chocolate,

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.531
whose kinky hair could not form ponytails,

00:02:18.555 --> 00:02:20.365
could also exist in literature.

00:02:20.682 --> 00:02:23.976
I started to write
about things I recognized.

00:02:24.737 --> 00:02:27.976
Now, I loved those
American and British books I read.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.976
They stirred my imagination.
They opened up new worlds for me.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.976
But the unintended consequence

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.048
was that I did not know
that people like me

00:02:36.072 --> 00:02:37.498
could exist in literature.

00:02:38.451 --> 00:02:41.976
So what the discovery of African writers
did for me was this:

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.877
It saved me from having a single story
of what books are.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.976
I come from a conventional,
middle-class Nigerian family.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.976
My father was a professor.

00:02:52.385 --> 00:02:54.068
My mother was an administrator.

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:58.171
And so we had, as was the norm,

00:02:58.195 --> 00:03:02.544
live-in domestic help, who would often
come from nearby rural villages.

00:03:03.182 --> 00:03:06.468
So, the year I turned eight,
we got a new house boy.

00:03:07.102 --> 00:03:08.356
His name was Fide.

00:03:09.658 --> 00:03:13.959
The only thing my mother told us about him
was that his family was very poor.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.976
My mother sent yams and rice,
and our old clothes, to his family.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.620
And when I didn't finish my dinner,
my mother would say,

00:03:22.644 --> 00:03:26.976
"Finish your food! Don't you know?
People like Fide's family have nothing."

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.976
So I felt enormous pity for Fide's family.

00:03:31.576 --> 00:03:34.473
Then one Saturday,
we went to his village to visit,

00:03:34.497 --> 00:03:37.976
and his mother showed us
a beautifully patterned basket

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.976
made of dyed raffia
that his brother had made.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.976
I was startled.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.976
It had not occurred to me
that anybody in his family

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.976
could actually make something.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.976
All I had heard about them
was how poor they were,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.467
so that it had become impossible for me
to see them as anything else but poor.

00:03:57.143 --> 00:03:59.514
Their poverty was my single story of them.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.524
Years later, I thought about this
when I left Nigeria

00:04:03.548 --> 00:04:06.230
to go to university in the United States.

00:04:06.341 --> 00:04:07.674
I was 19.

00:04:08.421 --> 00:04:11.198
My American roommate was shocked by me.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.586
She asked where I had learned
to speak English so well,

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.698
and was confused when I said that Nigeria

00:04:17.722 --> 00:04:20.436
happened to have English
as its official language.

00:04:21.753 --> 00:04:25.976
She asked if she could listen
to what she called my "tribal music,"

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.976
and was consequently very disappointed

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.976
when I produced my tape of Mariah Carey.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.976
(Laughter)

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.693
She assumed that I did not know
how to use a stove.

00:04:37.782 --> 00:04:39.038
What struck me was this:

00:04:39.062 --> 00:04:42.137
She had felt sorry for me
even before she saw me.

00:04:42.528 --> 00:04:45.976
Her default position
toward me, as an African,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.036
was a kind of patronizing,
well-meaning pity.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.496
My roommate had a single story of Africa:

00:04:53.623 --> 00:04:55.977
a single story of catastrophe.

00:04:56.412 --> 00:04:57.698
In this single story,

00:04:57.722 --> 00:05:01.976
there was no possibility of Africans
being similar to her in any way,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.976
no possibility of feelings
more complex than pity,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.976
no possibility of a connection
as human equals.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.123
I must say that before I went to the U.S.,

00:05:11.147 --> 00:05:13.428
I didn't consciously identify as African.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.976
But in the U.S., whenever Africa came up,
people turned to me.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.746
Never mind that I knew nothing
about places like Namibia.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.096
But I did come to embrace
this new identity,

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.976
and in many ways I think
of myself now as African.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.976
Although I still get quite irritable
when Africa is referred to as a country,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.976
the most recent example being
my otherwise wonderful flight

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.285
from Lagos two days ago,

00:05:35.309 --> 00:05:38.191
in which there was an announcement
on the Virgin flight

00:05:38.215 --> 00:05:42.976
about the charity work in "India,
Africa and other countries."

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.317
(Laughter)

00:05:44.476 --> 00:05:47.976
So, after I had spent some years
in the U.S. as an African,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.174
I began to understand
my roommate's response to me.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.025
If I had not grown up in Nigeria,

00:05:54.049 --> 00:05:57.190
and if all I knew about Africa
were from popular images,

00:05:57.214 --> 00:06:02.386
I too would think that Africa
was a place of beautiful landscapes,

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:03.976
beautiful animals,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.976
and incomprehensible people,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.631
fighting senseless wars,
dying of poverty and AIDS,

00:06:09.655 --> 00:06:11.976
unable to speak for themselves

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.155
and waiting to be saved
by a kind, white foreigner.

00:06:16.928 --> 00:06:19.097
I would see Africans
in the same way that I,

00:06:19.121 --> 00:06:21.824
as a child, had seen Fide's family.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.976
This single story of Africa ultimately
comes, I think, from Western literature.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.976
Now, here is a quote from the writing
of a London merchant called John Lok,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.976
who sailed to west Africa in 1561

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.663
and kept a fascinating
account of his voyage.

00:06:40.203 --> 00:06:43.976
After referring to the black Africans
as "beasts who have no houses,"

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.976
he writes, "They are also
people without heads,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.968
having their mouth and eyes
in their breasts."

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.096
Now, I've laughed
every time I've read this.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.500
And one must admire
the imagination of John Lok.

00:06:59.373 --> 00:07:01.239
But what is important about his writing

00:07:01.263 --> 00:07:02.976
is that it represents the beginning

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.976
of a tradition of telling
African stories in the West:

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.367
A tradition of Sub-Saharan Africa
as a place of negatives,

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:11.634
of difference, of darkness,

00:07:11.658 --> 00:07:16.976
of people who, in the words
of the wonderful poet Rudyard Kipling,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.941
are "half devil, half child."

00:07:20.211 --> 00:07:22.976
And so, I began to realize
that my American roommate

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.976
must have throughout her life

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.976
seen and heard different versions
of this single story,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.976
as had a professor,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.766
who once told me that my novel
was not "authentically African."

00:07:35.869 --> 00:07:37.560
Now, I was quite willing to contend

00:07:37.584 --> 00:07:40.679
that there were a number of things
wrong with the novel,

00:07:40.703 --> 00:07:43.976
that it had failed in a number of places,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.239
but I had not quite imagined
that it had failed

00:07:46.263 --> 00:07:48.976
at achieving something
called African authenticity.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.706
In fact, I did not know
what African authenticity was.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.396
The professor told me that my characters
were too much like him,

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:00.396
an educated and middle-class man.

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:02.522
My characters drove cars.

00:08:02.546 --> 00:08:04.976
They were not starving.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.927
Therefore they were not
authentically African.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.976
But I must quickly add
that I too am just as guilty

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.070
in the question of the single story.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.991
A few years ago,
I visited Mexico from the U.S.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.667
The political climate in the U.S.
at the time was tense,

00:08:21.691 --> 00:08:24.976
and there were debates going on
about immigration.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.976
And, as often happens in America,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.976
immigration became
synonymous with Mexicans.

00:08:30.698 --> 00:08:32.631
There were endless stories of Mexicans

00:08:32.655 --> 00:08:35.976
as people who were
fleecing the healthcare system,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.976
sneaking across the border,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.465
being arrested at the border,
that sort of thing.

00:08:42.163 --> 00:08:45.976
I remember walking around
on my first day in Guadalajara,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.976
watching the people going to work,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.976
rolling up tortillas in the marketplace,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.973
smoking, laughing.

00:08:53.195 --> 00:08:55.976
I remember first feeling slight surprise.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.976
And then, I was overwhelmed with shame.

00:08:59.341 --> 00:09:03.976
I realized that I had been so immersed
in the media coverage of Mexicans

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
that they had become one thing in my mind,

00:09:06.024 --> 00:09:07.849
the abject immigrant.

00:09:08.769 --> 00:09:11.191
I had bought into
the single story of Mexicans

00:09:11.215 --> 00:09:13.722
and I could not have
been more ashamed of myself.

00:09:14.071 --> 00:09:16.618
So that is how to create a single story,

00:09:16.642 --> 00:09:18.976
show a people as one thing,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.976
as only one thing,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.976
over and over again,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.515
and that is what they become.

00:09:25.793 --> 00:09:28.239
It is impossible to talk
about the single story

00:09:28.263 --> 00:09:29.952
without talking about power.

00:09:31.496 --> 00:09:33.244
There is a word, an Igbo word,

00:09:33.268 --> 00:09:36.919
that I think about whenever I think about
the power structures of the world,

00:09:36.943 --> 00:09:38.133
and it is "nkali."

00:09:38.332 --> 00:09:42.976
It's a noun that loosely translates
to "to be greater than another."

00:09:43.554 --> 00:09:46.482
Like our economic and political worlds,

00:09:46.506 --> 00:09:50.976
stories too are defined
by the principle of nkali:

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.976
How they are told, who tells them,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.237
when they're told,
how many stories are told,

00:09:56.261 --> 00:09:58.468
are really dependent on power.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.143
Power is the ability not just to tell
the story of another person,

00:10:03.167 --> 00:10:06.976
but to make it the definitive
story of that person.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.096
The Palestinian poet
Mourid Barghouti writes

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.976
that if you want to dispossess a people,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.976
the simplest way to do it
is to tell their story

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.230
and to start with, "secondly."

00:10:18.484 --> 00:10:22.382
Start the story with the arrows
of the Native Americans,

00:10:22.406 --> 00:10:24.976
and not with the arrival of the British,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.977
and you have an entirely different story.

00:10:28.001 --> 00:10:32.433
Start the story with
the failure of the African state,

00:10:32.457 --> 00:10:35.976
and not with the colonial
creation of the African state,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.742
and you have an entirely different story.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.976
I recently spoke at a university

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.785
where a student told me
that it was such a shame

00:10:45.809 --> 00:10:48.928
that Nigerian men were physical abusers

00:10:48.952 --> 00:10:50.896
like the father character in my novel.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.976
I told him that I had just read a novel
called "American Psycho" --

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.976
(Laughter)

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.976
-- and that it was such a shame

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.976
that young Americans
were serial murderers.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.976
(Laughter)

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.976
(Applause)

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.976
Now, obviously I said this
in a fit of mild irritation.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.976
(Laughter)

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.191
But it would never have
occurred to me to think

00:11:20.215 --> 00:11:23.976
that just because I had read a novel
in which a character was a serial killer

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.976
that he was somehow
representative of all Americans.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.976
This is not because I am
a better person than that student,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.976
but because of America's cultural
and economic power,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.976
I had many stories of America.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.976
I had read Tyler and Updike
and Steinbeck and Gaitskill.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.560
I did not have a single story of America.

00:11:43.671 --> 00:11:45.377
When I learned, some years ago,

00:11:45.401 --> 00:11:49.742
that writers were expected
to have had really unhappy childhoods

00:11:49.766 --> 00:11:51.976
to be successful,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
I began to think about how I could invent
horrible things my parents had done to me.

00:11:56.024 --> 00:11:57.976
(Laughter)

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.976
But the truth is that I had
a very happy childhood,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.976
full of laughter and love,
in a very close-knit family.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.211
But I also had grandfathers
who died in refugee camps.

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:12.976
My cousin Polle died because
he could not get adequate healthcare.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.976
One of my closest friends,
Okoloma, died in a plane crash

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.976
because our fire trucks
did not have water.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.976
I grew up under repressive
military governments

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.976
that devalued education,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.976
so that sometimes, my parents
were not paid their salaries.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.977
And so, as a child, I saw jam
disappear from the breakfast table,

00:12:31.001 --> 00:12:33.498
then margarine disappeared,

00:12:33.522 --> 00:12:35.976
then bread became too expensive,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.871
then milk became rationed.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.657
And most of all, a kind
of normalized political fear

00:12:42.681 --> 00:12:44.363
invaded our lives.

00:12:45.823 --> 00:12:47.960
All of these stories make me who I am.

00:12:48.457 --> 00:12:51.976
But to insist on only
these negative stories

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.976
is to flatten my experience

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.664
and to overlook the many other
stories that formed me.

00:12:59.394 --> 00:13:01.976
The single story creates stereotypes,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.976
and the problem with stereotypes
is not that they are untrue,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.976
but that they are incomplete.

00:13:09.357 --> 00:13:11.960
They make one story become the only story.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.572
Of course, Africa is a continent
full of catastrophes:

00:13:15.596 --> 00:13:18.976
There are immense ones,
such as the horrific rapes in Congo

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.626
and depressing ones,

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:25.150
such as the fact that 5,000 people apply
for one job vacancy in Nigeria.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.563
But there are other stories
that are not about catastrophe,

00:13:29.587 --> 00:13:32.976
and it is very important, it is just
as important, to talk about them.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.976
I've always felt that it is impossible

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.976
to engage properly
with a place or a person

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.976
without engaging with all of the stories
of that place and that person.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.580
The consequence
of the single story is this:

00:13:45.604 --> 00:13:47.561
It robs people of dignity.

00:13:48.332 --> 00:13:51.976
It makes our recognition
of our equal humanity difficult.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.164
It emphasizes how we are different
rather than how we are similar.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.489
So what if before my Mexican trip,

00:13:59.513 --> 00:14:02.976
I had followed the immigration
debate from both sides,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.976
the U.S. and the Mexican?

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.976
What if my mother had told us
that Fide's family was poor

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.976
and hardworking?

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.096
What if we had an African
television network

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:16.976
that broadcast diverse
African stories all over the world?

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.331
What the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe
calls "a balance of stories."

00:14:21.355 --> 00:14:25.331
What if my roommate knew
about my Nigerian publisher,

00:14:25.355 --> 00:14:26.976
Muhtar Bakare,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.048
a remarkable man who left
his job in a bank

00:14:29.072 --> 00:14:31.977
to follow his dream
and start a publishing house?

00:14:32.001 --> 00:14:35.688
Now, the conventional wisdom
was that Nigerians don't read literature.

00:14:35.712 --> 00:14:36.966
He disagreed.

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:40.076
He felt that people
who could read, would read,

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:43.976
if you made literature affordable
and available to them.

00:14:44.666 --> 00:14:46.976
Shortly after he published my first novel,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.976
I went to a TV station
in Lagos to do an interview,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.191
and a woman who worked there
as a messenger came up to me and said,

00:14:53.215 --> 00:14:55.976
"I really liked your novel.
I didn't like the ending.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.239
Now, you must write a sequel,
and this is what will happen ..."

00:14:59.263 --> 00:15:01.977
(Laughter)

00:15:02.001 --> 00:15:04.977
And she went on to tell me
what to write in the sequel.

00:15:05.564 --> 00:15:07.976
I was not only charmed, I was very moved.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.976
Here was a woman, part of the ordinary
masses of Nigerians,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.003
who were not supposed to be readers.

00:15:13.901 --> 00:15:15.525
She had not only read the book,

00:15:15.549 --> 00:15:17.358
but she had taken ownership of it

00:15:17.382 --> 00:15:20.485
and felt justified in telling me
what to write in the sequel.

00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:24.976
Now, what if my roommate knew
about my friend Funmi Iyanda,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.976
a fearless woman who hosts
a TV show in Lagos,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
and is determined to tell the stories
that we prefer to forget?

00:15:31.695 --> 00:15:34.976
What if my roommate knew
about the heart procedure

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.976
that was performed in the Lagos
hospital last week?

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.976
What if my roommate knew
about contemporary Nigerian music,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.976
talented people singing
in English and Pidgin,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.976
and Igbo and Yoruba and Ijo,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.976
mixing influences from Jay-Z to Fela

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.182
to Bob Marley to their grandfathers.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.239
What if my roommate knew
about the female lawyer

00:15:56.263 --> 00:15:59.976
who recently went to court in Nigeria
to challenge a ridiculous law

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.976
that required women to get
their husband's consent

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.976
before renewing their passports?

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.976
What if my roommate knew about Nollywood,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.380
full of innovative people making
films despite great technical odds,

00:16:13.404 --> 00:16:14.976
films so popular

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.976
that they really are the best example
of Nigerians consuming what they produce?

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.286
What if my roommate knew about
my wonderfully ambitious hair braider,

00:16:23.310 --> 00:16:26.976
who has just started her own business
selling hair extensions?

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.976
Or about the millions of other Nigerians
who start businesses and sometimes fail,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.938
but continue to nurse ambition?

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.976
Every time I am home I am confronted

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.976
with the usual sources of irritation
for most Nigerians:

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.444
our failed infrastructure,
our failed government,

00:16:43.468 --> 00:16:45.523
but also by the incredible resilience

00:16:45.547 --> 00:16:48.976
of people who thrive
despite the government,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.261
rather than because of it.

00:16:51.373 --> 00:16:53.976
I teach writing workshops
in Lagos every summer,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.976
and it is amazing to me
how many people apply,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.976
how many people are eager to write,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.386
to tell stories.

00:17:02.275 --> 00:17:05.298
My Nigerian publisher and I
have just started a non-profit

00:17:05.322 --> 00:17:06.976
called Farafina Trust,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.976
and we have big dreams
of building libraries

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.143
and refurbishing libraries
that already exist

00:17:12.167 --> 00:17:14.976
and providing books for state schools

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.096
that don't have anything
in their libraries,

00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:19.501
and also of organizing lots
and lots of workshops,

00:17:19.525 --> 00:17:20.976
in reading and writing,

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.199
for all the people who are eager
to tell our many stories.

00:17:24.326 --> 00:17:25.976
Stories matter.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.976
Many stories matter.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.976
Stories have been used
to dispossess and to malign,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.976
but stories can also be used
to empower and to humanize.

00:17:36.642 --> 00:17:38.976
Stories can break the dignity of a people,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.703
but stories can also repair
that broken dignity.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.048
The American writer
Alice Walker wrote this

00:17:46.072 --> 00:17:49.976
about her Southern relatives
who had moved to the North.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.976
She introduced them to a book about

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.068
the Southern life
that they had left behind.

00:17:55.592 --> 00:17:58.976
"They sat around,
reading the book themselves,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.528
listening to me read the book,
and a kind of paradise was regained."

00:18:05.579 --> 00:18:08.441
I would like to end with this thought:

00:18:08.465 --> 00:18:10.976
That when we reject the single story,

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.976
when we realize that
there is never a single story

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.441
about any place,

00:18:16.465 --> 00:18:17.976
we regain a kind of paradise.

00:18:18.695 --> 00:18:19.817
Thank you.

00:18:19.841 --> 00:18:22.841
(Applause)
