WEBVTT

00:00:01.365 --> 00:00:03.991
I want to start with a game. Okay?

00:00:04.015 --> 00:00:06.410
And to win this game,

00:00:06.434 --> 00:00:09.323
all you have to do is see
the reality that's in front of you

00:00:09.347 --> 00:00:11.339
as it really is, all right?

00:00:11.363 --> 00:00:13.950
So we have two panels here,
of colored dots.

00:00:14.846 --> 00:00:19.171
And one of those dots
is the same in the two panels.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.418
And you have to tell me which one.

00:00:23.442 --> 00:00:24.890
Now, I narrowed it down

00:00:24.914 --> 00:00:29.585
to the gray one, the green one,
and, say, the orange one.

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.672
So by a show of hands,
we'll start with the easiest one.

00:00:32.696 --> 00:00:35.410
Show of hands: how many people
think it's the gray one?

00:00:36.434 --> 00:00:37.976
Really? Okay.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.974
How many people think it's the green one?

00:00:42.577 --> 00:00:45.011
And how many people
think it's the orange one?

00:00:46.875 --> 00:00:48.760
Pretty even split.

00:00:50.323 --> 00:00:52.590
Let's find out what the reality is.

00:00:52.614 --> 00:00:54.434
Here is the orange one.

00:00:55.713 --> 00:00:57.149
(Laughter)

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.324
Here is the green one.

00:01:01.212 --> 00:01:03.213
And here is the gray one.

00:01:04.712 --> 00:01:07.976
(Laughter)

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.799
So for all of you who saw that,
you're complete realists.

00:01:11.268 --> 00:01:12.441
All right?

00:01:12.465 --> 00:01:13.976
(Laughter)

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.771
So this is pretty amazing, isn't it?

00:01:15.795 --> 00:01:17.597
Because nearly every living system

00:01:17.621 --> 00:01:21.529
has evolved the ability
to detect light in one way or another.

00:01:21.553 --> 00:01:23.394
So for us, seeing color

00:01:23.418 --> 00:01:25.728
is one of the simplest things
the brain does.

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:28.553
And yet, even at this
most fundamental level,

00:01:28.577 --> 00:01:31.196
context is everything.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.401
What I'm going to talk about
is not that context is everything,

00:01:34.425 --> 00:01:36.450
but why context is everything.

00:01:36.474 --> 00:01:38.690
Because it's answering that question

00:01:38.714 --> 00:01:42.258
that tells us not only
why we see what we do,

00:01:42.282 --> 00:01:43.976
but who we are as individuals,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.881
and who we are as a society.

00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:49.552
But first, we have to ask
another question,

00:01:49.576 --> 00:01:51.084
which is, "What is color for?"

00:01:51.108 --> 00:01:53.323
And instead of telling you,
I'll just show you.

00:01:53.347 --> 00:01:55.976
What you see here is a jungle scene,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.784
and you see the surfaces
according to the amount of light

00:01:58.808 --> 00:02:00.473
that those surfaces reflect.

00:02:00.497 --> 00:02:04.880
Now, can any of you see the predator
that's about to jump out at you?

00:02:04.904 --> 00:02:07.928
And if you haven't seen it yet,
you're dead, right?

00:02:07.952 --> 00:02:08.953
(Laughter)

00:02:08.977 --> 00:02:11.315
Can anyone see it? Anyone? No?

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:12.808
Now let's see the surfaces

00:02:12.832 --> 00:02:15.686
according to the quality of light
that they reflect.

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.251
And now you see it.

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:20.594
So, color enables us to see

00:02:20.618 --> 00:02:23.044
the similarities and differences
between surfaces,

00:02:23.068 --> 00:02:26.114
according to the full spectrum
of light that they reflect.

00:02:26.138 --> 00:02:27.599
But what you've just done

00:02:27.623 --> 00:02:30.663
is in many respects
mathematically impossible.

00:02:30.687 --> 00:02:31.934
Why?

00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:33.388
Because, as Berkeley tells us,

00:02:33.412 --> 00:02:35.975
we have no direct access
to our physical world,

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:37.976
other than through our senses.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.815
And the light that falls onto our eyes

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:42.101
is determined by multiple
things in the world,

00:02:42.125 --> 00:02:43.976
not only the color of objects,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.976
but also the color of their illumination,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.809
and the color of the space
between us and those objects.

00:02:48.833 --> 00:02:51.086
You vary any one of those parameters,

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.632
and you'll change the color
of the light that falls onto your eye.

00:02:56.148 --> 00:02:57.332
This is a huge problem,

00:02:57.356 --> 00:03:00.325
because it means that the same image

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.870
could have an infinite number
of possible real-world sources.

00:03:03.894 --> 00:03:05.235
Let me show you what I mean.

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:08.092
Imagine that this
is the back of your eye, okay?

00:03:08.116 --> 00:03:10.616
And these are two projections
from the world.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.103
They're identical in every single way.

00:03:13.127 --> 00:03:17.159
Identical in shape,
size, spectral content.

00:03:17.183 --> 00:03:19.952
They are the same,
as far as your eye is concerned.

00:03:20.998 --> 00:03:25.092
And yet they come
from completely different sources.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.721
The one on the right
comes from a yellow surface,

00:03:30.745 --> 00:03:33.150
in shadow, oriented facing the left,

00:03:33.174 --> 00:03:36.046
viewed through a pinkish medium.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.314
The one on the left comes
from an orange surface,

00:03:39.338 --> 00:03:41.521
under direct light, facing to the right,

00:03:41.545 --> 00:03:43.529
viewed through sort of a bluish medium.

00:03:43.553 --> 00:03:45.728
Completely different meanings,

00:03:45.752 --> 00:03:49.029
giving rise to the exact same
retinal information.

00:03:49.053 --> 00:03:52.370
And yet it's only the retinal
information that we get.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.362
So how on Earth do we even see?

00:03:56.386 --> 00:03:59.593
So if you remember anything
in this next 18 minutes,

00:03:59.617 --> 00:04:00.863
remember this:

00:04:00.887 --> 00:04:02.829
that the light that falls onto your eye,

00:04:02.853 --> 00:04:05.276
sensory information, is meaningless,

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.418
because it could mean literally anything.

00:04:07.998 --> 00:04:11.543
And what's true for sensory information
is true for information generally.

00:04:11.567 --> 00:04:13.600
There's no inherent
meaning in information.

00:04:13.624 --> 00:04:16.037
It's what we do with that
information that matters.

00:04:16.735 --> 00:04:20.458
So, how do we see?
Well, we see by learning to see.

00:04:20.482 --> 00:04:24.021
The brain evolved the mechanisms
for finding patterns,

00:04:24.045 --> 00:04:26.085
finding relationships in information,

00:04:26.109 --> 00:04:30.307
and associating those relationships
with a behavioral meaning,

00:04:30.331 --> 00:04:33.196
a significance, by interacting
with the world.

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.975
We're very aware of this

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:37.828
in the form of more cognitive
attributes, like language.

00:04:37.852 --> 00:04:39.885
I'm going to give you some letter strings,

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:42.402
and I want you to read them
out for me, if you can.

00:04:42.426 --> 00:04:44.091
Audience: "Can you read this?"

00:04:44.932 --> 00:04:46.976
"You are not reading this."

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.876
"What are you reading?"

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.284
Beau Lotto: "What are you reading?"
Half the letters are missing, right?

00:04:52.308 --> 00:04:53.617
There's no a priori reason

00:04:53.641 --> 00:04:56.133
why an "H" has to go
between that "W" and "A."

00:04:56.157 --> 00:04:57.712
But you put one there. Why?

00:04:57.736 --> 00:05:00.092
Because in the statistics
of your past experience,

00:05:00.116 --> 00:05:01.810
it would have been useful to do so.

00:05:01.834 --> 00:05:03.275
So you do so again.

00:05:03.299 --> 00:05:05.976
And yet you don't put a letter
after that first "T."

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.864
Why? Because it wouldn't have been
useful in the past.

00:05:08.888 --> 00:05:10.976
So you don't do it again.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.869
So, let me show you how quickly
our brains can redefine normality,

00:05:14.893 --> 00:05:17.623
even at the simplest thing
the brain does, which is color.

00:05:17.647 --> 00:05:20.281
So if I could have
the lights down up here.

00:05:20.305 --> 00:05:24.104
I want you to first notice that those
two desert scenes are physically the same.

00:05:24.128 --> 00:05:26.305
One is simply the flipping of the other.

00:05:28.084 --> 00:05:30.394
Now I want you to look at that dot

00:05:30.418 --> 00:05:32.975
between the green and the red.

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:35.976
And I want you to stare at that dot.
Don't look anywhere else.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.206
We're going to look
at it for about 30 seconds,

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.672
which is a bit of a killer
in an 18-minute talk.

00:05:40.696 --> 00:05:41.989
(Laughter)

00:05:42.013 --> 00:05:43.607
But I really want you to learn.

00:05:43.631 --> 00:05:45.932
And I'll tell you -- don't look
anywhere else --

00:05:45.956 --> 00:05:48.011
I'll tell you what's
happening in your head.

00:05:48.035 --> 00:05:49.302
Your brain is learning,

00:05:49.326 --> 00:05:52.054
and it's learning
that the right side of its visual field

00:05:52.078 --> 00:05:53.371
is under red illumination;

00:05:53.395 --> 00:05:56.322
the left side of its visual field
is under green illumination.

00:05:56.346 --> 00:05:59.232
That's what it's learning. Okay?

00:05:59.256 --> 00:06:03.935
Now, when I tell you, I want you to look
at the dot between the two desert scenes.

00:06:03.959 --> 00:06:05.974
So why don't you do that now?

00:06:05.998 --> 00:06:09.358
(Laughter)

00:06:09.382 --> 00:06:11.285
Can I have the lights up again?

00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:14.775
I take it from your response
they don't look the same anymore, right?

00:06:14.799 --> 00:06:15.976
(Applause)

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.976
Why? Because your brain
is seeing that same information

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.687
as if the right one is still
under red light,

00:06:21.711 --> 00:06:23.869
and the left one is still
under green light.

00:06:23.893 --> 00:06:25.258
That's your new normal.

00:06:25.282 --> 00:06:27.288
Okay? So, what does this mean for context?

00:06:27.312 --> 00:06:29.646
It means I can take two identical squares,

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:31.490
put them in light and dark surrounds,

00:06:31.514 --> 00:06:34.999
and the one on the dark surround
looks lighter than on the light surround.

00:06:35.023 --> 00:06:38.607
What's significant is not simply the light
and dark surrounds that matter.

00:06:38.631 --> 00:06:42.276
It's what those light and dark surrounds
meant for your behavior in the past.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.697
So I'll show you what I mean.

00:06:43.721 --> 00:06:45.704
Here we have that exact same illusion.

00:06:45.728 --> 00:06:47.854
We have two identical tiles on the left,

00:06:47.878 --> 00:06:50.164
one in a dark surround,
one in a light surround.

00:06:50.188 --> 00:06:52.267
And the same thing over on the right.

00:06:52.291 --> 00:06:55.142
Now, I'll reveal those two scenes,

00:06:55.166 --> 00:06:57.834
but I'm not going to change
anything within those boxes,

00:06:57.858 --> 00:06:59.009
except their meaning.

00:06:59.033 --> 00:07:01.346
And see what happens to your perception.

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:02.976
Notice that on the left

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.765
the two tiles look nearly
completely opposite:

00:07:05.789 --> 00:07:08.880
one very white and one very dark, right?

00:07:08.904 --> 00:07:12.179
Whereas on the right,
the two tiles look nearly the same.

00:07:12.203 --> 00:07:14.441
And yet there is still one
on a dark surround,

00:07:14.465 --> 00:07:15.830
and one on a light surround.

00:07:15.854 --> 00:07:17.005
Why?

00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:20.976
Because if the tile in that shadow
were in fact in shadow,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.429
and reflecting the same
amount of light to your eye

00:07:23.453 --> 00:07:25.221
as the one outside the shadow,

00:07:25.245 --> 00:07:28.642
it would have to be more reflective
-- just the laws of physics.

00:07:28.666 --> 00:07:30.184
So you see it that way.

00:07:30.208 --> 00:07:32.866
Whereas on the right,
the information is consistent

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:35.573
with those two tiles
being under the same light.

00:07:35.597 --> 00:07:39.430
If they're under the same light reflecting
the same amount of light to your eye,

00:07:39.454 --> 00:07:41.239
then they must be equally reflective.

00:07:41.263 --> 00:07:42.526
So you see it that way.

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:45.076
Which means we can bring
all this information together

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.148
to create some incredibly
strong illusions.

00:07:47.172 --> 00:07:48.976
This is one I made a few years ago.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.313
And you'll notice you see
a dark brown tile at the top,

00:07:52.337 --> 00:07:54.816
and a bright orange tile at the side.

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.570
That is your perceptual reality.

00:07:56.594 --> 00:07:59.558
The physical reality
is that those two tiles are the same.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.976
Here you see four gray tiles on your left,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.512
seven gray tiles on the right.

00:08:07.536 --> 00:08:09.593
I'm not going to change
those tiles at all,

00:08:09.617 --> 00:08:11.784
but I'm going to reveal
the rest of the scene.

00:08:11.808 --> 00:08:13.766
And see what happens to your perception.

00:08:14.361 --> 00:08:17.870
The four blue tiles on the left are gray.

00:08:17.894 --> 00:08:21.547
The seven yellow tiles
on the right are also gray.

00:08:21.571 --> 00:08:23.452
They are the same. Okay?

00:08:23.476 --> 00:08:25.514
Don't believe me? Let's watch it again.

00:08:27.398 --> 00:08:31.652
What's true for color is also true
for complex perceptions of motion.

00:08:31.676 --> 00:08:34.485
So, here we have --

00:08:34.509 --> 00:08:37.773
let's turn this around -- a diamond.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.620
And what I'm going to do is,
I'm going to hold it here,

00:08:41.644 --> 00:08:43.490
and I'm going to spin it.

00:08:44.831 --> 00:08:47.975
And for all of you, you'll see it
probably spinning this direction.

00:08:47.999 --> 00:08:50.611
Now I want you to keep looking at it.

00:08:50.635 --> 00:08:53.135
Move your eyes around,
blink, maybe close one eye.

00:08:53.159 --> 00:08:56.976
And suddenly it will flip, and start
spinning the opposite direction.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.172
Yes? Raise your hand if you got that. Yes?

00:09:00.196 --> 00:09:01.403
Keep blinking.

00:09:01.427 --> 00:09:04.012
Every time you blink, it will switch.

00:09:04.036 --> 00:09:06.633
So I can ask you,
which direction is it rotating?

00:09:08.157 --> 00:09:09.427
How do you know?

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:13.250
Your brain doesn't know,
because both are equally likely.

00:09:13.274 --> 00:09:14.812
So depending on where it looks,

00:09:14.836 --> 00:09:18.165
it flips between the two possibilities.

00:09:18.189 --> 00:09:20.113
Are we the only ones that see illusions?

00:09:20.137 --> 00:09:21.976
The answer to this question is no.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.719
Even the beautiful bumblebee,

00:09:23.743 --> 00:09:26.617
with its mere one million brain cells,

00:09:26.641 --> 00:09:29.656
which is 250 times fewer cells
than you have in one retina,

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.508
sees illusions, does
the most complicated things

00:09:32.532 --> 00:09:34.976
that even our most
sophisticated computers can't do.

00:09:35.341 --> 00:09:37.197
So in my lab we work on bumblebees,

00:09:37.221 --> 00:09:39.710
because we can completely
control their experience,

00:09:39.734 --> 00:09:42.267
and see how it alters
the architecture of their brain.

00:09:42.291 --> 00:09:44.392
We do this in what we call the Bee Matrix.

00:09:44.416 --> 00:09:45.690
Here you have the hive.

00:09:45.714 --> 00:09:48.309
You can see the queen bee,
the large bee in the middle.

00:09:48.333 --> 00:09:49.959
Those are her daughters, the eggs.

00:09:49.983 --> 00:09:53.598
They go back and forth between this hive
and the arena, via this tube.

00:09:56.842 --> 00:09:59.429
You'll see one of the bees come out here.

00:09:59.453 --> 00:10:01.547
You see how she has
a little number on her?

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.936
There's another one coming out,
she also has a number on her.

00:10:05.425 --> 00:10:07.696
Now, they're not born that way, right?

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.735
We pull them out, put them
in the fridge, and they fall asleep.

00:10:10.759 --> 00:10:13.052
Then you can superglue
little numbers on them.

00:10:13.076 --> 00:10:14.259
(Laughter)

00:10:14.283 --> 00:10:17.976
And now, in this experiment they get
a reward if they go to the blue flowers.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.193
They land on the flower,

00:10:19.217 --> 00:10:22.726
stick their tongue in there,
called a proboscis, and drink sugar water.

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:25.908
She's drinking a glass of water
that's about that big to you and I,

00:10:25.932 --> 00:10:29.566
will do that about three times, then fly.

00:10:31.906 --> 00:10:34.184
And sometimes they learn
not to go to the blue,

00:10:34.208 --> 00:10:35.976
but to go where the other bees go.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.214
So they copy each other.

00:10:37.238 --> 00:10:39.524
They can count to five.
They can recognize faces.

00:10:39.548 --> 00:10:41.509
And here she comes down the ladder.

00:10:41.533 --> 00:10:44.114
And she'll come into the hive,
find an empty honey pot,

00:10:44.138 --> 00:10:46.195
and throw up, and that's honey.

00:10:46.219 --> 00:10:47.370
(Laughter)

00:10:47.394 --> 00:10:52.204
Now remember, she's supposed
to be going to the blue flowers,

00:10:52.228 --> 00:10:54.855
but what are these bees doing
in the upper right corner?

00:10:54.879 --> 00:10:57.368
It looks like they're
going to green flowers.

00:10:57.392 --> 00:11:00.198
Now, are they getting it wrong?

00:11:00.222 --> 00:11:03.714
And the answer to the question is no.
Those are actually blue flowers.

00:11:03.738 --> 00:11:07.301
But those are blue flowers
under green light.

00:11:07.325 --> 00:11:11.057
So they're using the relationships
between the colors to solve the puzzle,

00:11:11.081 --> 00:11:13.152
which is exactly what we do.

00:11:13.176 --> 00:11:15.507
So, illusions are often used,

00:11:15.531 --> 00:11:19.142
especially in art, in the words
of a more contemporary artist,

00:11:19.166 --> 00:11:21.626
"to demonstrate the fragility
of our senses."

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:23.974
Okay, this is complete rubbish.

00:11:23.998 --> 00:11:27.948
The senses aren't fragile.
And if they were, we wouldn't be here.

00:11:27.972 --> 00:11:30.871
Instead, color tells us
something completely different,

00:11:30.895 --> 00:11:34.263
that the brain didn't actually evolve
to see the world the way it is.

00:11:34.287 --> 00:11:35.498
We can't.

00:11:35.522 --> 00:11:37.934
Instead, the brain
evolved to see the world

00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.976
the way it was useful to see in the past.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.171
And how we see is by continually
redefining normality.

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:54.362
So, how can we take this incredible
capacity of plasticity of the brain

00:11:54.386 --> 00:11:56.910
and get people to experience
their world differently?

00:11:56.934 --> 00:11:59.631
Well, one of the ways we do it
in my lab and studio

00:11:59.655 --> 00:12:02.893
is we translate the light into sound,

00:12:02.917 --> 00:12:05.991
and we enable people to hear
their visual world.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.658
And they can navigate
the world using their ears.

00:12:10.265 --> 00:12:13.621
Here's David on the right,
and he's holding a camera.

00:12:13.645 --> 00:12:15.375
On the left is what his camera sees.

00:12:15.399 --> 00:12:18.407
And you'll see there's a faint line
going across that image.

00:12:18.431 --> 00:12:20.840
That line is broken up into 32 squares.

00:12:20.864 --> 00:12:23.191
In each square,
we calculate the average color.

00:12:23.215 --> 00:12:25.596
And then we just simply
translate that into sound.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.853
And now he's going to turn around,

00:12:28.877 --> 00:12:31.737
close his eyes,

00:12:31.761 --> 00:12:35.023
and find a plate on the ground
with his eyes closed.

00:12:35.047 --> 00:12:36.271
(Continuous sound)

00:12:38.004 --> 00:12:39.332
(Sound changes momentarily)

00:12:40.142 --> 00:12:41.492
(Sound changes momentarily)

00:12:42.983 --> 00:12:45.213
(Sound changes momentarily)

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:49.257
(Sound changes momentarily)

00:12:51.126 --> 00:12:52.963
(Sound changes momentarily)

00:12:53.613 --> 00:12:55.554
Beau Lotto: He finds it. Amazing, right?

00:12:55.578 --> 00:12:58.641
So not only can we create a prosthetic
for the visually impaired,

00:12:58.665 --> 00:13:01.148
but we can also investigate

00:13:01.172 --> 00:13:03.868
how people literally
make sense of the world.

00:13:03.892 --> 00:13:05.527
But we can also do something else.

00:13:05.551 --> 00:13:08.639
We can also make music with color.

00:13:08.663 --> 00:13:10.339
So, working with kids,

00:13:10.363 --> 00:13:12.156
they created images,

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:14.296
thinking about what might
the images you see

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.144
sound like if we could listen to them.

00:13:16.168 --> 00:13:17.976
And then we translated these images.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.976
And this is one of those images.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.976
And this is a six-year-old child
composing a piece of music

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.976
for a 32-piece orchestra.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.001
And this is what it sounds like.

00:13:28.025 --> 00:13:34.703
(Electronic representation
of orchestral music)

00:13:54.589 --> 00:13:56.856
So, a six-year-old child. Okay?

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.997
Now, what does all this mean?

00:14:00.593 --> 00:14:04.933
What this suggests is that no one
is an outside observer of nature, okay?

00:14:04.957 --> 00:14:07.022
We're not defined
by our central properties,

00:14:07.046 --> 00:14:08.710
by the bits that make us up.

00:14:08.734 --> 00:14:12.408
We're defined by our environment
and our interaction with that environment,

00:14:12.432 --> 00:14:14.084
by our ecology.

00:14:14.108 --> 00:14:20.140
And that ecology is necessarily
relative, historical and empirical.

00:14:22.045 --> 00:14:26.306
So, what I'd like to finish with
is this over here.

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:29.591
Because what I've been trying to do
is really celebrate uncertainty.

00:14:29.615 --> 00:14:33.376
Because I think only through uncertainty
is there potential for understanding.

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:36.268
So, if some of you are still
feeling a bit too certain,

00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:37.834
I'd like to do this one.

00:14:37.858 --> 00:14:40.272
So, if we have the lights down.

00:14:40.296 --> 00:14:45.178
And what we have here --

00:14:46.386 --> 00:14:51.156
Can everyone see 25
purple surfaces on your left,

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:55.372
and 25, call it yellowish,
surfaces on your right?

00:14:55.396 --> 00:14:56.710
So now, what I want to do,

00:14:56.734 --> 00:14:59.751
I'm going to put
the middle nine surfaces here

00:14:59.775 --> 00:15:01.402
under yellow illumination,

00:15:01.426 --> 00:15:03.432
by simply putting a filter behind them.

00:15:05.894 --> 00:15:09.865
Now you can see that changes the light
that's coming through there, right?

00:15:09.889 --> 00:15:12.970
Because now the light is going
through a yellowish filter

00:15:12.994 --> 00:15:14.541
and then a purplish filter.

00:15:14.565 --> 00:15:18.876
I'm going to do the opposite
on the left here.

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:24.567
I'm going to put the middle nine
under a purplish light.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.537
Now, some of you will have noticed
that the consequence

00:15:30.561 --> 00:15:33.624
is that the light coming through those
middle nine on the right,

00:15:33.648 --> 00:15:36.456
or your left, is exactly
the same as the light

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:39.172
coming through the middle
nine on your right.

00:15:39.196 --> 00:15:41.781
Agreed? Yes?

00:15:41.805 --> 00:15:44.354
Okay. So they are physically the same.

00:15:44.378 --> 00:15:47.016
Let's pull the covers off.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.341
Now remember --

00:15:53.704 --> 00:15:57.423
you know that the middle nine
are exactly the same.

00:15:57.447 --> 00:15:58.666
Do they look the same?

00:16:00.302 --> 00:16:01.457
No.

00:16:01.481 --> 00:16:03.436
The question is, "Is that an illusion?"

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:04.867
And I'll leave you with that.

00:16:04.891 --> 00:16:06.096
So, thank you very much.

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.285
(Laughter)

00:16:07.309 --> 00:16:10.000
(Applause)
