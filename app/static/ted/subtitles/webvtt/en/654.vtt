00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So, I am indeed going to talk about

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
the spaces men create for themselves,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
but first I want to tell you why I'm here.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I'm here for two reasons. These two guys

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
are my two sons Ford and Wren.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
When Ford was about three years old,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
we shared a very small room together,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
in a very small space.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
My office was on one half of the bedroom,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and his bedroom was on the other half.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And you can imagine, if you're a writer,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that things would get really crowded around deadlines.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So when Wren was on the way,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I realized I needed to find a space of my own.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
There was no more space in the house. So I went out to the backyard,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and without any previous building experience,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and about 3,000 dollars and some

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
recycled materials, I built this space.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
It had everything I needed. It was quiet.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
There was enough space. And I had control, which was very important.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
As I was building this space, I thought

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
to myself, "Surely I'm not the only guy

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
to have to have carved out a space for his own."

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So I did some research.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And I found that there was an historic precedence.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Hemingway had his writing space.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Elvis had two or three manspaces,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
which is pretty unique because he lived with both his wife and his mother in Graceland.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
In the popular culture, Superman had the Fortress of Solitude,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and there was, of course, the Batcave.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
So I realized then that I wanted to go out on a journey

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and see what guys were creating for themselves now.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Here is one of the first spaces I found. It is in Austin, Texas,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
which is where I'm from.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
On the outside it looks like a very typical garage, a nice garage.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
But on the inside, it's anything but.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And this, to me, is a pretty classic manspace.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
It has neon concert posters, a bar

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and, of course, the leg lamp,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
which is very important.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I soon realized that manspaces didn't have to be only inside.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
This guy built a bowling alley in his backyard,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
out of landscaping timbers, astroturf.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And he found the scoreboard in the trash.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Here's another outdoor space, a little bit more sophisticated.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
This a 1923 wooden tugboat,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
made completely out of Douglas fir.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
The guy did it all himself.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And there is about 1,000 square feet of hanging-out space inside.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
So, pretty early on in my investigations

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I realized what I was finding was not what I expected to find,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
which was, quite frankly, a lot of beer can pyramids

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and overstuffed couches and flat-screen TVs.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
There were definitely hang-out spots.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
But some were for working, some were for playing,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
some were for guys to collect their things.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Most of all, I was just surprised with what I was finding.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Take this place for example.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
On the outside it looks like a typical northeastern garage.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
This is in Long Island, New York.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
The only thing that might tip you off is the round window.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
On the inside it's a recreation of a

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
16th century Japanese tea house.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
The man imported all the materials from Japan,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and he hired a Japanese carpenter

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
to build it in the traditional style.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
It has no nails or screws.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
All the joints are hand-carved and hand-scribed.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Here is another pretty typical scene. This is a suburban Las Vegas neighborhood.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
But you open one of the garage doors

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
and there is a professional-size boxing ring inside.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
(Laughter)

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And so there is a good reason for this.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
It was built by this man who is Wayne McCullough.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
He won the silver medal for Ireland

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
in the 1992 Olympics,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
and he trains in this space. He trains other people.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And right off the garage he has his own trophy room

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
where he can sort of bask in his accomplishments,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
which is another sort of important part about a manspace.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
So, while this space represents someone's profession,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
this one certainly represents a passion.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
It's made to look like the inside of an English sailing ship.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
It's a collection of nautical antiques from the 1700s and 1800s.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Museum quality.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
So, as I came to the end of my journey,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
I found over 50 spaces.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And they were unexpected and they were surprising.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
But they were also --

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
I was really impressed by how personalized they were,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
and how much work went into them.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And I realized that's because the guys that I met

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
were all very passionate about what they did.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
And they really loved their professions.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And they were very passionate about their collections and their hobbies.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And so they created these spaces

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
to reflect what they love to do,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
and who they were.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
So if you don't have a space of your own,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
I highly recommend finding one, and getting into it.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Thank you very much.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
(Applause)
