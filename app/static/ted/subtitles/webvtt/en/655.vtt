WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The substance of things unseen.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Cities, past and future.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
In Oxford, perhaps
we can use Lewis Carroll

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and look in the looking glass
that is New York City

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
to try and see our true selves,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
or perhaps pass through to another world.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Or, in the words of F. Scott Fitzgerald,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
"As the moon rose higher,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
the inessential houses began to melt away

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
until gradually I became
aware of the old island

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
here that once flowered
for Dutch sailors' eyes,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
a fresh green breast of the new world."

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
My colleagues and I
have been working for 10 years

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
to rediscover this lost world

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
in a project we call
The Mannahatta Project.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We're trying to discover
what Henry Hudson would have seen

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
on the afternoon of September 12th, 1609,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
when he sailed into New York harbor.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And I'd like to tell you
the story in three acts,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and if I have time still, an epilogue.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So, Act I: A Map Found.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So, I didn't grow up in New York.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I grew up out west in the
Sierra Nevada Mountains, like you see here,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
in the Red Rock Canyon.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And from these early
experiences as a child

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I learned to love landscapes.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And so when it became time
for me to do my graduate studies,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I studied this emerging field
of landscape ecology.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Landscape ecology concerns itself

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
with how the stream and the meadow
and the forest and the cliffs

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
make habitats for plants and animals.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
This experience and this training

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
lead me to get a wonderful job
with the Wildlife Conservation Society,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
which works to save wildlife
and wild places all over the world.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And over the last decade,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I traveled to over 40 countries

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
to see jaguars and bears and elephants

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and tigers and rhinos.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
But every time I would return
from my trips I'd return back to New York City.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And on my weekends I would go up,
just like all the other tourists,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
to the top of the Empire State Building,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and I'd look down on this landscape,
on these ecosystems,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and I'd wonder, "How does this landscape

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
work to make habitat
for plants and animals?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
How does it work to make habitat
for animals like me?"

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I'd go to Times Square and I'd look
at the amazing ladies on the wall,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and wonder why nobody is looking
at the historical figures just behind them.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I'd go to Central Park and see
the rolling topography of Central Park

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
come up against the abrupt and sheer

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
topography of midtown Manhattan.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I started reading about the history
and the geography in New York City.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I read that New York City
was the first mega-city,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
a city of 10 million people
or more, in 1950.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I started seeing paintings like this.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
For those of you who are from New York,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
this is 125th street
under the West Side Highway.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
(Laughter)

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
It was once a beach.
And this painting

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
has John James Audubon,
the painter, sitting on the rock.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And it's looking up on the wooded heights
of Washington Heights

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
to Jeffrey's Hook, where the George
Washington Bridge goes across today.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Or this painting, from the 1740s,
from Greenwich Village.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Those are two students at King's College --
later Columbia University --

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
sitting on a hill, overlooking a valley.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And so I'd go down to Greenwich
Village and I'd look for this hill,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and I couldn't find it.
And I couldn't find that palm tree.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
What's that palm tree doing there?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000
(Laughter)

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
So, it was in the course of these investigations
that I ran into a map.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And it's this map you see here.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
It's held in a geographic information system

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
which allows me to zoom in.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
This map isn't from Hudson's time,
but from the American Revolution,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
170 years later, made by
British military cartographers

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
during the occupation of New York City.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And it's a remarkable map.
It's in the National Archives here in Kew.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
And it's 10 feet long and
three and a half feet wide.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And if I zoom in to lower Manhattan

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
you can see the extent
of New York City as it was,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
right at the end of the American Revolution.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Here's Bowling Green.
And here's Broadway.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And this is City Hall Park.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
So the city basically extended
to City Hall Park.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And just beyond it you can see features

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
that have vanished,
things that have disappeared.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
This is the Collect Pond, which was
the fresh water source for New York City

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
for its first 200 years,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
and for the Native Americans
for thousands of years before that.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
You can see the Lispenard Meadows

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
draining down through here,
through what is TriBeCa now,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
and the beaches that
come up from the Battery,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
all the way to 42nd St.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
This map was made for military reasons.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
They're mapping the roads,
the buildings, these fortifications

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
that they built.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
But they're also mapping
things of ecological interest,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
also military interest: the hills,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
the marshes, the streams.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
This is Richmond Hill,
and Minetta Water,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
which used to run its way
through Greenwich Village.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Or the swamp at Gramercy Park, right here.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Or Murray Hill.
And this is the Murrays' house

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
on Murray Hill, 200 years ago.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Here is Times Square,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
the two streams that came
together to make a wetland

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
in Times Square, as it was
at the end of the American Revolution.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
So I saw this remarkable map in a book.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
And I thought to myself, "You know,
if I could georeference this map,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
if I could place this map
in the grid of the city today,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
I could find these lost features

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
of the city,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
in the block-by-block
geography that people know,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
the geography of where people
go to work, and where they go to live,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
and where they like to eat."

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
So, after some work
we were able to georeference it,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
which allows us to put
the modern streets on the city,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and the buildings, and the open spaces,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
so that we can zoom in
to where the Collect Pond is.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
We can digitize the Collect
Pond and the streams,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
and see where they actually are
in the geography of the city today.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
So this is fun
for finding where things are

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
relative to the old topography.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
But I had another idea about this map.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
If we take away the streets,
and if we take away the buildings,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and if we take away the open spaces,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
then we could take this map.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
If we pull off the 18th century features

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
we could drive it back in time.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
We could drive it back
to its ecological fundamentals:

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
to the hills, to the streams,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
to the basic hydrology
and shoreline, to the beaches,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
the basic aspects that
make the ecological landscape.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Then, if we added maps
like the geology, the bedrock geology,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
and the surface geology,
what the glaciers leave,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
if we make the soil map,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
with the 17 soil classes,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
that are defined by
the National Conservation Service,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
if we make a digital elevation model

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
of the topography
that tells us how high the hills were,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
then we can calculate the slopes.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
We can calculate the aspect.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
We can calculate the
winter wind exposure --

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
so, which way the winter
winds blow across the landscape.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000
The white areas on this map
are the places protected from the winter winds.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
We compiled all the information
about where the Native Americans were, the Lenape.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
And we built a probability map
of where they might have been.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
So, the red areas
on this map indicate the places

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
that are best for human
sustainability on Manhattan,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
places that are close to water,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
places that are near the harbor to fish,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
places protected from the winter winds.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
We know that there was a Lenape settlement

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
down here by the Collect Pond.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
And we knew that they
planted a kind of horticulture,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
that they grew these beautiful gardens
of corn, beans, and squash,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
the "Three Sisters" garden.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
So, we built a model that explains
where those fields might have been.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
And the old fields, the successional fields that go.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
And we might think of these as abandoned.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
But, in fact, they're grassland habitats

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
for grassland birds and plants.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
And they have become
successional shrub lands,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
and these then mix in
to a map of all the ecological communities.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
And it turns out that Manhattan
had 55 different ecosystem types.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
You can think of these as neighborhoods,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
as distinctive as TriBeCa
and the Upper East Side and Inwood --

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
that these are the forest and the wetlands

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
and the marine communities, the beaches.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And 55 is a lot. On a per-area basis,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Manhattan had more ecological communities

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
per acre than Yosemite does,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
than Yellowstone, than Amboseli.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
It was really an extraordinary landscape

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
that was capable of supporting
an extraordinary biodiversity.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
So, Act II: A Home Reconstructed.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
So, we studied the fish and the frogs
and the birds and the bees,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
the 85 different kinds of fish
that were on Manhattan,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
the Heath hens, the species
that aren't there anymore,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
the beavers on all the streams,
the black bears,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
and the Native Americans,
to study how they used

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
and thought about their landscape.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
We wanted to try and map these.
And to do that what we did

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
was we mapped their habitat needs.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Where do they get their food?

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Where do they get their water?
Where do they get their shelter?

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Where do they get their
reproductive resources?

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
To an ecologist, the intersection
of these is habitat,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000
but to most people,
the intersection of these is their home.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
So, we would read in field guides,
the standard field guides

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
that maybe you have on your shelves,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
you know, what beavers need is,
"A slowly meandering stream

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
with aspen trees and alders and willows,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
near the water."
That's the best thing for a beaver.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
So we just started making a list.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Here is the beaver.
And here is the stream,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
and the aspen and the alder
and the willow.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
As if these were the maps
that we would need

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
to predict where you would find the beaver.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Or the bog turtle, needing wet meadows
and insects and sunny places.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Or the bobcat, needing rabbits
and beavers and den sites.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
And rapidly we started to realize
that beavers can be

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
something that a bobcat needs.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
But a beaver also needs things.
And that having it

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
on either side means that
we can link it together,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
that we can create the network

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
of the habitat relationships
for these species.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Moreover, we realized
that you can start out

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
as being a beaver specialist,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
but you can look up what an aspen needs.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
An aspen needs fire and dry soils.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
And you can look at
what a wet meadow needs.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
And it need beavers
to create the wetlands,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
and maybe some other things.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
But you can also talk
about sunny places.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
So, what does a sunny place need?
Not habitat per se.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
But what are the conditions
that make it possible?

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Or fire. Or dry soils.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
And that you can put these
on a grid that's 1,000 columns long

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
across the top and 1,000 rows
down the other way.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
And then we can visualize
this data like a network,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
like a social network.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
And this is the network
of all the habitat relationships

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
of all the plants and animals
on Manhattan,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
and everything they needed,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
going back to the geology,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
going back to time and space
at the very core of the web.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
We call this the Muir Web.
And if you zoom in on it it looks like this.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Each point is a different species

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
or a different stream
or a different soil type.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
And those little gray lines are the connections
that connect them together.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
They are the connections
that actually make nature resilient.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
And the structure of this
is what makes nature work,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
seen with all its parts.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
We call these Muir Webs
after the Scottish-American naturalist

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
John Muir, who said, "When we try
to pick out anything by itself,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
we find that it's bound fast
by a thousand invisible cords

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
that cannot be broken,
to everything in the universe."

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
So then we took the Muir webs
and we took them back to the maps.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
So if we wanted to go between 85th and 86th,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
and Lex and Third,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
maybe there was a stream in that block.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
And these would be the kind of trees
that might have been there,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
and the flowers and the lichens
and the mosses,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
the butterflies, the fish in the stream,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
the birds in the trees.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Maybe a timber rattlesnake lived there.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
And perhaps a black bear walked by.
And maybe Native Americans were there.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
And then we took this data.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
You can see this for yourself
on our website.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
You can zoom into
any block on Manhattan,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
and see what might have
been there 400 years ago.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
And we used it to try
and reveal a landscape

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
here in Act III.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
We used the tools they use in Hollywood

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
to make these fantastic landscapes
that we all see in the movies.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
And we tried to use it to visualize Third Avenue.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
So we would take the landscape
and we would build up the topography.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
We'd lay on top of that the soils and the waters,
and illuminate the landscape.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
We would lay on top of that
the map of the ecological communities.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
And feed into that the map of the species.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
So that we would actually take a photograph,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
flying above Times Square,
looking toward the Hudson River,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
waiting for Hudson to come.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Using this technology, we can make these

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
fantastic georeferenced views.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
We can basically take a picture
out of any window

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
on Manhattan and see what that landscape
looked like 400 years ago.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
This is the view from the East River,
looking up Murray Hill

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
at where the United Nations is today.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
This is the view looking
down the Hudson River,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
with Manhattan on the left,
and New Jersey out on the right,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
looking out toward the Atlantic Ocean.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
This is the view over Times Square,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
with the beaver pond there,
looking out toward the east.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
So we can see the Collect Pond,
and Lispenard Marshes back behind.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
We can see the fields
that the Native Americans made.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
And we can see this
in the geography of the city today.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
So when you're watching "Law and Order,"
and the lawyers walk up the steps

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
they could have walked
back down those steps

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
of the New York Court House,
right into the Collect Pond,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
400 years ago.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
So these images are the work
of my friend and colleague,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Mark Boyer, who is here
in the audience today.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
And I'd just like, if you would
give him a hand,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
to call out for his fine work.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:03.000
(Applause)

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
There is such power in bringing
science and visualization together,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
that we can create images like this,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
perhaps looking on either
side of a looking glass.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
And even though I've only
had a brief time to speak,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
I hope you appreciate that
Mannahatta was a very special place.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
The place that you see here
on the left side

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
was interconnected.
It was based on this diversity.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000
It had this resilience that is
what we need in our modern world.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
But I wouldn't have you think
that I don't like the place

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
on the right, which I quite do.
I've come to love the city

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
and its kind of diversity,
and its resilience,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000
and its dependence on density
and how we're connected together.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
In fact, that I see them
as reflections of each other,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
much as Lewis Carroll did
in "Through the Looking Glass."

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
We can compare these two and hold them
in our minds at the same time,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
that they really are the same place,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
that there is no way that cities
can escape from nature.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
And I think this is what we're learning
about building cities in the future.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
So if you'll allow me a brief epilogue,
not about the past,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
but about 400 years from now,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
what we're realizing is that

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
cities are habitats for people,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
and need to supply what people need:

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
a sense of home, food, water, shelter,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
reproductive resources,
and a sense of meaning.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
This is the particular additional
habitat requirement of humanity.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
And so many of the talks here
at TED are about meaning,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
about bringing meaning to our lives

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
in all kinds of different ways, through technology,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
through art, through science,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
so much so that I think
we focus so much on

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
that side of our lives,
that we haven't given enough

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
attention to the food and the water
and the shelter,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
and what we need to raise the kids.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
So, how can we envision
the city of the future?

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Well, what if we go
to Madison Square Park,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
and we imagine it without all the cars,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
and bicycles instead

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000
and large forests, and streams instead
of sewers and storm drains?

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
What if we imagined the Upper East Side

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
with green roofs, and streams
winding through the city,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
and windmills supplying
the power we need?

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
Or if we imagine the New York
City metropolitan area,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
currently home to 12 million people,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
but 12 million people in the future,
perhaps living at the density of Manhattan,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
in only 36 percent of the area,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
with the areas in between
covered by farmland,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
covered by wetlands,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
covered by the marshes we need.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
This is the kind of future I think we need,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
is a future that has the same diversity

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
and abundance and dynamism of Manhattan,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
but that learns from the
sustainability of the past,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000
of the ecology, the original ecology,
of nature with all its parts.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
Thank you very much.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:48.000
(Applause)
