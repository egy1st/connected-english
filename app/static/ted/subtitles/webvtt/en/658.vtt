00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This is my first time at TED. Normally, as an advertising man,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I actually speak at TED Evil, which is TED's secret sister

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
that pays all the bills.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
It's held every two years in Burma.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And I particularly remember a really good speech

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
by Kim Jong Il on how to get teens smoking again.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
(Laughter)

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
But, actually, it's suddenly come to me after years working in the business,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
that what we create in advertising,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
which is intangible value -- you might call it perceived value,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
you might call it badge value, subjective value,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
intangible value of some kind --

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
gets rather a bad rap.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
If you think about it, if you want to live in a world in the future

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
where there are fewer material goods, you basically have two choices.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
You can either live in a world which is poorer,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
which people in general don't like.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Or you can live in a world where actually intangible value

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
constitutes a greater part of overall value,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
that actually intangible value, in many ways

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
is a very, very fine substitute

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
for using up labor or limited resources

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
in the creation of things.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Here is one example. This is a train which goes from London to Paris.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The question was given to a bunch of engineers,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
about 15 years ago, "How do we make the journey to Paris better?"

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And they came up with a very good engineering solution,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
which was to spend six billion pounds

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
building completely new tracks

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
from London to the coast,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and knocking about 40 minutes off a three-and-half-hour journey time.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Now, call me Mister Picky. I'm just an ad man ...

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
... but it strikes me as a slightly unimaginative way of improving a train journey

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
merely to make it shorter.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Now what is the hedonic opportunity cost

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
on spending six billion pounds on those railway tracks?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Here is my naive advertising man's suggestion.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
What you should in fact do is employ all of the world's top male

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and female supermodels,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
pay them to walk the length of the train, handing out free Chateau Petrus

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
for the entire duration of the journey.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
(Laughter)

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
(Applause)

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Now, you'll still have about three billion pounds left in change,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and people will ask for the trains to be slowed down.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
(Laughter)

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Now, here is another naive advertising man's question again.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And this shows that engineers,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
medical people, scientific people,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
have an obsession with solving the problems of reality,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
when actually most problems, once you reach a basic level of wealth

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
in society, most problems are actually problems of perception.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
So I'll ask you another question.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
What on earth is wrong with placebos?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
They seem fantastic to me. They cost very little to develop.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
They work extraordinarily well.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
They have no side effects,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
or if they do, they're imaginary, so you can safely ignore them.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
(Laughter)

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So I was discussing this. And I actually went to the Marginal Revolution blog

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
by Tyler Cowen. I don't know if anybody knows it.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Someone was actually suggesting that you can take this concept further,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and actually produce placebo education.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
The point is that education doesn't actually work by teaching you things.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
It actually works by giving you the impression

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
that you've had a very good education, which gives you an insane sense

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
of unwarranted self-confidence,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
which then makes you very, very successful in later life.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
So, welcome to Oxford, ladies and gentlemen.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
(Laughter)

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
(Applause)

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
But, actually, the point of placebo education is interesting.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
How many problems of life can be solved

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
actually by tinkering with perception,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
rather than that tedious, hardworking and messy business

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
of actually trying to change reality?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Here's a great example from history. I've heard this attributed to several other kings,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
but doing a bit of historical research,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
it seems to be Fredrick the Great.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Fredrick the Great of Prussia was very, very keen

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
for the Germans to adopt the potato and to eat it,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
because he realized that if you had two sources of carbohydrate,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
wheat and potatoes, you get less price volatility in bread.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And you get a far lower risk of famine,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
because you actually had two crops to fall back on, not one.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
The only problem is: potatoes, if you think about it, look pretty disgusting.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And also, 18th century Prussians ate very, very few vegetables --

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
rather like contemporary Scottish people.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
(Laughter)

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
So, actually, he tried making it compulsory.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
The Prussian peasantry said,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
"We can't even get the dogs to eat these damn things.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
They are absolutely disgusting and they're good for nothing."

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
There are even records of people being executed

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
for refusing to grow potatoes.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
So he tried plan B.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
He tried the marketing solution, which is he declared the potato

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
as a royal vegetable, and none but the royal family could consume it.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And he planted it in a royal potato patch,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
with guards who had instructions

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
to guard over it, night and day,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
but with secret instructions not to guard it very well.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000
(Laughter)

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Now, 18th century peasants know that there is one

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
pretty safe rule in life, which is if something is worth guarding,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
it's worth stealing.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Before long, there was a massive underground

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
potato-growing operation in Germany.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
What he'd effectively done is he'd re-branded the potato.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
It was an absolute masterpiece.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
I told this story and a gentleman from Turkey came up to me and said,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
"Very, very good marketer, Fredrick the Great. But not a patch on Ataturk."

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Ataturk, rather like Nicolas Sarkozy,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
was very keen to discourage the wearing of a veil,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
in Turkey, to modernize it.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Now, boring people would have just simply banned the veil.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
But that would have ended up with a lot of awful kickback

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
and a hell of a lot of resistance.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Ataturk was a lateral thinker.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
He made it compulsory for prostitutes to wear the veil.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000
(Laughter)

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
(Applause)

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
I can't verify that fully, but it does not matter.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
There is your environmental problem solved, by the way, guys:

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
All convicted child molesters

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
have to drive a Porsche Cayenne.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
(Laughter)

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
What Ataturk realized actually is two very fundamental things.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Which is that, actually, first one,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
all value is actually relative.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
All value is perceived value.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
For those of you who don't speak Spanish, jugo de naranja -- it's actually the Spanish for "orange juice."

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Because actually it's not the dollar. It's actually the peso

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
in Buenos Aires. Very clever Buenos Aires street vendors

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
decided to practice price discrimination

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
to the detriment of any passing gringo tourists.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
As an advertising man, I have to admire that.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
But the first thing is that all value is subjective.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Second point is that persuasion is often better than compulsion.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
These funny signs that flash your speed at you,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
some of the new ones, on the bottom right,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
now actually show a smiley face or a frowny face,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
to act as an emotional trigger.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
What's fascinating about these signs is they cost about 10 percent

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
of the running cost of a conventional speed camera,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
but they prevent twice as many accidents.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
So, the bizarre thing, which is baffling

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
to conventional, classically trained economists,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
is that a weird little smiley face

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
has a better effect on changing your behavior

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
than the threat of a £60 fine and three penalty points.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Tiny little behavioral economics detail:

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
in Italy, penalty points go backwards.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
You start with 12 and they take them away.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Because they found that loss aversion

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
is a more powerful influence on people's behavior.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
In Britain we tend to feel, "Whoa! Got another three!"

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Not so in Italy.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Another fantastic case of creating intangible value

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
to replace actual or material value, which remember, is what,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
after all, the environmental movement needs to be about:

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
This again is from Prussia, from, I think, about 1812, 1813.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
The wealthy Prussians, to help in the war against the French,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
were encouraged to give in all their jewelry.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
And it was replaced with replica jewelry

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
made of cast iron.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Here's one: "Gold gab ich für Eisen, 1813."

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
The interesting thing is that for 50 years hence,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
the highest status jewelry you could wear in Prussia

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
wasn't made of gold or diamonds.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
It was made of cast iron.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Because actually, never mind the actual intrinsic value

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
of having gold jewelry. This actually

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
had symbolic value, badge value.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
It said that your family had made a great sacrifice in the past.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
So, the modern equivalent would of course be this.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.000
(Laughter)

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
But, actually, there is a thing, just as there are Veblen goods,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
where the value of the good depends on it being expensive and rare --

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
there are opposite kind of things

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
where actually the value in them depends on them being

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
ubiquitous, classless and minimalistic.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
If you think about it, Shakerism was a proto-environmental movement.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Adam Smith talks about 18th century America,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
where the prohibition against visible displays of wealth was so great,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
it was almost a block in the economy in New England,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
because even wealthy farmers could find nothing to spend their money on

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
without incurring the displeasure of their neighbors.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
It's perfectly possible to create these social pressures

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
which lead to more egalitarian societies.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
What's also interesting, if you look at products

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
that have a high component

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
of what you might call messaging value,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
a high component of intangible value, versus their intrinsic value:

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
They are often quite egalitarian.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
In terms of dress, denim is perhaps the perfect example of something

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
which replaces material value with symbolic value.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Coca-Cola. A bunch of you may be a load of pinkos,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
and you may not like the Coca-Cola company,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
but it's worth remembering Andy Warhol's point about Coke.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
What Warhol said about Coke is, he said,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
"What I really like about Coca-Cola is the president of the United States

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
can't get a better Coke than the bum on the corner of the street."

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Now, that is, actually, when you think about it -- we take it for granted --

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
it's actually a remarkable achievement,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
to produce something that's that democratic.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Now, we basically have to change our views slightly.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
There is a basic view that real value involves making things,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
involves labor. It involves engineering.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
It involves limited raw materials.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
And that what we add on top is kind of false. It's a fake version.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
And there is a reason for some suspicion and uncertainly about it.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
It patently veers toward propaganda.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
However, what we do have now

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
is a much more variegated media ecosystem

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
in which to kind of create this kind of value, and it's much fairer.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
When I grew up, this was basically the media environment of my childhood

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
as translated into food.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
You had a monopoly supplier. On the left,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
you have Rupert Murdoch, or the BBC.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000
(Laughter)

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
And on your right you have a dependent public

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
which is pathetically grateful for anything you give it.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
(Laughter)

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Nowadays, the user is actually involved.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
This is actually what's called, in the digital world, "user-generated content."

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Although it's called agriculture in the world of food.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000
(Laughter)

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
This is actually called a mash-up,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
where you take content that someone else has produced

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
and you do something new with it.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
In the world of food we call it cooking.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
This is food 2.0,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
which is food you produce for the purpose of sharing it with other people.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
This is mobile food. British are very good at that.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Fish and chips in newspaper, the Cornish Pasty,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
the pie, the sandwich.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
We invented the whole lot of them.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
We're not very good at food in general. Italians do great food,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
but it's not very portable, generally.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
(Laughter)

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
I only learned this the other day. The Earl of Sandwich didn't invent the sandwich.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
He actually invented the toasty. But then, the Earl of Toasty would be a ridiculous name.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000
(Laughter)

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Finally, we have contextual communication.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Now, the reason I show you Pernod -- it's only one example.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Every country has a contextual alcoholic drink. In France it's Pernod.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
It tastes great within the borders of that country,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
but absolute shite if you take it anywhere else.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
(Laughter)

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Unicum in Hungary, for example.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
The Greeks have actually managed to produce something called Retsina,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
which even tastes shite when you're in Greece.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
(Laughter)

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
But so much communication now is contextual

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
that the capacity for actually nudging people,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
for giving them better information -- B.J. Fogg,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
at the University of Stanford, makes the point

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
that actually the mobile phone is --

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
He's invented the phrase, "persuasive technologies."

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
He believes the mobile phone, by being location-specific,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
contextual, timely and immediate,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
is simply the greatest persuasive technology device ever invented.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Now, if we have all these tools at our disposal,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
we simply have to ask the question,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
and Thaler and Sunstein have, of how we can use these more intelligently.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
I'll give you one example.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
If you had a large red button of this kind, on the wall of your home,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
and every time you pressed it, it saved 50 dollars for you,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
put 50 dollars into your pension,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
you would save a lot more.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
The reason is that the interface fundamentally determines

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
the behavior. Okay?

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Now, marketing has done a very, very good job of creating

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
opportunities for impulse buying.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Yet we've never created the opportunity for impulse saving.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
If you did this, more people would save more.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
It's simply a question of changing the interface

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
by which people make decisions,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
and the very nature of the decisions changes.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Obviously, I don't want people to do this,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
because as an advertising man I tend to regard saving as just

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
consumerism needlessly postponed.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000
(Laughter)

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
But if anybody did want to do that,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
that's the kind of thing we need to be thinking about, actually:

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
fundamental opportunities to change human behavior.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Now, I've got an example here from Canada.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
There was a young intern at Ogilvy Canada

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
called Hunter Somerville,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
who was working in improv in Toronto,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
and got a part-time job in advertising,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
and was given the job of advertising Shreddies.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Now this is the most perfect case of creating

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
intangible, added value,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
without changing the product in the slightest.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Shreddies is a strange, square, whole-grain cereal,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
only available in New Zealand, Canada and Britain.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
It's Kraft's peculiar way of rewarding loyalty to the crown.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
(Laughter)

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
In working out how you could re-launch Shreddies,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
he came up with this.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Video: (Buzzer)

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Man: Shreddies is supposed to be square.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000
(Laughter)

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Woman: Have any of these diamond shapes gone out?

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
(Laughter)

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Voiceover: New Diamond Shreddies cereal.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Same 100 percent whole-grain wheat in a delicious diamond shape.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
(Applause)

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Rory Sutherland: I'm not sure this isn't the most perfect example

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
of intangible value creation. All it requires is

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
photons, neurons, and a great idea to create this thing.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
I would say it's a work of genius.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
But, naturally, you can't do this kind of thing without a little bit of market research.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Man: So, Shreddies is actually producing a new product,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
which is something very exciting for them.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
So they are introducing new Diamond Shreddies.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
(Laughter)

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
So I just want to get your first impressions when you see that,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
when you see the Diamond Shreddies box there.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000
(Laughter)

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Woman: Weren't they square?

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Woman #2: I'm a little bit confused. Woman #3: They look like the squares to me.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Man: They -- Yeah, it's all in the appearance.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
But it's kind of like flipping a six or a nine. Like a six,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
if you flip it over it looks like a nine.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
But a six is very different from a nine.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Woman # 3: Or an "M" and a "W". Man: An "M" and a "W", exactly.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Man #2: [unclear]

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
You just looked like you turned it on its end. But when you see it like that

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
it's more interesting looking.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Man: Just try both of them.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Take a square one there, first.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:14:03.000
(Laughter)

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Man: Which one did you prefer? Man #2: The first one.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Man: The first one?

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
(Laughter)

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Rory Sutherland: Now, naturally, a debate raged.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
There were conservative elements in Canada, unsurprisingly,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
who actually resented this intrusion.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
So, eventually, the manufacturers actually

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
arrived at a compromise, which was the combo pack.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
(Laughter)

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:34.000
(Applause)

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000
(Laughter)

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
If you think it's funny, bear in mind there is an organization called

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
the American Institute of Wine Economics,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
which actually does extensive research into perception of things,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
and discovers that except for among

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
perhaps five or ten percent of the most knowledgeable people,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
there is no correlation between quality and enjoyment

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
in wine,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
except when you tell the people how expensive it is,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
in which case they tend to enjoy the more expensive stuff more.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
So drink your wine blind in the future.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
But this is both hysterically funny --

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
but I think an important philosophical point,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
which is, going forward, we need more of this kind of value.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
We need to spend more time appreciating what already exists,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
and less time agonizing over what else we can do.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Two quotations to more or less end with.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
One of them is, "Poetry is when you make new things

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
familiar and familiar things new."

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Which isn't a bad definition of what our job is,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
to help people appreciate what is unfamiliar, but also

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
to gain a greater appreciation, and place a far higher value on

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
those things which are already existing.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
There is some evidence, by the way, that things like social networking help do that.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Because they help people share news.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
They give badge value to everyday little trivial activities.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
So they actually reduce the need for actually spending great money on display,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
and increase the kind of third-party

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000
enjoyment you can get from the smallest, simplest things in life. Which is magic.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
The second one is the second G.K. Chesterton quote of this session,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
which is, "We are perishing for want of wonder, not for want of wonders,"

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
which I think for anybody involved in technology, is perfectly true.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
And a final thing: When you place a value on things like health,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
love, sex and other things,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
and learn to place a material value

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
on what you've previously discounted

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
for being merely intangible, a thing not seen,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
you realize you're much, much wealthier than you ever imagined.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Thank you very much indeed.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000
(Applause)
