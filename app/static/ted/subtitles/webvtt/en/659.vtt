WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Our mission is to build

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
a detailed, realistic

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
computer model of the human brain.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And we've done, in the past four years,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
a proof of concept

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
on a small part of the rodent brain,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and with this proof of concept we are now scaling the project up

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
to reach the human brain.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Why are we doing this?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
There are three important reasons.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The first is, it's essential for us to understand the human brain

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
if we do want to get along in society,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and I think that it is a key step in evolution.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The second reason is,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
we cannot keep doing animal experimentation forever,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and we have to embody all our data and all our knowledge

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
into a working model.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
It's like a Noah's Ark. It's like an archive.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And the third reason is that there are two billion people on the planet

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
that are affected by mental disorder,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and the drugs that are used today

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
are largely empirical.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I think that we can come up with very concrete solutions on

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
how to treat disorders.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Now, even at this stage,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
we can use the brain model

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
to explore some fundamental questions

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
about how the brain works.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And here, at TED, for the first time,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I'd like to share with you how we're addressing

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
one theory -- there are many theories --

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
one theory of how the brain works.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
So, this theory is that the brain

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
creates, builds, a version of the universe,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and projects this version of the universe,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
like a bubble, all around us.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Now, this is of course a topic of philosophical debate for centuries.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
But, for the first time, we can actually address this,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
with brain simulation,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and ask very systematic and rigorous questions,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
whether this theory could possibly be true.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
The reason why the moon is huge on the horizon

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
is simply because our perceptual bubble

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
does not stretch out 380,000 kilometers.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
It runs out of space.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
And so what we do is we compare the buildings

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
within our perceptual bubble,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and we make a decision.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
We make a decision it's that big,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
even though it's not that big.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And what that illustrates

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
is that decisions are the key things

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
that support our perceptual bubble. It keeps it alive.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Without decisions you cannot see, you cannot think,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
you cannot feel.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
And you may think that anesthetics work

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
by sending you into some deep sleep,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
or by blocking your receptors so that you don't feel pain,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
but in fact most anesthetics don't work that way.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
What they do is they introduce a noise

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
into the brain so that the neurons cannot understand each other.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
They are confused,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
and you cannot make a decision.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
So, while you're trying to make up your mind

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
what the doctor, the surgeon, is doing

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
while he's hacking away at your body, he's long gone.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
He's at home having tea.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
(Laughter)

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
So, when you walk up to a door and you open it,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
what you compulsively have to do to perceive

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
is to make decisions,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
thousands of decisions about the size of the room,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
the walls, the height, the objects in this room.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
99 percent of what you see

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
is not what comes in through the eyes.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
It is what you infer about that room.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
So I can say, with some certainty,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
"I think, therefore I am."

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
But I cannot say, "You think, therefore you are,"

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000
because "you" are within my perceptual bubble.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Now, we can speculate and philosophize this,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
but we don't actually have to for the next hundred years.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
We can ask a very concrete question.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
"Can the brain build such a perception?"

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Is it capable of doing it?

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Does it have the substance to do it?

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And that's what I'm going to describe to you today.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
So, it took the universe 11 billion years to build the brain.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
It had to improve it a little bit.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
It had to add to the frontal part, so that you would have instincts,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
because they had to cope on land.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
But the real big step was the neocortex.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
It's a new brain. You needed it.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
The mammals needed it

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
because they had to cope with parenthood,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
social interactions,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
complex cognitive functions.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
So, you can think of the neocortex

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
actually as the ultimate solution today,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
of the universe as we know it.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
It's the pinnacle, it's the final product

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
that the universe has produced.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
It was so successful in evolution

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
that from mouse to man it expanded

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
about a thousandfold in terms of the numbers of neurons,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
to produce this almost frightening

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
organ, structure.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And it has not stopped its evolutionary path.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
In fact, the neocortex in the human brain

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
is evolving at an enormous speed.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
If you zoom into the surface of the neocortex,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
you discover that it's made up of little modules,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
G5 processors, like in a computer.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
But there are about a million of them.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
They were so successful in evolution

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
that what we did was to duplicate them

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
over and over and add more and more of them to the brain

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
until we ran out of space in the skull.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
And the brain started to fold in on itself,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
and that's why the neocortex is so highly convoluted.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
We're just packing in columns,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
so that we'd have more neocortical columns

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
to perform more complex functions.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
So you can think of the neocortex actually as

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
a massive grand piano,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
a million-key grand piano.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Each of these neocortical columns

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
would produce a note.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
You stimulate it; it produces a symphony.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
But it's not just a symphony of perception.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
It's a symphony of your universe, your reality.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Now, of course it takes years to learn how

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
to master a grand piano with a million keys.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
That's why you have to send your kids to good schools,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
hopefully eventually to Oxford.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
But it's not only education.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
It's also genetics.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
You may be born lucky,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
where you know how to master your neocortical column,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
and you can play a fantastic symphony.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
In fact, there is a new theory of autism

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
called the "intense world" theory,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
which suggests that the neocortical columns are super-columns.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
They are highly reactive, and they are super-plastic,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
and so the autists are probably capable of

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
building and learning a symphony

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
which is unthinkable for us.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
But you can also understand

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
that if you have a disease

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
within one of these columns,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
the note is going to be off.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
The perception, the symphony that you create

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
is going to be corrupted,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
and you will have symptoms of disease.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
So, the Holy Grail for neuroscience

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
is really to understand the design of the neocoritical column --

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
and it's not just for neuroscience;

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
it's perhaps to understand perception, to understand reality,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
and perhaps to even also understand physical reality.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
So, what we did was, for the past 15 years,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
was to dissect out the neocortex, systematically.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
It's a bit like going and cataloging a piece of the rainforest.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
How many trees does it have?

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
What shapes are the trees?

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
How many of each type of tree do you have? Where are they positioned?

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
But it's a bit more than cataloging because you actually have to

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
describe and discover all the rules of communication,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
the rules of connectivity,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
because the neurons don't just like to connect with any neuron.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
They choose very carefully who they connect with.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
It's also more than cataloging

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
because you actually have to build three-dimensional

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
digital models of them.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
And we did that for tens of thousands of neurons,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
built digital models of all the different types

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
of neurons we came across.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
And once you have that, you can actually

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
begin to build the neocortical column.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
And here we're coiling them up.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
But as you do this, what you see

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
is that the branches intersect

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
actually in millions of locations,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
and at each of these intersections

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
they can form a synapse.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
And a synapse is a chemical location

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
where they communicate with each other.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
And these synapses together

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
form the network

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
or the circuit of the brain.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Now, the circuit, you could also think of as

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
the fabric of the brain.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
And when you think of the fabric of the brain,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
the structure, how is it built? What is the pattern of the carpet?

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
You realize that this poses

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
a fundamental challenge to any theory of the brain,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
and especially to a theory that says

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
that there is some reality that emerges

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
out of this carpet, out of this particular carpet

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
with a particular pattern.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
The reason is because the most important design secret of the brain

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
is diversity.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Every neuron is different.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
It's the same in the forest. Every pine tree is different.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
You may have many different types of trees,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
but every pine tree is different. And in the brain it's the same.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
So there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as another,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
and there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as in yours.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
And your neurons are not going to be oriented and positioned

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
in exactly the same way.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
And you may have more or less neurons.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
So it's very unlikely

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
that you got the same fabric, the same circuitry.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
So, how could we possibly create a reality

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
that we can even understand each other?

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Well, we don't have to speculate.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
We can look at all 10 million synapses now.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
We can look at the fabric. And we can change neurons.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
We can use different neurons with different variations.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
We can position them in different places,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
orient them in different places.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
We can use less or more of them.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
And when we do that

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
what we discovered is that the circuitry does change.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:23.000
But the pattern of how the circuitry is designed does not.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
So, the fabric of the brain,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
even though your brain may be smaller, bigger,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
it may have different types of neurons,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
different morphologies of neurons,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
we actually do share

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
the same fabric.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
And we think this is species-specific,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
which means that that could explain

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
why we can't communicate across species.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
So, let's switch it on. But to do it, what you have to do

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
is you have to make this come alive.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
We make it come alive

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
with equations, a lot of mathematics.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
And, in fact, the equations that make neurons into electrical generators

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
were discovered by two Cambridge Nobel Laureates.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
So, we have the mathematics to make neurons come alive.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
We also have the mathematics to describe

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
how neurons collect information,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
and how they create a little lightning bolt

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
to communicate with each other.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
And when they get to the synapse,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
what they do is they effectively,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
literally, shock the synapse.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
It's like electrical shock

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
that releases the chemicals from these synapses.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
And we've got the mathematics to describe this process.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
So we can describe the communication between the neurons.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
There literally are only a handful

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
of equations that you need to simulate

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
the activity of the neocortex.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
But what you do need is a very big computer.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
And in fact you need one laptop

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
to do all the calculations just for one neuron.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
So you need 10,000 laptops.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
So where do you go? You go to IBM,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
and you get a supercomputer, because they know how to take

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
10,000 laptops and put it into the size of a refrigerator.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
So now we have this Blue Gene supercomputer.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
We can load up all the neurons,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
each one on to its processor,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
and fire it up, and see what happens.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Take the magic carpet for a ride.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Here we activate it. And this gives the first glimpse

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
of what is happening in your brain

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
when there is a stimulation.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
It's the first view.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Now, when you look at that the first time, you think,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
"My god. How is reality coming out of that?"

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
But, in fact, you can start,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
even though we haven't trained this neocortical column

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
to create a specific reality.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
But we can ask, "Where is the rose?"

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
We can ask, "Where is it inside,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
if we stimulate it with a picture?"

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Where is it inside the neocortex?

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Ultimately it's got to be there if we stimulated it with it.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
So, the way that we can look at that

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
is to ignore the neurons, ignore the synapses,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
and look just at the raw electrical activity.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Because that is what it's creating.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
It's creating electrical patterns.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
So when we did this,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
we indeed, for the first time,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
saw these ghost-like structures:

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
electrical objects appearing

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
within the neocortical column.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And it's these electrical objects

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
that are holding all the information about

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
whatever stimulated it.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
And then when we zoomed into this,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
it's like a veritable universe.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
So the next step

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
is just to take these brain coordinates

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
and to project them into perceptual space.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
And if you do that,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
you will be able to step inside

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
the reality that is created

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
by this machine,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
by this piece of the brain.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
So, in summary,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
I think that the universe may have --

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
it's possible --

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
evolved a brain to see itself,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000
which may be a first step in becoming aware of itself.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
There is a lot more to do to test these theories,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
and to test any other theories.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
But I hope that you are at least partly convinced

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
that it is not impossible to build a brain.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
We can do it within 10 years,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
and if we do succeed,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
we will send to TED, in 10 years,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
a hologram to talk to you. Thank you.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.000
(Applause)
