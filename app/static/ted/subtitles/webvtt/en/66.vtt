WEBVTT

00:00:02.103 --> 00:00:04.678
Good morning. How are you?

00:00:04.702 --> 00:00:06.105
(Audience) Good.

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:07.797
It's been great, hasn't it?

00:00:08.408 --> 00:00:10.729
I've been blown away by the whole thing.

00:00:10.753 --> 00:00:12.245
In fact, I'm leaving.

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.175
(Laughter)

00:00:18.096 --> 00:00:21.663
There have been three themes
running through the conference,

00:00:21.687 --> 00:00:23.973
which are relevant
to what I want to talk about.

00:00:23.997 --> 00:00:28.467
One is the extraordinary
evidence of human creativity

00:00:28.491 --> 00:00:30.904
in all of the presentations that we've had

00:00:30.928 --> 00:00:32.880
and in all of the people here;

00:00:32.904 --> 00:00:35.555
just the variety of it
and the range of it.

00:00:36.158 --> 00:00:38.301
The second is that it's put us in a place

00:00:38.325 --> 00:00:40.822
where we have no idea
what's going to happen

00:00:40.846 --> 00:00:42.237
in terms of the future.

00:00:42.261 --> 00:00:45.246
No idea how this may play out.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.892
I have an interest in education.

00:00:46.916 --> 00:00:51.328
Actually, what I find is,
everybody has an interest in education.

00:00:51.352 --> 00:00:52.669
Don't you?

00:00:52.693 --> 00:00:54.095
I find this very interesting.

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:58.077
If you're at a dinner party,
and you say you work in education --

00:00:58.101 --> 00:01:00.846
actually, you're not often
at dinner parties, frankly.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.666
(Laughter)

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.118
If you work in education,
you're not asked.

00:01:07.142 --> 00:01:10.321
(Laughter)

00:01:10.345 --> 00:01:14.304
And you're never asked back, curiously.
That's strange to me.

00:01:14.328 --> 00:01:16.544
But if you are, and you say to somebody,

00:01:16.568 --> 00:01:18.346
you know, they say, "What do you do?"

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.058
and you say you work in education,

00:01:20.082 --> 00:01:22.131
you can see the blood run from their face.

00:01:22.155 --> 00:01:23.840
They're like, "Oh my God. Why me?"

00:01:23.864 --> 00:01:26.140
(Laughter)

00:01:26.164 --> 00:01:27.688
"My one night out all week."

00:01:27.712 --> 00:01:30.322
(Laughter)

00:01:30.346 --> 00:01:33.587
But if you ask about their education,
they pin you to the wall,

00:01:33.611 --> 00:01:37.018
because it's one of those things
that goes deep with people, am I right?

00:01:37.042 --> 00:01:40.535
Like religion and money and other things.

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:45.001
So I have a big interest in education,
and I think we all do.

00:01:45.025 --> 00:01:46.827
We have a huge vested interest in it,

00:01:46.851 --> 00:01:50.171
partly because it's education
that's meant to take us into this future

00:01:50.195 --> 00:01:51.849
that we can't grasp.

00:01:51.873 --> 00:01:53.039
If you think of it,

00:01:53.063 --> 00:01:59.185
children starting school this year
will be retiring in 2065.

00:02:00.272 --> 00:02:01.843
Nobody has a clue,

00:02:01.867 --> 00:02:05.426
despite all the expertise that's been
on parade for the past four days,

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.976
what the world will look like
in five years' time.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.294
And yet, we're meant
to be educating them for it.

00:02:10.318 --> 00:02:12.868
So the unpredictability,
I think, is extraordinary.

00:02:12.892 --> 00:02:16.320
And the third part of this
is that we've all agreed, nonetheless,

00:02:16.344 --> 00:02:21.649
on the really extraordinary
capacities that children have --

00:02:21.673 --> 00:02:24.008
their capacities for innovation.

00:02:24.032 --> 00:02:26.821
I mean, Sirena last night
was a marvel, wasn't she?

00:02:26.845 --> 00:02:28.515
Just seeing what she could do.

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:34.088
And she's exceptional, but I think
she's not, so to speak,

00:02:34.112 --> 00:02:37.017
exceptional in the whole of childhood.

00:02:37.041 --> 00:02:39.872
What you have there is a person
of extraordinary dedication

00:02:39.896 --> 00:02:41.067
who found a talent.

00:02:41.091 --> 00:02:43.677
And my contention is,
all kids have tremendous talents,

00:02:43.701 --> 00:02:46.095
and we squander them, pretty ruthlessly.

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:47.976
So I want to talk about education,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.872
and I want to talk about creativity.

00:02:49.896 --> 00:02:55.992
My contention is that creativity now
is as important in education as literacy,

00:02:56.016 --> 00:02:58.803
and we should treat it
with the same status.

00:02:58.827 --> 00:02:59.939
(Applause)

00:02:59.963 --> 00:03:01.152
Thank you.

00:03:01.176 --> 00:03:05.461
(Applause)

00:03:05.485 --> 00:03:07.771
That was it, by the way.
Thank you very much.

00:03:07.795 --> 00:03:09.910
(Laughter)

00:03:09.934 --> 00:03:11.611
So, 15 minutes left.

00:03:11.635 --> 00:03:14.792
(Laughter)

00:03:14.816 --> 00:03:16.487
"Well, I was born ... "

00:03:16.511 --> 00:03:19.982
(Laughter)

00:03:20.006 --> 00:03:22.656
I heard a great story recently --
I love telling it --

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.051
of a little girl
who was in a drawing lesson.

00:03:25.075 --> 00:03:27.250
She was six, and she was
at the back, drawing,

00:03:27.274 --> 00:03:30.034
and the teacher said this girl
hardly ever paid attention,

00:03:30.058 --> 00:03:31.844
and in this drawing lesson, she did.

00:03:31.868 --> 00:03:33.208
The teacher was fascinated.

00:03:33.232 --> 00:03:36.021
She went over to her,
and she said, "What are you drawing?"

00:03:36.045 --> 00:03:38.536
And the girl said,
"I'm drawing a picture of God."

00:03:39.642 --> 00:03:42.960
And the teacher said, "But nobody
knows what God looks like."

00:03:42.984 --> 00:03:45.072
And the girl said,
"They will in a minute."

00:03:45.096 --> 00:03:51.878
(Laughter)

00:03:56.662 --> 00:03:59.389
When my son was four in England --

00:03:59.413 --> 00:04:01.604
actually, he was four
everywhere, to be honest.

00:04:01.628 --> 00:04:03.380
(Laughter)

00:04:03.404 --> 00:04:06.791
If we're being strict about it,
wherever he went, he was four that year.

00:04:06.815 --> 00:04:09.453
He was in the Nativity play.
Do you remember the story?

00:04:09.477 --> 00:04:10.696
(Laughter)

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.547
No, it was big, it was a big story.

00:04:12.571 --> 00:04:14.876
Mel Gibson did the sequel,
you may have seen it.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.161
(Laughter)

00:04:16.185 --> 00:04:17.746
"Nativity II."

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:21.654
But James got the part of Joseph,
which we were thrilled about.

00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:24.584
We considered this to be
one of the lead parts.

00:04:24.608 --> 00:04:27.095
We had the place crammed
full of agents in T-shirts:

00:04:27.119 --> 00:04:28.533
"James Robinson IS Joseph!"

00:04:28.557 --> 00:04:29.590
(Laughter)

00:04:29.614 --> 00:04:33.242
He didn't have to speak, but you know
the bit where the three kings come in?

00:04:33.266 --> 00:04:35.951
They come in bearing gifts,
gold, frankincense and myrrh.

00:04:35.975 --> 00:04:37.133
This really happened.

00:04:37.157 --> 00:04:40.273
We were sitting there, and I think
they just went out of sequence,

00:04:40.297 --> 00:04:42.876
because we talked to the little boy
afterward and said,

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.696
"You OK with that?" They said,
"Yeah, why? Was that wrong?"

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.876
They just switched.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.210
The three boys came in, four-year-olds
with tea towels on their heads.

00:04:50.234 --> 00:04:53.556
They put these boxes down, and the first
boy said, "I bring you gold."

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.854
And the second boy said,
"I bring you myrrh."

00:04:55.878 --> 00:04:57.960
And the third boy said, "Frank sent this."

00:04:57.984 --> 00:05:03.461
(Laughter)

00:05:10.711 --> 00:05:13.801
What these things have in common
is that kids will take a chance.

00:05:13.825 --> 00:05:17.307
If they don't know, they'll have a go.

00:05:17.331 --> 00:05:20.360
Am I right? They're not
frightened of being wrong.

00:05:20.924 --> 00:05:24.431
I don't mean to say that being wrong
is the same thing as being creative.

00:05:24.886 --> 00:05:27.976
What we do know is,
if you're not prepared to be wrong,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.367
you'll never come up
with anything original --

00:05:30.391 --> 00:05:32.971
if you're not prepared to be wrong.

00:05:32.995 --> 00:05:37.438
And by the time they get to be adults,
most kids have lost that capacity.

00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:39.926
They have become
frightened of being wrong.

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:41.640
And we run our companies like this.

00:05:41.664 --> 00:05:43.316
We stigmatize mistakes.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.642
And we're now running
national education systems

00:05:45.666 --> 00:05:48.205
where mistakes are the worst
thing you can make.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.908
And the result is that
we are educating people

00:05:51.932 --> 00:05:54.274
out of their creative capacities.

00:05:54.298 --> 00:05:58.725
Picasso once said this, he said
that all children are born artists.

00:05:58.749 --> 00:06:01.971
The problem is to remain
an artist as we grow up.

00:06:01.995 --> 00:06:05.227
I believe this passionately,
that we don't grow into creativity,

00:06:05.251 --> 00:06:06.956
we grow out of it.

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:08.863
Or rather, we get educated out of it.

00:06:09.607 --> 00:06:11.510
So why is this?

00:06:12.124 --> 00:06:14.907
I lived in Stratford-on-Avon
until about five years ago.

00:06:14.931 --> 00:06:17.184
In fact, we moved from Stratford
to Los Angeles.

00:06:17.912 --> 00:06:20.536
So you can imagine
what a seamless transition this was.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.976
(Laughter)

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.376
Actually, we lived in a place
called Snitterfield,

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.651
just outside Stratford,

00:06:25.675 --> 00:06:28.310
which is where
Shakespeare's father was born.

00:06:28.334 --> 00:06:30.457
Are you struck by a new thought? I was.

00:06:30.481 --> 00:06:33.076
You don't think of Shakespeare
having a father, do you?

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.473
Do you?

00:06:34.497 --> 00:06:37.388
Because you don't think
of Shakespeare being a child, do you?

00:06:37.412 --> 00:06:38.676
Shakespeare being seven?

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:39.876
I never thought of it.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.592
I mean, he was seven at some point.

00:06:41.616 --> 00:06:43.882
He was in somebody's
English class, wasn't he?

00:06:43.906 --> 00:06:50.693
(Laughter)

00:06:50.717 --> 00:06:52.046
How annoying would that be?

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:55.070
(Laughter)

00:06:59.939 --> 00:07:01.279
"Must try harder."

00:07:01.303 --> 00:07:04.703
(Laughter)

00:07:05.559 --> 00:07:08.540
Being sent to bed by his dad,
to Shakespeare, "Go to bed, now!"

00:07:08.564 --> 00:07:09.722
To William Shakespeare.

00:07:09.746 --> 00:07:11.017
"And put the pencil down!"

00:07:11.041 --> 00:07:12.116
(Laughter)

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.617
"And stop speaking like that."

00:07:13.641 --> 00:07:17.220
(Laughter)

00:07:17.244 --> 00:07:18.568
"It's confusing everybody."

00:07:18.592 --> 00:07:23.862
(Laughter)

00:07:23.886 --> 00:07:29.072
Anyway, we moved
from Stratford to Los Angeles,

00:07:29.096 --> 00:07:31.572
and I just want to say a word
about the transition.

00:07:31.596 --> 00:07:33.398
Actually, my son didn't want to come.

00:07:33.422 --> 00:07:35.817
I've got two kids;
he's 21 now, my daughter's 16.

00:07:35.841 --> 00:07:38.044
He didn't want to come to Los Angeles.

00:07:38.068 --> 00:07:41.856
He loved it, but he had
a girlfriend in England.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.737
This was the love of his life, Sarah.

00:07:44.761 --> 00:07:46.136
He'd known her for a month.

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.510
(Laughter)

00:07:47.534 --> 00:07:50.813
Mind you, they'd had
their fourth anniversary,

00:07:50.837 --> 00:07:52.773
because it's a long time when you're 16.

00:07:52.797 --> 00:07:54.438
He was really upset on the plane.

00:07:54.462 --> 00:07:56.869
He said, "I'll never find
another girl like Sarah."

00:07:56.893 --> 00:07:59.207
And we were rather pleased
about that, frankly --

00:07:59.231 --> 00:08:03.464
(Laughter)

00:08:07.434 --> 00:08:10.380
because she was the main reason
we were leaving the country.

00:08:10.404 --> 00:08:13.404
(Laughter)

00:08:16.141 --> 00:08:18.503
But something strikes you
when you move to America

00:08:18.527 --> 00:08:19.894
and travel around the world:

00:08:19.918 --> 00:08:23.565
every education system on earth
has the same hierarchy of subjects.

00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:25.492
Every one. Doesn't matter where you go.

00:08:25.516 --> 00:08:27.786
You'd think it would be
otherwise, but it isn't.

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:30.791
At the top are mathematics and languages,
then the humanities.

00:08:30.815 --> 00:08:33.106
At the bottom are the arts.
Everywhere on earth.

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:37.495
And in pretty much every system, too,
there's a hierarchy within the arts.

00:08:37.519 --> 00:08:40.376
Art and music are normally given
a higher status in schools

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.828
than drama and dance.

00:08:41.852 --> 00:08:43.959
There isn't an education
system on the planet

00:08:43.983 --> 00:08:45.902
that teaches dance every day to children

00:08:45.926 --> 00:08:47.576
the way we teach them mathematics.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.758
Why?

00:08:48.782 --> 00:08:49.949
Why not?

00:08:49.973 --> 00:08:51.567
I think this is rather important.

00:08:51.591 --> 00:08:53.855
I think math is very important,
but so is dance.

00:08:53.879 --> 00:08:56.759
Children dance all the time
if they're allowed to, we all do.

00:08:56.783 --> 00:08:59.233
We all have bodies, don't we?
Did I miss a meeting?

00:08:59.257 --> 00:09:02.621
(Laughter)

00:09:02.645 --> 00:09:04.966
Truthfully, what happens is,
as children grow up,

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:07.704
we start to educate them progressively
from the waist up.

00:09:07.728 --> 00:09:09.354
And then we focus on their heads.

00:09:09.378 --> 00:09:10.868
And slightly to one side.

00:09:12.044 --> 00:09:14.115
If you were to visit education as an alien

00:09:14.139 --> 00:09:17.120
and say "What's it for, public education?"

00:09:17.144 --> 00:09:19.871
I think you'd have to conclude,
if you look at the output,

00:09:19.895 --> 00:09:21.252
who really succeeds by this,

00:09:21.276 --> 00:09:22.976
who does everything they should,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.731
who gets all the brownie points,
who are the winners --

00:09:25.755 --> 00:09:28.993
I think you'd have to conclude
the whole purpose of public education

00:09:29.017 --> 00:09:30.215
throughout the world

00:09:30.239 --> 00:09:32.218
is to produce university professors.

00:09:32.718 --> 00:09:33.886
Isn't it?

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:35.894
They're the people who come out the top.

00:09:35.918 --> 00:09:37.737
And I used to be one, so there.

00:09:37.761 --> 00:09:41.458
(Laughter)

00:09:41.482 --> 00:09:43.082
And I like university professors,

00:09:43.106 --> 00:09:45.021
but, you know, we shouldn't hold them up

00:09:45.045 --> 00:09:47.976
as the high-water mark
of all human achievement.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.113
They're just a form of life.

00:09:50.137 --> 00:09:51.560
Another form of life.

00:09:51.584 --> 00:09:52.981
But they're rather curious.

00:09:53.005 --> 00:09:54.969
And I say this out of affection for them:

00:09:54.993 --> 00:09:57.068
there's something curious
about professors.

00:09:57.092 --> 00:10:00.838
In my experience -- not all of them,
but typically -- they live in their heads.

00:10:00.862 --> 00:10:03.005
They live up there
and slightly to one side.

00:10:03.495 --> 00:10:06.931
They're disembodied, you know,
in a kind of literal way.

00:10:06.955 --> 00:10:10.105
They look upon their body as a form
of transport for their heads.

00:10:10.129 --> 00:10:16.176
(Laughter)

00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.577
Don't they?

00:10:17.601 --> 00:10:19.746
It's a way of getting
their head to meetings.

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:24.998
(Laughter)

00:10:25.022 --> 00:10:28.944
If you want real evidence
of out-of-body experiences, by the way,

00:10:28.968 --> 00:10:32.443
get yourself along to a residential
conference of senior academics

00:10:32.467 --> 00:10:34.818
and pop into the discotheque
on the final night.

00:10:34.842 --> 00:10:37.454
(Laughter)

00:10:37.478 --> 00:10:38.834
And there, you will see it.

00:10:38.858 --> 00:10:43.351
Grown men and women
writhing uncontrollably, off the beat.

00:10:43.375 --> 00:10:45.867
(Laughter)

00:10:45.891 --> 00:10:49.216
Waiting until it ends, so they can
go home and write a paper about it.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.221
(Laughter)

00:10:51.245 --> 00:10:55.106
Our education system is predicated
on the idea of academic ability.

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:56.301
And there's a reason.

00:10:56.325 --> 00:10:59.954
Around the world, there were
no public systems of education,

00:10:59.978 --> 00:11:02.085
really, before the 19th century.

00:11:02.109 --> 00:11:05.356
They all came into being
to meet the needs of industrialism.

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:07.432
So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas.

00:11:07.456 --> 00:11:12.018
Number one, that the most useful
subjects for work are at the top.

00:11:12.042 --> 00:11:15.075
So you were probably steered benignly away
from things at school

00:11:15.099 --> 00:11:16.251
when you were a kid,

00:11:16.275 --> 00:11:17.428
things you liked,

00:11:17.452 --> 00:11:19.894
on the grounds you would never
get a job doing that.

00:11:19.918 --> 00:11:21.069
Is that right?

00:11:21.093 --> 00:11:23.505
"Don't do music, you're not
going to be a musician;

00:11:23.529 --> 00:11:25.380
don't do art, you won't be an artist."

00:11:25.404 --> 00:11:28.150
Benign advice -- now, profoundly mistaken.

00:11:28.174 --> 00:11:30.319
The whole world
is engulfed in a revolution.

00:11:30.343 --> 00:11:32.440
And the second is academic ability,

00:11:32.464 --> 00:11:35.283
which has really come to dominate
our view of intelligence,

00:11:35.307 --> 00:11:38.046
because the universities design
the system in their image.

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:39.221
If you think of it,

00:11:39.245 --> 00:11:42.909
the whole system of public education
around the world is a protracted process

00:11:42.933 --> 00:11:44.084
of university entrance.

00:11:44.108 --> 00:11:46.401
And the consequence is
that many highly talented,

00:11:46.425 --> 00:11:48.943
brilliant, creative people
think they're not,

00:11:48.967 --> 00:11:51.100
because the thing
they were good at at school

00:11:51.124 --> 00:11:53.426
wasn't valued,
or was actually stigmatized.

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:55.679
And I think we can't afford
to go on that way.

00:11:55.703 --> 00:11:57.990
In the next 30 years, according to UNESCO,

00:11:58.014 --> 00:12:01.420
more people worldwide will be
graduating through education

00:12:01.444 --> 00:12:03.639
than since the beginning of history.

00:12:03.663 --> 00:12:04.820
More people.

00:12:04.844 --> 00:12:07.765
And it's the combination
of all the things we've talked about:

00:12:07.789 --> 00:12:10.182
technology and its
transformational effect on work,

00:12:10.206 --> 00:12:12.684
and demography and the huge
explosion in population.

00:12:12.708 --> 00:12:15.145
Suddenly, degrees aren't worth anything.

00:12:15.169 --> 00:12:16.846
Isn't that true?

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:19.851
When I was a student,
if you had a degree, you had a job.

00:12:19.875 --> 00:12:22.673
If you didn't have a job,
it's because you didn't want one.

00:12:22.697 --> 00:12:25.031
And I didn't want one, frankly.

00:12:25.055 --> 00:12:26.646
(Laughter)

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:30.475
But now kids with degrees
are often heading home

00:12:30.499 --> 00:12:32.293
to carry on playing video games,

00:12:32.317 --> 00:12:35.365
because you need an MA
where the previous job required a BA,

00:12:35.389 --> 00:12:37.176
and now you need a PhD for the other.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.976
It's a process of academic inflation.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.756
And it indicates the whole structure
of education is shifting beneath our feet.

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:45.322
We need to radically rethink
our view of intelligence.

00:12:45.346 --> 00:12:47.270
We know three things about intelligence.

00:12:47.294 --> 00:12:48.445
One, it's diverse.

00:12:48.469 --> 00:12:51.450
We think about the world in all the ways
that we experience it.

00:12:51.474 --> 00:12:54.451
We think visually, we think in sound,
we think kinesthetically.

00:12:54.475 --> 00:12:56.796
We think in abstract terms,
we think in movement.

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:58.816
Secondly, intelligence is dynamic.

00:12:59.673 --> 00:13:01.976
If you look at the interactions
of a human brain,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.023
as we heard yesterday
from a number of presentations,

00:13:05.047 --> 00:13:07.205
intelligence is wonderfully interactive.

00:13:07.229 --> 00:13:09.467
The brain isn't divided into compartments.

00:13:09.872 --> 00:13:11.446
In fact, creativity --

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:15.490
which I define as the process of having
original ideas that have value --

00:13:15.514 --> 00:13:17.444
more often than not comes about

00:13:17.468 --> 00:13:21.025
through the interaction of different
disciplinary ways of seeing things.

00:13:22.472 --> 00:13:26.103
By the way, there's a shaft of nerves
that joins the two halves of the brain,

00:13:26.127 --> 00:13:27.425
called the corpus callosum.

00:13:27.449 --> 00:13:28.670
It's thicker in women.

00:13:29.471 --> 00:13:31.194
Following off from Helen yesterday,

00:13:31.218 --> 00:13:34.229
this is probably why women
are better at multitasking.

00:13:34.253 --> 00:13:36.078
Because you are, aren't you?

00:13:36.102 --> 00:13:39.436
There's a raft of research,
but I know it from my personal life.

00:13:39.865 --> 00:13:42.800
If my wife is cooking a meal
at home, which is not often ...

00:13:44.224 --> 00:13:45.390
thankfully.

00:13:45.414 --> 00:13:48.104
(Laughter)

00:13:48.128 --> 00:13:49.580
No, she's good at some things.

00:13:49.604 --> 00:13:52.499
But if she's cooking,
she's dealing with people on the phone,

00:13:52.523 --> 00:13:55.170
she's talking to the kids,
she's painting the ceiling --

00:13:55.194 --> 00:13:56.209
(Laughter)

00:13:56.233 --> 00:13:58.258
she's doing open-heart surgery over here.

00:13:58.282 --> 00:14:01.280
If I'm cooking, the door
is shut, the kids are out,

00:14:01.304 --> 00:14:02.543
the phone's on the hook,

00:14:02.567 --> 00:14:04.257
if she comes in, I get annoyed.

00:14:04.281 --> 00:14:07.071
I say, "Terry, please,
I'm trying to fry an egg in here."

00:14:07.095 --> 00:14:13.825
(Laughter)

00:14:14.254 --> 00:14:15.454
"Give me a break."

00:14:15.478 --> 00:14:17.198
(Laughter)

00:14:17.222 --> 00:14:19.721
Actually, do you know
that old philosophical thing,

00:14:19.745 --> 00:14:23.228
"If a tree falls in a forest,
and nobody hears it, did it happen?"

00:14:23.252 --> 00:14:24.581
Remember that old chestnut?

00:14:24.605 --> 00:14:27.515
I saw a great T-shirt
recently, which said,

00:14:27.539 --> 00:14:30.976
"If a man speaks his mind in a forest,
and no woman hears him,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.396
is he still wrong?"

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:38.026
(Laughter)

00:14:40.089 --> 00:14:42.128
And the third thing about intelligence is,

00:14:42.152 --> 00:14:43.521
it's distinct.

00:14:44.114 --> 00:14:46.618
I'm doing a new book at the moment
called "Epiphany,"

00:14:46.642 --> 00:14:49.083
which is based on a series
of interviews with people

00:14:49.107 --> 00:14:50.971
about how they discovered their talent.

00:14:50.995 --> 00:14:53.116
I'm fascinated by
how people got to be there.

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:56.331
It's really prompted by a conversation
I had with a wonderful woman

00:14:56.355 --> 00:14:59.032
who maybe most people
have never heard of, Gillian Lynne.

00:14:59.056 --> 00:15:00.652
Have you heard of her? Some have.

00:15:00.676 --> 00:15:03.128
She's a choreographer,
and everybody knows her work.

00:15:03.152 --> 00:15:05.168
She did "Cats" and "Phantom of the Opera."

00:15:05.192 --> 00:15:06.343
She's wonderful.

00:15:06.367 --> 00:15:09.314
I used to be on the board
of The Royal Ballet, as you can see.

00:15:09.338 --> 00:15:11.267
(Laughter)

00:15:11.291 --> 00:15:14.816
Gillian and I had lunch one day.
I said, "How did you get to be a dancer?"

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:15.991
It was interesting.

00:15:16.015 --> 00:15:18.262
When she was at school,
she was really hopeless.

00:15:18.286 --> 00:15:21.075
And the school, in the '30s,
wrote to her parents and said,

00:15:21.099 --> 00:15:23.134
"We think Gillian
has a learning disorder."

00:15:23.158 --> 00:15:25.256
She couldn't concentrate;
she was fidgeting.

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.157
I think now they'd say she had ADHD.

00:15:27.181 --> 00:15:28.480
Wouldn't you?

00:15:28.504 --> 00:15:32.681
But this was the 1930s, and ADHD
hadn't been invented at this point.

00:15:32.705 --> 00:15:34.745
It wasn't an available condition.

00:15:34.769 --> 00:15:37.984
(Laughter)

00:15:38.008 --> 00:15:40.050
People weren't aware they could have that.

00:15:40.074 --> 00:15:42.499
(Laughter)

00:15:42.523 --> 00:15:46.699
Anyway, she went to see this specialist.

00:15:46.723 --> 00:15:50.430
So, this oak-paneled room,
and she was there with her mother,

00:15:50.454 --> 00:15:52.781
and she was led and sat
on this chair at the end,

00:15:52.805 --> 00:15:54.750
and she sat on her hands for 20 minutes,

00:15:54.774 --> 00:15:56.455
while this man talked to her mother

00:15:56.479 --> 00:15:58.943
about all the problems
Gillian was having at school,

00:15:58.967 --> 00:16:02.516
because she was disturbing people,
her homework was always late, and so on.

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:03.691
Little kid of eight.

00:16:03.715 --> 00:16:06.626
In the end, the doctor went
and sat next to Gillian and said,

00:16:06.650 --> 00:16:09.363
"I've listened to all these
things your mother's told me.

00:16:09.387 --> 00:16:10.981
I need to speak to her privately.

00:16:11.005 --> 00:16:13.321
Wait here. We'll be back.
We won't be very long,"

00:16:13.345 --> 00:16:15.995
and they went and left her.

00:16:16.019 --> 00:16:17.659
But as they went out of the room,

00:16:17.683 --> 00:16:20.539
he turned on the radio
that was sitting on his desk.

00:16:20.563 --> 00:16:22.201
And when they got out of the room,

00:16:22.225 --> 00:16:24.603
he said to her mother,
"Just stand and watch her."

00:16:24.627 --> 00:16:27.139
And the minute they left the room,

00:16:27.163 --> 00:16:29.758
she was on her feet, moving to the music.

00:16:29.782 --> 00:16:33.285
And they watched for a few minutes,
and he turned to her mother and said,

00:16:33.309 --> 00:16:35.288
"Mrs. Lynne, Gillian isn't sick.

00:16:35.312 --> 00:16:36.976
She's a dancer.

00:16:38.338 --> 00:16:39.724
Take her to a dance school."

00:16:39.748 --> 00:16:40.976
I said, "What happened?"

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.976
She said, "She did. I can't tell you
how wonderful it was.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.829
We walked in this room,
and it was full of people like me --

00:16:46.853 --> 00:16:49.075
people who couldn't sit still,

00:16:49.099 --> 00:16:52.006
people who had to move to think."

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:53.862
Who had to move to think.

00:16:53.886 --> 00:16:57.496
They did ballet, they did tap, jazz;
they did modern; they did contemporary.

00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:00.266
She was eventually auditioned
for the Royal Ballet School.

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:03.543
She became a soloist; she had
a wonderful career at the Royal Ballet.

00:17:03.567 --> 00:17:06.122
She eventually graduated
from the Royal Ballet School,

00:17:06.146 --> 00:17:08.074
founded the Gillian Lynne Dance Company,

00:17:08.098 --> 00:17:09.335
met Andrew Lloyd Webber.

00:17:09.359 --> 00:17:10.655
She's been responsible for

00:17:10.679 --> 00:17:13.827
some of the most successful
musical theater productions in history,

00:17:13.851 --> 00:17:15.447
she's given pleasure to millions,

00:17:15.471 --> 00:17:16.878
and she's a multimillionaire.

00:17:16.902 --> 00:17:20.612
Somebody else might have put her
on medication and told her to calm down.

00:17:20.636 --> 00:17:27.418
(Applause)

00:17:28.603 --> 00:17:30.176
What I think it comes to is this:

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.976
Al Gore spoke the other night

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.519
about ecology and the revolution
that was triggered by Rachel Carson.

00:17:37.257 --> 00:17:39.369
I believe our only hope for the future

00:17:39.393 --> 00:17:43.268
is to adopt a new conception
of human ecology,

00:17:43.292 --> 00:17:45.819
one in which we start
to reconstitute our conception

00:17:45.843 --> 00:17:48.104
of the richness of human capacity.

00:17:48.128 --> 00:17:51.499
Our education system has mined our minds

00:17:51.523 --> 00:17:54.964
in the way that we strip-mine the earth
for a particular commodity.

00:17:55.377 --> 00:17:57.799
And for the future, it won't serve us.

00:17:57.823 --> 00:17:59.976
We have to rethink
the fundamental principles

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.063
on which we're educating our children.

00:18:02.087 --> 00:18:04.761
There was a wonderful quote
by Jonas Salk, who said,

00:18:04.785 --> 00:18:09.882
"If all the insects
were to disappear from the Earth,

00:18:09.906 --> 00:18:12.689
within 50 years,
all life on Earth would end.

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:16.807
If all human beings
disappeared from the Earth,

00:18:16.831 --> 00:18:19.465
within 50 years,
all forms of life would flourish."

00:18:20.378 --> 00:18:21.663
And he's right.

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:26.121
What TED celebrates is the gift
of the human imagination.

00:18:26.533 --> 00:18:30.767
We have to be careful now
that we use this gift wisely,

00:18:30.791 --> 00:18:34.020
and that we avert some of the scenarios
that we've talked about.

00:18:34.044 --> 00:18:37.799
And the only way we'll do it
is by seeing our creative capacities

00:18:37.823 --> 00:18:39.610
for the richness they are

00:18:39.634 --> 00:18:42.816
and seeing our children
for the hope that they are.

00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:45.238
And our task is to educate
their whole being,

00:18:45.262 --> 00:18:46.675
so they can face this future.

00:18:46.699 --> 00:18:49.204
By the way -- we may not see this future,

00:18:49.228 --> 00:18:50.791
but they will.

00:18:50.815 --> 00:18:53.533
And our job is to help them
make something of it.

00:18:53.557 --> 00:18:54.742
Thank you very much.

00:18:54.766 --> 00:19:00.213
(Applause)
