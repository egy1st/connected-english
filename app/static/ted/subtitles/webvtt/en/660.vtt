WEBVTT

00:00:01.047 --> 00:00:02.366
Over the next five minutes,

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:06.039
my intention is to transform
your relationship with sound.

00:00:06.063 --> 00:00:07.638
Let me start with the observation

00:00:07.662 --> 00:00:09.880
that most of the sound
around us is accidental;

00:00:09.904 --> 00:00:12.018
much of it is unpleasant. (Traffic noise)

00:00:12.042 --> 00:00:14.805
We stand on street corners,
shouting over noise like this,

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:16.205
pretending it doesn't exist.

00:00:16.229 --> 00:00:18.206
This habit of suppressing sound has meant

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.578
that our relationship with sound
has become largely unconscious.

00:00:21.602 --> 00:00:24.579
There are four major ways
sound is affecting you all the time,

00:00:24.603 --> 00:00:27.198
and I'd like to raise them
in your consciousness today.

00:00:27.222 --> 00:00:28.843
The first is physiological.

00:00:28.867 --> 00:00:31.737
(Alarm clocks ring)

00:00:31.761 --> 00:00:32.917
Sorry about that.

00:00:32.941 --> 00:00:35.864
I just gave you a shot of cortisol,
your fight-flight hormone.

00:00:35.888 --> 00:00:38.642
Sounds are affecting
your hormone secretions all the time,

00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:41.906
but also your breathing, heart rate --
which I just also did --

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.355
and your brainwaves.

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.882
It's not just unpleasant sounds
like that that do it.

00:00:45.906 --> 00:00:47.215
This is surf. (Ocean waves)

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.732
It has the frequency of roughly
12 cycles per minute.

00:00:49.756 --> 00:00:51.505
Most people find that very soothing,

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:54.625
and, interestingly, 12 cycles per minute
is roughly the frequency

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:56.428
of the breathing of a sleeping human,

00:00:56.452 --> 00:00:58.769
so there is a deep resonance
with being at rest.

00:00:58.793 --> 00:01:02.098
We also associate it
with being stress-free and on holiday.

00:01:02.122 --> 00:01:05.465
The second way in which sound
affects you is psychological.

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.974
Music is the most powerful form
of sound that we know

00:01:07.998 --> 00:01:10.507
that affects our emotional state.
(Albinoni's Adagio)

00:01:10.531 --> 00:01:13.976
This is guaranteed to make most of you
feel pretty sad if I leave it on.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.477
Music is not the only kind of sound,
however, which affects your emotions.

00:01:17.501 --> 00:01:19.335
Natural sound can do that, too.

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:22.976
Birdsong, for example, is a sound
which most people find reassuring.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.511
There's a reason:
over hundreds of thousands of years

00:01:25.535 --> 00:01:28.504
we've learned that when the birds
are singing, things are safe.

00:01:28.528 --> 00:01:30.533
It's when they stop
you need to be worried.

00:01:30.557 --> 00:01:33.185
The third way in which
sound affects you is cognitively.

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:36.046
You can't understand two people
talking at once (Voice-over)

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.115
or in this case, one person talking twice.

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:40.693
You have to choose which me
you're going to listen to.

00:01:40.717 --> 00:01:44.081
We have a very small amount of bandwidth
for processing auditory input,

00:01:44.105 --> 00:01:45.665
which is why noise like this ...

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:46.704
(Office noise)

00:01:46.728 --> 00:01:48.614
is extremely damaging for productivity.

00:01:48.638 --> 00:01:51.147
If you have to work
in an open-plan office like this,

00:01:51.171 --> 00:01:52.976
your productivity is greatly reduced.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.477
And whatever number you're thinking of,
it probably isn't as bad as this.

00:01:56.501 --> 00:02:00.050
[Open-plan offices productivity down 66%]

00:02:00.074 --> 00:02:03.691
You are one-third as productive
in open-plan offices as in quiet rooms.

00:02:03.715 --> 00:02:04.866
I have a tip for you:

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.675
if you work in spaces like that,
carry headphones with you,

00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:09.437
with a soothing sound like birdsong.

00:02:09.461 --> 00:02:13.045
Put them on, and your productivity
goes back up to triple what it would be.

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.299
The fourth way in which
sound affects us is behaviorally.

00:02:16.323 --> 00:02:18.008
With all that other stuff going on,

00:02:18.032 --> 00:02:20.395
it would be amazing
if our behavior didn't change.

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:21.428
(Techno music)

00:02:21.452 --> 00:02:23.871
So ask yourself: Is this person
ever going to drive

00:02:23.895 --> 00:02:25.369
at a steady 28 miles per hour?

00:02:25.393 --> 00:02:26.544
I don't think so.

00:02:26.568 --> 00:02:29.477
At the simplest, you move
away from unpleasant sound

00:02:29.501 --> 00:02:30.936
and towards pleasant sounds.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.397
So if I were to play this ...

00:02:32.421 --> 00:02:33.638
(Jackhammer)

00:02:33.662 --> 00:02:36.234
for more than a few seconds,
you'd feel uncomfortable;

00:02:36.258 --> 00:02:39.323
for more than a few minutes,
you'd be leaving the room in droves.

00:02:39.347 --> 00:02:41.751
For people who can't get away
from noise like that,

00:02:41.775 --> 00:02:43.752
it's extremely damaging for their health.

00:02:43.776 --> 00:02:46.285
And that's not the only thing
that bad sound damages.

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:49.604
Most retail sound is inappropriate
and accidental, even hostile,

00:02:49.628 --> 00:02:51.728
and it has a dramatic effect on sales.

00:02:51.752 --> 00:02:55.140
For you retailers, you may want
to look away before I show this slide.

00:02:55.164 --> 00:02:57.496
[Inappropriate retail soundscapes
sales down 28%]

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.925
They're losing up to 30 percent
of their business

00:02:59.949 --> 00:03:03.207
with people leaving shops faster,
or just turning around at the door.

00:03:03.231 --> 00:03:04.824
We've all done it, left the area,

00:03:04.848 --> 00:03:06.858
because the sound in there is so dreadful.

00:03:06.882 --> 00:03:10.225
I want to spend just a moment
talking about the model we've developed,

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:13.513
which allows us to start at the top
and look at the drivers of sound,

00:03:13.537 --> 00:03:14.704
analyze the soundscape

00:03:14.728 --> 00:03:17.345
and then predict the four outcomes
I just talked about.

00:03:17.369 --> 00:03:20.239
Or start at the bottom
and say what outcomes we want,

00:03:20.263 --> 00:03:22.828
and then design a soundscape
to have a desired effect.

00:03:22.852 --> 00:03:24.953
At last we've got
some science we can apply.

00:03:24.977 --> 00:03:27.388
And we're in the business
of designing soundscapes.

00:03:27.412 --> 00:03:28.689
Just a word on music.

00:03:28.713 --> 00:03:32.360
Music is the most powerful sound there is,
often inappropriately deployed.

00:03:32.384 --> 00:03:33.869
It's powerful for two reasons:

00:03:33.893 --> 00:03:36.976
you recognize it fast,
and you associate it very powerfully.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.594
I'll give you two examples.

00:03:38.618 --> 00:03:40.488
(First chord of "A Hard Day's Night")

00:03:40.512 --> 00:03:42.418
Most of you recognize that immediately.

00:03:42.442 --> 00:03:43.593
The younger, maybe not.

00:03:43.617 --> 00:03:44.825
(Laughter)

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:46.245
(First notes of "Jaws" theme)

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.352
Most of you associate that with something!

00:03:48.376 --> 00:03:50.501
Now, those are one-second
samples of music.

00:03:50.525 --> 00:03:51.677
Music is very powerful,

00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:55.563
and unfortunately, it's veneering
commercial spaces, often inappropriately.

00:03:55.587 --> 00:03:58.493
I hope that's going to change
over the next few years.

00:03:58.517 --> 00:04:01.713
Let me talk about brands for a moment,
since some of you run brands.

00:04:01.737 --> 00:04:04.001
Every brand is out there
making sound right now.

00:04:04.025 --> 00:04:07.382
There are eight expressions of a brand
in sound; they're all important.

00:04:07.406 --> 00:04:10.026
And every brand needs to have
guidelines at the center.

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.309
I'm glad to say
that is starting to happen now.

00:04:12.333 --> 00:04:13.911
(Intel ad jingle)

00:04:13.935 --> 00:04:15.500
You all recognize that one.

00:04:15.524 --> 00:04:16.531
(Nokia ringtone)

00:04:16.555 --> 00:04:19.047
This is the most-played tune
in the world today --

00:04:19.071 --> 00:04:21.279
1.8 billion times a day,
that tune is played.

00:04:21.303 --> 00:04:22.359
(Laughter)

00:04:22.383 --> 00:04:24.741
And it cost Nokia absolutely nothing.

00:04:24.765 --> 00:04:28.317
I'll leave you with four golden rules,
for those of you who run businesses,

00:04:28.341 --> 00:04:29.497
for commercial sound.

00:04:29.521 --> 00:04:30.976
First, make it congruent,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.127
pointing in the same direction
as your visual communication.

00:04:34.151 --> 00:04:36.785
That increases impact
by over 1,100 percent.

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:39.976
If your sound is pointing
the opposite direction, incongruent,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.976
you reduce impact by 86 percent.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.686
That's an order of magnitude, up or down.

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.194
This is important.

00:04:46.218 --> 00:04:48.976
Secondly, make it appropriate
to the situation.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.257
Thirdly, make it valuable.

00:04:50.281 --> 00:04:53.749
Give people something with the sound,
don't just bombard them with stuff.

00:04:53.773 --> 00:04:55.332
Finally, test and test it again.

00:04:55.356 --> 00:04:58.140
Sound is complex; there are many
countervailing influences.

00:04:58.164 --> 00:05:00.141
It can be a bit like a bowl of spaghetti:

00:05:00.165 --> 00:05:02.797
sometimes you just have to eat it
and see what happens.

00:05:02.821 --> 00:05:05.610
So I hope this talk has raised sound
in your consciousness.

00:05:05.634 --> 00:05:07.195
If you're listening consciously,

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:09.331
you can take control
of the sound around you.

00:05:09.355 --> 00:05:11.979
It's good for your health
and for your productivity.

00:05:12.003 --> 00:05:13.796
If we all do that, we move to a state

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.405
that I like to think will be
sound living in the world.

00:05:16.429 --> 00:05:18.826
I'll leave you with more birdsong.
(Birds chirping)

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.135
I recommend at least five minutes
a day, but there's no maximum dose.

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:24.191
Thank you for lending me your ears today.

00:05:24.215 --> 00:05:26.301
(Applause)
