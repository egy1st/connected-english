00:00:00.888 --> 00:00:02.976
Thirteen trillion dollars in wealth

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.976
has evaporated over the course
of the last two years.

00:00:06.553 --> 00:00:08.850
We've questioned the future of capitalism.

00:00:08.874 --> 00:00:11.226
We've questioned the financial industry.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.226
We've looked at our government oversight.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:14.944
We've questioned where we're going.

00:00:14.968 --> 00:00:16.277
And yet, at the same time,

00:00:16.301 --> 00:00:19.177
this very well may be
a seminal moment in American history,

00:00:19.201 --> 00:00:23.526
an opportunity for the consumer
to actually take control and guide us

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.726
to a new trajectory in America.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.475
I'm calling this The Great Unwind.

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:28.501
(Laughter)

00:00:28.525 --> 00:00:31.126
And the idea is a simple, simple idea,

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.230
which is the fact that the consumer
has moved from a state of anxiety

00:00:35.254 --> 00:00:36.412
to action.

00:00:36.436 --> 00:00:40.675
Consumers who represent 72 percent
of the GDP of America

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:44.143
have actually started, just like banks
and just like businesses,

00:00:44.167 --> 00:00:48.251
to de-leverage, to unwind
their leverage in daily life,

00:00:48.275 --> 00:00:51.226
to remove themselves
from the liability and risk

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.126
that presents itself as they move forward.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.883
So, to understand this --
and I'm going to stress this --

00:00:56.907 --> 00:00:59.070
it's not about the consumer
being in retreat.

00:00:59.094 --> 00:01:00.454
The consumer is empowered.

00:01:00.478 --> 00:01:03.735
To understand this, we'll step back
and look at what's happened

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:05.654
over the last year and a half.

00:01:05.678 --> 00:01:07.897
So if you've been gone,
this is the CliffsNotes

00:01:07.921 --> 00:01:09.545
on what's happened in the economy.

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:10.573
(Laughter)

00:01:10.597 --> 00:01:13.667
Unemployment up. Housing values down.
Equity markets down.

00:01:13.691 --> 00:01:15.297
Commodity prices are like this.

00:01:15.321 --> 00:01:17.569
If you're a mom trying to manage a budget,

00:01:17.593 --> 00:01:20.258
and oil was 150 dollars
a barrel last summer,

00:01:20.282 --> 00:01:22.055
and it's somewhere between 50 and 70,

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:23.242
do you plan vacations?

00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:24.424
How do you buy?

00:01:24.448 --> 00:01:27.368
What's your strategy in your household?
Will the bailout work?

00:01:27.392 --> 00:01:30.567
We have national debt, Detroit,
currency valuations, health care --

00:01:30.591 --> 00:01:31.888
all these issues facing us.

00:01:31.912 --> 00:01:34.638
You put them all together,
mix them up in a bouillabaisse,

00:01:34.662 --> 00:01:37.993
and you have consumer confidence
that's basically a ticking time bomb.

00:01:38.017 --> 00:01:40.994
In fact, let's go back and look
at what caused this crisis,

00:01:41.018 --> 00:01:43.496
because the consumer,
all of us, in our daily lives,

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.996
actually contributed
a large part to the problem.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.800
This is something I call
the 50-20 paradox.

00:01:48.824 --> 00:01:51.576
It took us 50 years

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.356
to reach annual savings ratings
of almost 10 percent.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.576
Fifty years.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.478
Do you know what this was right here?
This was World War II.

00:01:59.502 --> 00:02:01.316
Do you know why savings was so high?

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.650
There was nothing to buy,
unless you wanted to buy some rivets.

00:02:04.674 --> 00:02:07.604
What happened, though,
over the course of the last 20 years,

00:02:07.628 --> 00:02:11.788
we went from a 10 percent savings rate
to a negative savings rate.

00:02:11.812 --> 00:02:13.465
Because we binged.

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.282
We bought extra-large cars,
supersized everything,

00:02:17.306 --> 00:02:20.014
we bought remedies
for restless leg syndrome.

00:02:20.038 --> 00:02:23.944
All these things together
basically created a factor

00:02:23.968 --> 00:02:26.556
where the consumer drove us
headlong into the crisis

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.853
that we face today.

00:02:27.877 --> 00:02:34.154
The personal debt-to-income ratio
basically went from 65 to 135 percent

00:02:34.178 --> 00:02:36.686
in the span of about 15 years.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.797
So consumers got over-leveraged.

00:02:38.821 --> 00:02:42.002
And of course our banks did as well,
as did our federal government.

00:02:42.026 --> 00:02:44.092
This is an absolutely staggering chart.

00:02:44.116 --> 00:02:48.723
It shows leverage,
trended out from 1919 to 2009.

00:02:48.747 --> 00:02:51.399
And what you end up seeing
is the whole phenomenon

00:02:51.423 --> 00:02:55.279
that we are actually stepping forth
and basically leveraging

00:02:55.303 --> 00:02:58.482
future education, future children
in our households.

00:02:58.506 --> 00:03:01.606
So if you look at this in the context
of visualizing the bailout,

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.126
what you can see is,
if you stack up dollar bills,

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.392
first of all, 360,000 dollars

00:03:06.416 --> 00:03:08.935
is about the size of a five-foot-four guy.

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.236
But if you stack it up, you see
this amazing, staggering amount of dollars

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.126
that have been put into the system
to fund and bail us out.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.315
So this is the first 315 billion.

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:20.112
But I read this fact the other day,

00:03:20.136 --> 00:03:23.446
that one trillion seconds
equals 32,000 years.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.787
So if you think about that,

00:03:24.811 --> 00:03:27.307
the context, the casualness
with which we talk about

00:03:27.331 --> 00:03:29.584
trillion-dollar bailout here
and trillion there,

00:03:29.608 --> 00:03:32.993
we are stacking ourselves up
for long-term leverage.

00:03:33.017 --> 00:03:35.669
However, consumers have moved.

00:03:35.693 --> 00:03:37.732
They are taking responsibility.

00:03:37.756 --> 00:03:40.285
What we're seeing
is an uptake in the savings rate.

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:43.024
In fact, 11 straight months
of savings have happened

00:03:43.048 --> 00:03:44.695
since the beginning of the crisis.

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:47.083
We're working our way back up
to that 10 percent.

00:03:47.107 --> 00:03:49.037
Also, remarkably, in the fourth quarter,

00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:52.442
spending dropped
to its lowest level in 62 years --

00:03:52.466 --> 00:03:55.126
almost a 3.7 percent decline.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.030
Visa now reports that more people
are using debit cards than credit cards.

00:03:59.054 --> 00:04:02.447
So we're starting to pay for things
with money that we have.

00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:06.126
And we're starting to be much more careful
about how we save and invest.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.126
But that's not really the whole story,

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.067
because this has also been a dramatic
time of transformation.

00:04:11.091 --> 00:04:13.717
And you've got to admit,
over the last year and a half,

00:04:13.741 --> 00:04:15.809
consumers have been doing
some weird things.

00:04:15.833 --> 00:04:18.124
It's pretty staggering,
what we've lived through.

00:04:18.148 --> 00:04:20.844
If you take into account
that 80 percent of all Americans

00:04:20.868 --> 00:04:22.264
were born after World War II,

00:04:22.288 --> 00:04:24.021
this was essentially our Depression.

00:04:24.045 --> 00:04:26.850
And so, as a result,
some crazy things have happened.

00:04:26.874 --> 00:04:28.224
I'll give you some examples.

00:04:28.248 --> 00:04:32.913
Let's talk about dentists, vasectomies,
guns and shark attacks.

00:04:32.937 --> 00:04:34.725
(Laughter)

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:38.632
Dentists report molars --
people grinding their teeth,

00:04:38.656 --> 00:04:41.019
coming in and reporting
that they've had stress.

00:04:41.043 --> 00:04:44.465
So there's an increase in people
having to have their fillings replaced.

00:04:44.489 --> 00:04:47.783
Gun sales, according to the FBI,
who does background checks,

00:04:47.807 --> 00:04:50.901
are up almost 25 percent since January.

00:04:50.925 --> 00:04:55.578
Vasectomies are up 48 percent,
according to the Cornell Institute.

00:04:55.602 --> 00:04:58.006
And lastly, but a very good point,

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.606
hopefully not related
to the former point I just made,

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.093
which is that shark attacks
are at their lowest level from 2003.

00:05:04.117 --> 00:05:05.638
Does anybody know why?

00:05:06.011 --> 00:05:07.193
(Laughter)

00:05:07.217 --> 00:05:08.385
No one's at the beach.

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:10.305
So there's a bright side to everything.

00:05:10.329 --> 00:05:12.515
But seriously, what we see happening,

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:15.800
and the reason I want to stress
that the consumer is not in retreat,

00:05:15.824 --> 00:05:17.839
is that this is a tremendous opportunity

00:05:17.863 --> 00:05:20.457
for the consumer who drove us
into this recession

00:05:20.481 --> 00:05:22.006
to lead us right back out.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.372
What I mean by that is we can
move from mindless consumption

00:05:25.396 --> 00:05:27.424
to mindful consumption.

00:05:27.448 --> 00:05:28.608
Right?

00:05:28.632 --> 00:05:29.707
(Applause)

00:05:29.731 --> 00:05:31.763
If you think about the last three decades,

00:05:31.787 --> 00:05:35.069
the consumer has moved
from savvy about marketing in the '90s,

00:05:35.093 --> 00:05:39.070
to gathering all these amazing social
and search tools in this decade.

00:05:39.094 --> 00:05:42.423
But the one thing holding them back
is the ability to discriminate.

00:05:42.447 --> 00:05:43.784
By restricting their demand,

00:05:43.808 --> 00:05:47.126
consumers can actually align
their values with their spending,

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.730
and drive capitalism and business
to not just be about more,

00:05:50.754 --> 00:05:51.920
but to be about better.

00:05:51.944 --> 00:05:53.921
We're going to explain that right now.

00:05:53.945 --> 00:05:56.726
Based on Y&amp;R's BrandAsset Valuator,

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.451
proprietary tool of VML
and Young &amp; Rubicam,

00:05:59.475 --> 00:06:02.359
we set out to understand
what's been happening in the crisis

00:06:02.383 --> 00:06:03.924
with the consumer marketplace.

00:06:03.948 --> 00:06:06.165
We found a couple
of really interesting things.

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:08.616
We're going to go
through four value shifts

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.976
that we see driving
new consumer behaviors,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.057
that offer new management principles.

00:06:13.081 --> 00:06:14.891
The first cultural value shift we see

00:06:14.915 --> 00:06:17.541
is this tendency toward something
we call "liquid life."

00:06:17.565 --> 00:06:18.715
This is the movement

00:06:18.739 --> 00:06:21.820
from Americans defining
their success on having things

00:06:21.844 --> 00:06:23.126
to having liquidity,

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.842
because the less excess
that you have around you,

00:06:25.866 --> 00:06:28.018
the more nimble and fleet of foot you are.

00:06:28.042 --> 00:06:30.512
As a result, déclassé consumption is in.

00:06:30.536 --> 00:06:34.471
Déclassé consumption is the whole idea
that spending money frivolously

00:06:34.495 --> 00:06:37.233
makes you look a little bit anti-fashion.

00:06:37.257 --> 00:06:39.746
The management principle
is dollars and cents.

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.614
So let's look at some examples
of this déclassé consumption

00:06:42.638 --> 00:06:44.066
that falls out of this value.

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.387
The first thing is,
something must be happening

00:06:46.411 --> 00:06:48.487
when P. Diddy vows to tone down his bling.

00:06:48.511 --> 00:06:49.525
(Laughter)

00:06:49.549 --> 00:06:51.891
But seriously, we also have
this phenomenon

00:06:51.915 --> 00:06:53.840
on Madison Avenue and in other places,

00:06:53.864 --> 00:06:56.787
where people are actually
walking out of luxury boutiques

00:06:56.811 --> 00:07:00.624
with ordinary, generic paper bags
to hide the brand purchases.

00:07:00.648 --> 00:07:03.625
We see high-end haggling in fashion today,

00:07:03.649 --> 00:07:06.126
high-end haggling
for luxury and real estate.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.522
We also see just a relaxing of ego,

00:07:08.546 --> 00:07:10.798
and sort of a dismantling of artifice.

00:07:10.822 --> 00:07:14.669
This is a story on the yacht club
that's all basically blue collar.

00:07:14.693 --> 00:07:16.867
Blue-collar yacht club --
where you can join,

00:07:16.891 --> 00:07:20.126
but you've got to work in the boatyard
as condition of membership.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:24.811
We also see the trend toward tourism
that's a little bit more low-key:

00:07:24.835 --> 00:07:27.962
agritourism -- going to vineyards
and going to farms.

00:07:27.986 --> 00:07:31.611
And then we also see this movement
forward from dollars and cents.

00:07:31.635 --> 00:07:34.350
What businesses can do to connect
with these new mindsets

00:07:34.374 --> 00:07:35.541
is really interesting.

00:07:35.565 --> 00:07:37.410
A couple things that are kind of cool.

00:07:37.434 --> 00:07:41.127
One is that Frito-Lay figured out
this liquidity thing with their consumer.

00:07:41.151 --> 00:07:44.554
They found their consumer had more
money at the beginning of the month,

00:07:44.578 --> 00:07:45.987
less at the end of the month.

00:07:46.011 --> 00:07:48.024
So they started to change their packaging:

00:07:48.048 --> 00:07:50.070
larger packs at the beginning
of the month,

00:07:50.094 --> 00:07:52.114
smaller packaging at the end of the month.

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:54.857
Really interestingly, too,
was the San Francisco Giants.

00:07:54.881 --> 00:07:57.126
They've just instituted dynamic pricing.

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:00.369
It takes into account everything
from the pitcher match-ups,

00:08:00.393 --> 00:08:02.236
to the weather, to the team records,

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.664
in setting prices for the consumer.

00:08:04.688 --> 00:08:09.719
Another quick example of these types
of movements is the rise of Zynga.

00:08:09.743 --> 00:08:12.023
Zynga has risen on the consumer's desire

00:08:12.047 --> 00:08:14.059
to not want to be locked in to fixed cost.

00:08:14.083 --> 00:08:16.843
Again, this theme is about variable
cost, variable living.

00:08:16.867 --> 00:08:18.739
So micro-payments have become huge.

00:08:18.763 --> 00:08:21.342
And lastly, some people are using Hulu

00:08:21.366 --> 00:08:23.438
as a device to get rid
of their cable bill.

00:08:23.462 --> 00:08:27.052
So, really clever ideas there
that are being taken ahold of

00:08:27.076 --> 00:08:29.247
and that marketers
are starting to understand.

00:08:29.271 --> 00:08:31.901
The second of the four values
is this movement toward

00:08:31.925 --> 00:08:33.230
ethics and fair play.

00:08:33.254 --> 00:08:36.391
We see that play itself out
with empathy and respect.

00:08:36.415 --> 00:08:38.036
The consumer is demanding it.

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:41.226
And, as a result, businesses
must provide not only value,

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:42.402
but values.

00:08:42.426 --> 00:08:45.599
Increasingly, consumers are looking
at the culture of the company,

00:08:45.623 --> 00:08:47.368
at their conduct in the marketplace.

00:08:47.392 --> 00:08:49.060
So we see with empathy and respect

00:08:49.084 --> 00:08:51.880
lots of really hopeful things
come out of this recession.

00:08:51.904 --> 00:08:53.295
I'll give you a few examples.

00:08:53.319 --> 00:08:55.844
One is the rise toward communities
and neighborhoods,

00:08:55.868 --> 00:08:59.582
and increased emphasis on your neighbors
as your support system.

00:08:59.606 --> 00:09:03.653
Also, a wonderful by-product
of a really lousy thing,

00:09:03.677 --> 00:09:05.045
which has been unemployment,

00:09:05.069 --> 00:09:07.870
is a rise in volunteerism
that's been noted in our country.

00:09:07.894 --> 00:09:11.564
We also see the phenomenon --
some of you may have "boomerang kids" --

00:09:11.588 --> 00:09:13.225
these are "boomerang alumni,"

00:09:13.249 --> 00:09:15.982
where universities are actually
reconnecting with alumni

00:09:16.006 --> 00:09:18.787
and helping them with jobs,
sharing skills and retraining.

00:09:18.811 --> 00:09:21.359
We also talked about character
and professionalism.

00:09:21.383 --> 00:09:25.126
We had this miracle on the Hudson
in New York City in January,

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:29.126
and suddenly Sully has become
a key name on BabyCenter.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:30.220
(Laughter)

00:09:30.244 --> 00:09:32.640
So, from a value and values standpoint,

00:09:32.664 --> 00:09:35.617
what companies can do is connect
in lots of different ways.

00:09:35.641 --> 00:09:37.533
Microsoft is doing something wonderful.

00:09:37.557 --> 00:09:41.395
They are actually vowing to retrain
two million Americans with IT training,

00:09:41.419 --> 00:09:44.521
using their existing infrastructure
to do something good.

00:09:44.545 --> 00:09:47.006
Also, a really interesting
company is GORE-TEX.

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:49.740
GORE-TEX is all about
personal accountability

00:09:49.764 --> 00:09:51.713
of their management and their employees,

00:09:51.737 --> 00:09:55.295
to the point where they really
kind of shun the idea of bosses.

00:09:55.319 --> 00:09:58.084
But they also talk about the fact
that their executives --

00:09:58.108 --> 00:10:01.180
all of their expense reports
are put onto their company intranet

00:10:01.204 --> 00:10:02.383
for everyone to see.

00:10:02.407 --> 00:10:04.126
Complete transparency.

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:06.426
Think twice before you have
that bottle of wine.

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:07.507
(Laughter)

00:10:07.531 --> 00:10:10.304
The third of the four laws
of post-crisis consumerism

00:10:10.328 --> 00:10:11.813
is about durable living.

00:10:11.837 --> 00:10:14.374
We're seeing in our data
that consumers are realizing

00:10:14.398 --> 00:10:16.126
this is a marathon, not a sprint.

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:19.009
They're digging in and looking
for ways to extract value

00:10:19.033 --> 00:10:21.126
out of every purchase they make.

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:24.065
Witness the fact that Americans
are holding on to their cars

00:10:24.089 --> 00:10:27.951
longer than ever before:
9.4 years on average, in March.

00:10:27.975 --> 00:10:29.126
A record.

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:33.126
We also see the fact that libraries
have become a huge resource for America.

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:36.992
Did you know that 68 percent
of Americans now carry a library card?

00:10:37.016 --> 00:10:39.481
The highest percentage ever
in our nation's history.

00:10:39.505 --> 00:10:43.126
So what you see in this trend
is also the accumulation of knowledge.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:44.869
Continuing education is up.

00:10:44.893 --> 00:10:47.531
Everything is focused
on betterment, training,

00:10:47.555 --> 00:10:49.340
development and moving forward.

00:10:49.364 --> 00:10:51.901
We also see a big DIY movement.

00:10:52.424 --> 00:10:56.588
I was fascinated to learn that 30 percent
of all homes in America

00:10:56.612 --> 00:10:58.126
are actually built by owners.

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:00.008
That includes cottages and the like,

00:11:00.032 --> 00:11:01.200
but 30 percent.

00:11:01.224 --> 00:11:04.236
People are getting their hands dirty,
rolling up their sleeves.

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:05.427
They want these skills.

00:11:05.451 --> 00:11:09.015
We see it with the phenomenon of raising
backyard hens, chickens and ducks.

00:11:09.039 --> 00:11:11.727
And when you work out the math,
they say it doesn't work,

00:11:11.751 --> 00:11:13.051
but the principle is there;

00:11:13.075 --> 00:11:15.790
it's about being sustainable
and taking care of yourself.

00:11:15.814 --> 00:11:18.425
Then we look at the High Line
in New York City,

00:11:18.449 --> 00:11:21.217
an excellent use of reimagining
existing infrastructure

00:11:21.241 --> 00:11:22.400
for something good,

00:11:22.424 --> 00:11:24.459
which is a brand-new park
in New York City.

00:11:24.483 --> 00:11:28.574
So what brands can do, and companies,
is pay dividends to consumers,

00:11:28.598 --> 00:11:30.126
be a brand that lasts,

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:31.539
offer transparency,

00:11:31.563 --> 00:11:34.057
promise you're going to be there
beyond today's sale.

00:11:34.081 --> 00:11:36.126
Perfect example of that is Patagonia.

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:37.864
Patagonia's "Footprint Chronicles"

00:11:37.888 --> 00:11:41.686
basically goes through and tracks
every product they make,

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:43.500
and gives you social responsibility,

00:11:43.524 --> 00:11:47.063
and helps you understand the ethics
behind the product they make.

00:11:47.087 --> 00:11:48.869
Another great example is Fidelity.

00:11:48.893 --> 00:11:52.579
Rather than instant cash-back rewards
on your credit or debit purchases,

00:11:52.603 --> 00:11:57.499
this is about 529 rewards
for your student education.

00:11:57.523 --> 00:11:59.610
Or the interesting company Sunrun.

00:11:59.634 --> 00:12:00.789
I love this company.

00:12:00.813 --> 00:12:02.880
They've created a consumer collective

00:12:02.904 --> 00:12:05.250
where they put solar panels on households

00:12:05.274 --> 00:12:07.369
and create a consumer-based utility,

00:12:07.393 --> 00:12:09.091
where the electricity they generate

00:12:09.115 --> 00:12:11.739
is basically pumped back out
into the marketplace.

00:12:11.763 --> 00:12:13.499
So it's a consumer-driven co-op.

00:12:13.523 --> 00:12:17.197
The fourth post-crisis
consumerism that we see

00:12:17.221 --> 00:12:19.538
is this movement
about "return to the fold."

00:12:19.562 --> 00:12:21.361
It's incredibly important right now.

00:12:21.385 --> 00:12:23.969
Trust is not parceled out, as we all know.

00:12:23.993 --> 00:12:26.185
It's now about connecting
to your communities,

00:12:26.209 --> 00:12:27.971
connecting to your social networks.

00:12:27.995 --> 00:12:29.709
In my book, I talked about the fact

00:12:29.733 --> 00:12:32.408
that 72 percent of people trust
what other people say

00:12:32.432 --> 00:12:33.883
about a brand or a company,

00:12:33.907 --> 00:12:35.949
versus 15 percent on advertising.

00:12:35.973 --> 00:12:39.693
So in that respect, cooperative
consumerism has really taken off.

00:12:39.717 --> 00:12:42.700
This is about consumers working
together to get what they want

00:12:42.724 --> 00:12:43.900
out of the marketplace.

00:12:43.924 --> 00:12:45.901
Let's look at a couple of quick examples.

00:12:45.925 --> 00:12:47.498
The artisanal movement is huge:

00:12:47.522 --> 00:12:50.579
everything about locally
derived products and services,

00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:52.387
supporting your local neighborhoods,

00:12:52.411 --> 00:12:55.387
whether it's cheeses,
wines and other products.

00:12:55.411 --> 00:12:58.069
Also this rise of local currencies.

00:12:58.093 --> 00:13:01.068
Realizing that it's difficult
to get loans in this environment,

00:13:01.092 --> 00:13:03.151
you're doing business
with people you trust

00:13:03.175 --> 00:13:04.354
in your local markets.

00:13:04.378 --> 00:13:08.246
So this rise of local currency
is another really interesting phenomenon.

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:11.892
And then they did a recent report
I thought was fascinating.

00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:15.089
They actually started, in certain
communities in the United States,

00:13:15.113 --> 00:13:17.140
to publish people's electricity usage.

00:13:17.164 --> 00:13:20.475
And what they found out is when
that was available for public record,

00:13:20.499 --> 00:13:23.569
the people's electricity usage
in those communities dropped.

00:13:24.511 --> 00:13:27.126
Then we also look
at the idea of cow-pooling,

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:31.345
which is the whole phenomenon
of consumers organizing together

00:13:31.369 --> 00:13:35.262
to buy meat from organic farms,
that they know is safe and controlled

00:13:35.286 --> 00:13:37.472
in the way that they want it
to be controlled.

00:13:37.496 --> 00:13:41.063
And then there's this other really
interesting movement in California,

00:13:41.087 --> 00:13:42.570
which is about carrot mobs.

00:13:42.594 --> 00:13:45.640
The traditional thing would be
to boycott, right? Have a stick.

00:13:45.664 --> 00:13:47.010
Well, why not have a carrot?

00:13:47.034 --> 00:13:50.338
So these are consumers organizing,
pooling their resources

00:13:50.362 --> 00:13:53.126
to incentify companies to do good.

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:55.947
And then we look at what companies can do.

00:13:55.971 --> 00:13:59.424
This is all the opportunity
about being a community organizer.

00:13:59.448 --> 00:14:02.415
You have to realize
that you can't fight and control this.

00:14:02.439 --> 00:14:04.049
You actually need to organize it.

00:14:04.073 --> 00:14:06.598
You need to harness it.
You need to give it meaning.

00:14:06.622 --> 00:14:09.834
And there's lots of really
interesting examples here.

00:14:09.858 --> 00:14:14.651
First is just the rise of the fact
that Zagat's has actually moved out of

00:14:14.675 --> 00:14:16.903
and diversified from rating restaurants,

00:14:16.927 --> 00:14:19.126
into actually rating health care.

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:21.279
So what credentials does Zagat's have?

00:14:21.303 --> 00:14:22.473
Well, they have a lot,

00:14:22.497 --> 00:14:24.341
because it's their network of people.

00:14:24.365 --> 00:14:26.908
So that becomes
a very powerful force for them

00:14:26.932 --> 00:14:29.126
to make their brand more elastic.

00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:31.407
Then you look at the phenomenon of Kogi.

00:14:31.936 --> 00:14:34.913
This Kogi doesn't exist.
It's a moving truck.

00:14:34.937 --> 00:14:36.536
It's a moving truck through L.A.,

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:39.056
and the only way you can find it
is through Twitter.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.137
(Laughter)

00:14:40.161 --> 00:14:41.314
Or you look at

00:14:41.338 --> 00:14:46.400
Johnson &amp; Johnson's "Momversations,"
a phenomenal blog that's been built up,

00:14:46.424 --> 00:14:50.554
where J&amp;J basically is tapping
into the power of mommy bloggers,

00:14:50.578 --> 00:14:55.026
allowing them to create a forum
where they can communicate and connect.

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:59.889
And it's also become a very valuable
advertising revenue for J&amp;J as well.

00:14:59.913 --> 00:15:04.127
This, plus the fact that you've got
phenomenal work from CEOs,

00:15:04.151 --> 00:15:06.691
from Ford to Zappos,
connecting on Twitter,

00:15:06.715 --> 00:15:08.126
creating an open environment,

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:11.188
allowing their employees
to be part of the process,

00:15:11.212 --> 00:15:12.920
rather than hidden behind walls.

00:15:12.944 --> 00:15:17.149
You see this rising force
in total transparency and openness

00:15:17.173 --> 00:15:18.961
that companies are starting to adopt,

00:15:18.985 --> 00:15:21.292
all because the consumer is demanding it.

00:15:21.316 --> 00:15:23.262
So when we look at this and step back,

00:15:23.286 --> 00:15:27.478
what I believe is that the crisis
that exists today is definitely real.

00:15:27.502 --> 00:15:30.126
It's been tremendously
powerful for consumers.

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:33.713
But at the same time,
this is also a tremendous opportunity.

00:15:33.737 --> 00:15:37.204
The Chinese character for crisis
is actually the same side

00:15:37.228 --> 00:15:38.395
of the same coin.

00:15:38.419 --> 00:15:40.126
Crisis equals opportunity.

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:43.644
What we're seeing with consumers
right now is the ability for them

00:15:43.668 --> 00:15:46.304
to actually lead us forward
out of this recession.

00:15:46.328 --> 00:15:51.126
So we believe that values-driven spending
will force capitalism to be better:

00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:53.030
it will drive innovation;

00:15:53.054 --> 00:15:55.155
it will make longer-lasting products;

00:15:55.179 --> 00:15:57.775
it will create better,
more intuitive customer service;

00:15:57.799 --> 00:16:00.676
and it will give us the opportunity
to connect with companies

00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:02.771
that share the values that we share.

00:16:02.795 --> 00:16:04.814
So when we look back and step out at this

00:16:04.838 --> 00:16:08.126
and see the beginning of these trends
that we're seeing in our data,

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:10.999
we see a very hopeful picture
for the future of America.

00:16:11.023 --> 00:16:12.191
Thank you very much.

00:16:12.215 --> 00:16:14.031
(Applause)
