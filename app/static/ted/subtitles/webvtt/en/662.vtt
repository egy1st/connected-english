00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
One of the biggest challenges in computer graphics

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
has been being able to create a photo-real,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
digital human face.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And one of the reasons it is so difficult is that, unlike aliens and dinosaurs,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
we look at human faces every day.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
They are very important to how we communicate with each other.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
As a result, we're tuned in to the subtlest things

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that could possibly be wrong with a computer rendering,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
in order to believe whether these things are realistic.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And what I'm going to do in the next five minutes

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
is take you through a process

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
where we tried to create a reasonably photo-realistic computer-generated face,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
using some computer graphics technology we've developed,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and also some collaborators at a company called Image Metrics.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And we're going to try to do a photo-real face

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
of an actress named Emily O'Brien, who is right there.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And that's actually a completely computer-generated rendering of her face.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
By the end of the talk, we're going to see it move.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
The way that we did this is we tried to start with Emily herself,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
who was gracious enough to come to our laboratory

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
in Marina Del Rey, and sit for a session in Light Stage 5.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
This is a face-scanning sphere, with 156 white LEDs all around

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
that allow us to photograph her

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
in a series of very controlled illumination conditions.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And the lighting that we use these days looks something like this.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
We shoot all of these photographs in about three seconds.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And we basically capture enough information

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
with video projector patterns that drape over the contours of her face,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and different principle directions of light from the light stage,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
to figure out both the coarse-scale

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and the fine-scale detail of her face.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
If we zoom in on this photograph right here,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
we can see it's a really nice photograph to have of her,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
because she is lit from absolutely everywhere at the same time

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
to get a nice image of her facial texture.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And in addition, we've actually used polarizers on all the lights --

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
just like polarized sunglasses can block

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
the glare off of the road,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
polarizers can block the shine off of the skin,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
so we don't get all those specular reflections to take this map.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Now, if we turn the polarizers around just a little bit,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
we can actually bring that specular reflection

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
of the skin back in,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and you can see she looks kind of shiny and oily at this point.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
If you take the difference between these two images here,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
you can get an image lit from the entire sphere of light

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
of just the shine off of Emily's skin.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I don't think any photograph like this had ever been taken

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
before we had done this.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And this is very important light to capture,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
because this is the light that reflects off the first surface of the skin.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
It doesn't get underneath the translucent

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
layers of the skin and blur out.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And, as a result, it's a very good cue

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
to the detailed shape of the skin-pore structure

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and all of the fine wrinkles that all of us have,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
the things that actually make us look like real humans.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
So, if we use information that comes off of this specular reflection,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
we can go from a traditional face scan

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
that might have the gross contours of the face and the basic shape,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
and augment it with information

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
that puts in all of that skin pore structure and fine wrinkles.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And, even more importantly,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
since this is a photometric process that only takes three seconds to capture,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
we can shoot Emily

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
in just part of an afternoon,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
in many different facial poses and facial expressions.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
So, here you can see her moving her eyes around, moving her mouth around.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And these we're actually going to use to create a photo-real digital character.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
If you take a look at these scans that we have of Emily,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
you can see that the human face does an enormous amount of amazing things

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
as it goes into different facial expressions.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
You can see things. Not only the face shape changes,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
but all sorts of different skin buckling and skin wrinkling occurs.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
You can see that the skin pore structure changes enormously

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
from stretched skin pores

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
to the regular skin texture.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
You can see the furrows in the brow and how the microstructure changes there.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
You can see muscles pulling down at flesh to bring her eyebrows down.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Her muscles bulging in her forehead when she winces like that.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
In addition to this kind of high-resolution geometry,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
since it's all captured with cameras, we've got a great texture map to use for the face.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And by looking at how the different color channels of the illumination,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
the red and the green and the blue,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
diffuse the light differently,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
we can come up with a way of shading the skin on the computer.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Then, instead of looking like a plaster mannequin,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
it actually looks like it's made out of living human flesh.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And this is what we used

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
to give to the company Image Metrics

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
to create a rigged, digital version of Emily.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
We're just seeing the coarse-scale geometry here.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
But they basically created a digital puppet of her,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
where you can pull on these various strings,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
and it actually moves her face in ways that are

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
completely consistent with the scans that we took.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And, in addition to the coarse-scale geometry,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
they also used all of that detail

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
to create a set of what are called "displacement maps"

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
that animate as well.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
These are the displacement maps here.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
And you can see those different wrinkles actually show up as she animates.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
So the next process was then to animate her.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
We actually used one of her own performances to provide the source data.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
So, by analyzing this video with computer vision techniques,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
they were able to drive the facial rig

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
with the computer-generated performance.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
So what you're going to see now, after this,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
is a completely photo-real digital face.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
We can turn the volume up a little bit if that's available.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Emily: Image Metrics is a markerless, performance-driven animation company.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
We specialize in high-quality facial animation

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
for video games and films.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Image Metrics is a markerless, performance-driven animation company.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
We specialize in high quality facial animation

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
for video games and films.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Paul Debevec: So, if we break that down into layers, here's that diffuse component

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
we saw in the first slide.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Here is the specular component animating.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
You can see all the wrinkles happening there.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000
And there is the underlying wireframe mesh.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
And that is Emily herself.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Now, where are we going with this here?

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
We've gone a little bit beyond Light Stage 5. This is Light Stage 6,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
and we're looking at taking this technology

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
and applying it to whole human bodies.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
This is Bruce Lawmen, one of our researchers in the group,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
who graciously agreed to get captured running in the Light Stage.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And let's take a look at a computer-generated version

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
of Bruce, running in a new environment.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And thank you very much.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000
(Applause)
