00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The magical moment, the magical moment of conducting.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Which is, you go onto a stage. There is an orchestra sitting.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
They are all, you know, warming up and doing stuff.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And I go on the podium.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
You know, this little office of the conductor.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Or rather a cubicle, an open-space cubicle,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
with a lot of space.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And in front of all that noise,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
you do a very small gesture.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Something like this, not very pomp, not very sophisticated, this.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And suddenly, out of the chaos, order.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Noise becomes music.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And this is fantastic. And it's so tempting

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
to think that it's all about me.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
(Laughter)

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
All those great people here, virtuosos,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
they make noise, they need me to do that.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Not really. If it were that,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I would just save you the talk,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and teach you the gesture.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So you could go out to the world

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and do this thing in whatever company or whatever you want,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and you have perfect harmony. It doesn't work.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Let's look at the first video.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I hope you'll think it's a good example of harmony.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And then speak a little bit about how it comes about.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
(Music)

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Was that nice?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
So that was a sort of a success.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Now, who should we thank for the success?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I mean, obviously the orchestra musicians

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
playing beautifully,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
They don't often even look at the conductor.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Then you have the clapping audience, yeah,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
actually taking part in doing the music.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
You know Viennese audiences usually don't interfere with the music.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
This is the closest to an Oriental bellydancing feast

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
that you will ever get in Vienna.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000
(Laughter)

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Unlike, for example Israel, where audiences cough all the time.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
You know, Arthur Rubinstein, the pianist, used to say

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
that, "Anywhere in the world, people that have the flu, they go to the doctor.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
In Tel Aviv they come to my concerts."

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
(Laughter)

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So that's a sort of a tradition.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
But Viennese audiences do not do that.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Here they go out of their regular, just to be part of that,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
to become part of the orchestra, and that's great.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
You know, audiences like you, yeah,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
make the event.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
But what about the conductor? What can you say

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
the conductor was doing, actually?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Um, he was happy.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And I often show this to senior management.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
People get annoyed.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
"You come to work. How come you're so happy?"

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Something must be wrong there, yeah? But he's spreading happiness.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And I think the happiness, the important thing is this happiness

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
does not come from

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
only his own story and his joy of the music.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
The joy is about enabling other people's stories

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
to be heard at the same time.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
You have the story of the orchestra as a professional body.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
You have the story of the audience as a community. Yeah.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
You have the stories of the individuals

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
in the orchestra and in the audience.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And then you have other stories, unseen.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
People who build this wonderful concert hall.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
People who made those Stradivarius, Amati, all those beautiful instruments.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And all those stories are being heard at the same time.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
This is the true experience of a live concert.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
That's a reason to go out of home. Yeah?

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
And not all conductors do just that.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Let's see somebody else, a great conductor.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Riccardo Muti, please.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
(Music)

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Yeah, that was very short, but you could see

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
it's a completely different figure. Right?

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
He's awesome. He's so commanding. Yeah?

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
So clear. Maybe a little bit over-clear.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Can we have a little demonstration? Would you be my orchestra for a second?

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Can you sing, please, the first note of Don Giovanni?

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
You have to sing "Aaaaaah," and I'll stop you.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Okay? Ready?

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Audience: ♫ Aaaaaaah ... ♫

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Itay Talgam: Come on, with me. If you do it without me

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
I feel even more redundant than I already feel.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
So please, wait for the conductor.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Now look at me. "Aaaaaah," and I stop you. Let's go.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Audience: ♫ ... Aaaaaaaah ... ♫

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
(Laughter)

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Itay Talgam: So we'll have a little chat later.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000
(Laughter)

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
But ... There is a vacancy for a ...

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
But -- (Laughter)

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
-- you could see that you could stop an orchestra with a finger.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Now what does Riccardo Muti do? He does something like this ...

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000
(Laughter)

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
And then -- sort of -- (Laughter)

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
So not only the instruction is clear,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
but also the sanction, what will happen if you don't do what I tell you.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
(Laughter)

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
So, does it work? Yes, it works --

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
to a certain point.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
When Muti is asked, "Why do you conduct like this?"

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
He says, "I'm responsible."

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Responsible in front of him.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
No he doesn't really mean Him. He means Mozart,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
which is -- (Laughter) -- like a third seat from the center.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000
(Laughter)

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
So he says, "If I'm --

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
(Applause)

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
if I'm responsible for Mozart,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
this is going to be the only story to be told.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
It's Mozart as I, Riccardo Muti, understand it."

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And you know what happened to Muti?

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Three years ago he got a letter signed by

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
all 700 employees of La Scala,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
musical employees, I mean the musicians,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
saying, "You're a great conductor. We don't want to work with you. Please resign."

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000
(Laughter)

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
"Why? Because you don't let us develop.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
You're using us as instruments, not as partners.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
And our joy of music, etc., etc. ..."

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
So he had to resign. Isn't that nice?

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
(Laughter)

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
He's a nice guy. He's a really nice guy.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Well, can you do it with less control,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
or with a different kind of control?

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Let's look at the next conductor, Richard Strauss.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
(Music)

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
I'm afraid you'll get the feeling that I really picked on him because he's old.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
It's not true. When he was a young man

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
of about 30, he wrote what he called

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
"The Ten Commandments for Conductors."

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
The first one was: If you sweat by the end of the concert

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
it means that you must have done something wrong.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
That's the first one. The fourth one you'll like better.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
It says: Never look at the trombones --

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
it only encourages them.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
(Laughter)

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
So, the whole idea is really to let

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
it happen by itself.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Do not interfere.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
But how does it happen? Did you see

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
him turning pages in the score?

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Now, either he is senile,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
and doesn't remember his own music, because he wrote the music.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Or he is actually transferring a very strong message to them, saying,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
"Come on guys. You have to play by the book.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
So it's not about my story. It's not about your story.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
It's only the execution of the written music,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
no interpretation."

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Interpretation is the real story of the performer.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
So, no, he doesn't want that. That's a different kind of control.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Let's see another super-conductor,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
a German super-conductor. Herbert von Karajan, please.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
(Music)

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
What's different? Did you see the eyes? Closed.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Did you see the hands?

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Did you see this kind of movement? Let me conduct you. Twice.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Once like a Muti, and you'll -- (Claps) -- clap, just once.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And then like Karajan. Let's see what happens. Okay?

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Like Muti. You ready? Because Muti ...

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
(Laughter) Okay? Ready? Let's do it.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Audience: (Claps)

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Itay Talgam: Hmm ... again.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Audience: (Claps)

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Itay Talgam: Good. Now like a Karajan. Since you're already trained,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
let me concentrate, close my eyes. Come, come.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Audience: (Claps) (Laughter)

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Itay Talgam: Why not together? (Laughter)

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Because you didn't know when to play.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Now I can tell you, even the Berlin Philharmonic

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
doesn't know when to play.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000
(Laughter)

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
But I'll tell you how they do it. No cynicism.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
This is a German orchestra, yes?

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
They look at Karajan. And then they look at each other.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
(Laughter)

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
"Do you understand what this guy wants?"

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
And after doing that,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
they really look at each other, and the first players of the orchestra

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
lead the whole ensemble in playing together.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
And when Karajan is asked about it

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
he actually says, "Yes, the worst damage

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
I can do to my orchestra

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
is to give them a clear instruction.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Because that would

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
prevent the ensemble, the listening to each other

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
that is needed for an orchestra."

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Now that's great. What about the eyes?

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Why are the eyes closed?

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
There is a wonderful story about Karajan conducting in London.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
And he cues in a flute player like this.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
The guy has no idea what to do. (Laughter)

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
"Maestro, with all due respect, when should I start?"

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
What do you think Karajan's reply was? When should I start?

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Oh yeah. He says, "You start when you can't stand it anymore."

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
(Laughter)

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Meaning that you know you have no authority to change anything.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
It's my music. The real music is only in Karajan's head.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And you have to guess my mind. So you are under tremendous pressure

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
because I don't give you instruction,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
and yet, you have to guess my mind.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
So it's a different kind of, a very spiritual but yet

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
very firm control.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Can we do it in another way? Of course we can. Let's go back

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
to the first conductor we've seen:

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Carlos Kleiber, his name. Next video, please.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
(Music)

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
(Laughter) Yeah.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Well, it is different. But isn't that controlling in the same way?

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
No, it's not, because he is not telling them what to do.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
When he does this, it's not,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
"Take your Stradivarius and like Jimi Hendrix,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
smash it on the floor." It's not that.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
He says, "This is the gesture of the music.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
I'm opening a space for you

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
to put in another layer

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
of interpretation."

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
That is another story.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
But how does it really work together

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
if it doesn't give them instructions?

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
It's like being on a rollercoaster. Yeah?

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
You're not really given any instructions,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
but the forces of the process itself keep you in place.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
That's what he does.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
The interesting thing is of course the rollercoaster does not really exist.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
It's not a physical thing. It's in the players' heads.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
And that's what makes them into partners.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
You have the plan in your head.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
You know what to do, even though Kleiber is not conducting you.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
But here and there and that. You know what to do.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
And you become a partner building the rollercoaster,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
yeah, with sound,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
as you actually take the ride.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
This is very exciting for those players.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
They do need to go to a sanatorium for two weeks, later.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000
(Laughter)

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
It is very tiring. Yeah?

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
But it's the best music making, like this.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
But of course it's not only about motivation

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
and giving them a lot of physical energy.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
You also have to be very professional.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
And look again at this Kleiber.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Can we have the next video, quickly?

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
You'll see what happens when there is a mistake.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
(Music) Again you see the beautiful body language.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
(Music)

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
And now there is a trumpet player who

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
does something not exactly the way it should be done.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Go along with the video. Look.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
See, second time for the same player.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
(Laughter) And now the third time for the same player.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000
(Laughter)

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
"Wait for me after the concert.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
I have a short notice to give you."

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
You know, when it's needed, the authority is there. It's very important.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
But authority is not enough to make people your partners.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Let's see the next video, please. See what happens here.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
You might be surprised having seen Kleiber

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
as such a hyperactive guy.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
He's conducting Mozart.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
(Music)

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
The whole orchestra is playing.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
(Music)

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Now something else.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
(Music)

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
See? He is there 100 percent,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
but not commanding, not telling what to do.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Rather enjoying what the soloist is doing.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
(Music)

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Another solo now. See what you can pick up from this.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
(Music)

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Look at the eyes.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Okay. You see that?

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
First of all, it's a kind of a compliment we all like to get.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
It's not feedback. It's an "Mmmm ..." Yeah, it comes from here.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
So that's a good thing.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
And the second thing is

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
it's about actually being in control,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
but in a very special way.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
When Kleiber does -- did you see the eyes,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
going from here? (Singing)

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
You know what happens? Gravitation is no more.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Kleiber not only creates a process,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
but also creates the conditions in the world

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
in which this process takes place.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
So again, the oboe player

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
is completely autonomous

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
and therefore happy and proud of his work,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
and creative and all of that.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
And the level in which Kleiber is in control is in a different level.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
So control is no longer a zero-sum game.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
You have this control. You have this control. And all you put together,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
in partnership, brings about the best music.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
So Kleiber is about process.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Kleiber is about conditions in the world.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000
But you need to have process and content to create the meaning.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Lenny Bernstein, my own personal maestro.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Since he was a great teacher,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Lenny Bernstein always started from the meaning. Look at this, please.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
(Music)

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Do you remember the face of Muti, at the beginning?

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Well he had a wonderful expression, but only one.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000
(Laughter)

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Did you see Lenny's face?

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000
You know why? Because the meaning of the music is pain.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
And you're playing a painful sound.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
And you look at Lenny and he's suffering.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
But not in a way that you want to stop.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000
It's suffering, like, enjoying himself in a Jewish way, as they say.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000
(Laughter)

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
But you can see the music on his face.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
You can see the baton left his hand. No more baton.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Now it's about you, the player,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
telling the story.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Now it's a reversed thing. You're telling the story. And you're telling the story.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
And even briefly, you become the storyteller

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
to which the community, the whole community, listens to.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000
And Bernstein enables that. Isn't that wonderful?

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Now, if you are doing all the things we talked about, together,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
and maybe some others,

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
you can get to this wonderful point of doing without doing.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000
And for the last video, I think this is simply the best title.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
My friend Peter says,

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000
"If you love something, give it away." So, please.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
(Music)

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:31.000
(Applause)
