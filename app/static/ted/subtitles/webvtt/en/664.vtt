00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Twenty-five-and-a-quarter years ago I read

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
a newspaper article which said

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
that one day syringes would be

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
one of the major causes of the spread of AIDS,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
the transmission of AIDS.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I thought this was unacceptable. So I decided to do something about it.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Sadly, it's come true. Malaria, as we all know,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
kills approximately one million people a year.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The reuse of syringes now exceeds that

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and kills 1.3 million people a year.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
This young girl and her friend

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
that I met in an orphanage in Delhi

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
were HIV positive from a syringe.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And what was so sad about this particular story

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
was that once their parents had found out --

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and don't forget, their parents took them to the doctor --

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
the parents threw them out on the street.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And hence they ended up in an orphanage.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And it comes from situations like this where

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
you have either skilled or unskilled practitioners,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
blindly giving an injection to someone.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And the injection is so valuable,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
that the people basically trust

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
the doctor, being second to God, which I've heard many times,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
to do the right thing. But in fact they're not.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And you can understand, obviously, the transmission problem

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
between people in high-virus areas.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
This video we took undercover,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
which shows you, over a half an hour period,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
a tray of medicines of 42 vials,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
which are being delivered with only 2 syringes in a public hospital in India.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And over the course of half an hour, not one syringe

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
was filmed being unwrapped.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
They started with two and they ended with two.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And you'll see, just now, a nurse coming back to the tray,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
which is their sort of modular station,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and dropping the syringe she's just used

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
back in the tray for it to be picked up and used again.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
So you can imagine the scale of this problem.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And in fact in India alone, 62 percent

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
of all injections given

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
are unsafe.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
These kids in Pakistan don't go to school.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
They are lucky. They already have a job.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And that job is that they go around and pick up syringes

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
from the back of hospitals,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
wash them, and in the course of this,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
obviously picking them up they injure themselves.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And then they repackage them and sell them out on markets

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
for literally more money

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
than a sterile syringe in the first place, which is quite bizarre.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
In an interesting photo, their father, while we were talking to him,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
picked up a syringe and pricked his finger --

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I don't know whether you can see the drop of blood on the end --

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and immediately whipped out a box of matches,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
lit one, and burned the blood off the end of his finger,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
giving me full assurance

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
that that was the way that you stopped the transmission of HIV.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
In China, recycling is a major issue.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And they are collected en mass -- you can see the scale of it here --

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and sorted out, by hand, back into the right sizes,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
and then put back out on the street.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
So recycling and reuse

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
are the major issues here.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
But there was one interesting anecdote that I found in Indonesia.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
In all schools in Indonesia,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
there is usually a toy seller in the playground.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
The toy seller, in this case,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
had syringes, which they usually do,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
next door to the diggers, which is obviously

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
what you would expect.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And they use them, in the breaks, for water pistols.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
They squirt them at each other, which is lovely and innocent.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
And they are having great fun.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
But they also drink from them

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
while they're in their breaks, because it's hot.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And they squirt the water into their mouths.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And these are used with traces of blood visible.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
So we need a better product. And we need better information.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
And I think, if I can just borrow this camera,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
I was going to show you my invention,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
which I came up with.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
So, it's a normal-looking syringe.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
You load it up in the normal way. This is made

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
on existing equipment in 14 factories that we license.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
You give the injection and then put it down.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
If someone then tries to reuse it,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
it locks and breaks afterwards.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
It's very, very simple. Thank you.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
(Applause)

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And it costs the same as a normal syringe.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And in comparison, a Coca-Cola

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
is 10 times the price.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
And that will stop reusing a syringe 20 or 30 times.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
And I have an information charity

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
which has done huge scale amount of work in India.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
And we're very proud of giving information to people,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
so that little kids like this don't do stupid things.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Thank you very much.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000
(Applause)
