00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The future, as we know it, is very unpredictable.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The best minds in the best institutions

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
generally get it wrong.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This is in technology. This is in the area of politics,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
where pundits, the CIA, MI6 always get it wrong.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And it's clearly in the area of finance.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
With institutions established to think about the future,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
the IMF, the BIS, the Financial Stability Forum, couldn't see what was coming.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Over 20,000 economists

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
whose job it is, competitive entry to get there,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
couldn't see what was happening.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Globalization is getting more complex.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And this change is getting more rapid.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The future will be more unpredictable.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Urbanization, integration,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
coming together, leads to a new renaissance.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
It did this a thousand years ago.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The last 40 years have been extraordinary times.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Life expectancy has gone up by about 25 years.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
It took from the Stone Age to achieve that.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Income has gone up for a majority of the world's population,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
despite the population going up by about two billion people over this period.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And illiteracy has gone down, from a half to about a quarter of the people on Earth.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
A huge opportunity, unleashing of new potential

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
for innovation, for development.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
But there is an underbelly.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
There are two Achilles' heels of globalization.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
There is the Achilles' heel of growing inequality --

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
those that are left out, those that feel angry,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
those that are not participating. Globalization

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
has not been inclusive.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
The second Achilles' heel is complexity --

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
a growing fragility, a growing brittleness.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
What happens in one place very quickly affects everything else.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
This is a systemic risk, systemic shock.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
We've seen it in the financial crisis. We've seen it in the pandemic flu.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
It will become virulent and it's something we have to build resilience against.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
A lot of this is driven by what's happening in technology.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
There have been huge leaps. There will be a million-fold improvement

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
in what you can get for the same price

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
in computing by 2030.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
That's what the experience of the last 20 years has been.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
It will continue.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Our computers, our systems will be as primitive

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
as the Apollo's are for today.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Our mobile phones are more powerful than the total Apollo space engine.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Our mobile phones are more powerful than

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
some of the strongest computers of 20 years ago.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
So what will this do?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
It will create huge opportunities in technology.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Miniaturization as well.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
There will be invisible capacity. Invisible capacity in our bodies,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
in our brains, and in the air.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
This is a dust mite on a nanoreplica.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
This sort of ability to do everything in new ways unleashes potential,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
not least in the area of medicine.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
This is a stem cell that we've developed here in Oxford,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
from an embryonic stem cell.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
We can develop any part of the body.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Increasingly, over time, this will be possible from our own skin --

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
able to replicate parts of the body.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Fantastic potential for regenerative medicine.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I don't think there will be a Special Olympics long after 2030,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
because of this capacity to regenerate parts of the body.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
But the question is, "Who will have it?"

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
The other major development is going to be

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
in the area of what can happen in genetics.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000
The capacity to create, as this mouse has been genetically modified,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
something which goes three times faster,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
lasts for three times longer, we could produce,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
as this mouse can, to the age of our equivalent of 80 years,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
using about the same amount of food.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
But will this only be available for the super rich,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
for those that can afford it? Are we headed for a new eugenics?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Will only those that are able to afford it

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
be able to be this super race of the future?

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000
(Laughter)

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
So the big question for us is,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
"How do we manage this technological change?"

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
How do we ensure that it creates

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
a more inclusive technology,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
a technology which means

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
that not only as we grow older,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
that we can also grow wiser, and that we're able to support

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
the populations of the future?

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
One of the most dramatic manifestations of these improvements

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
will be moving from population pyramids

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
to what we might term population coffins.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
There is unlikely to be a pension

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
or a retirement age in 2030.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
These will be redundant concepts. And this isn't only something of the West.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
The most dramatic changes will be the skyscraper

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
type of new pyramids

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
that will take place in China and in many other countries.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
So forget about retirements if you're young.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Forget about pensions. Think about life and where it's going to be going.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Of course, migration will become even more important.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
The war on talent, the need to attract people

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
at all skill ranges,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
to push us around in our wheelchairs,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
but also to drive our economies. Our innovation will be vital.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
The employment in the rich countries

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
will go down from about 800

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
to about 700 million of these people.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
This would imply a massive leap in migration.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
So the concerns, the xenophobic concerns of today,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
of migration, will be turned on their head,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
as we search for people to help us sort out

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
our pensions and our economies in the future.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
And then, the systemic risks.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
We understand that these will become much more virulent,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
that what we see today

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
is this interweaving of societies, of systems,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
fastened by technologies and hastened by just-in-time management systems.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Small levels of stock push resilience into other people's responsibility.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
The collapse in biodiversity,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
climate change, pandemics, financial crises:

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
these will be the currency that we will think about.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
And so a new awareness will have to arise,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
of how we deal with these, how we mobilize ourselves,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
in a new way, and come together as a community

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
to manage systemic risk.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
It's going to require innovation.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
It's going to require an understanding that the glory of globalization

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
could also be its downfall.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
This could be our best century ever because of the achievements,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
or it could be our worst.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And of course we need to worry about the individuals,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
particularly the individuals that feel that they've

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
been left out in one way or another.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
An individual, for the first time in the history of humanity,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
will have the capacity, by 2030,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
to destroy the planet, to wreck everything,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
through the creation, for example, of a biopathogen.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
How do we begin to weave these tapestries together?

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
How do we think about complex systems in new ways?

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
That will be the challenge of the scholars,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
and of all of us engaged in thinking about the future.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
The rest of our lives will be in the future. We need to prepare for it now.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
We need to understand that the governance structure in the world is fossilized.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
It cannot begin to cope with the challenges that this will bring.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
We have to develop a new way of managing the planet,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
collectively, through collective wisdom.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
We know, and I know from my own experience,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
that amazing things can happen,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
when individuals and societies come together

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
to change their future.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
I left South Africa, and 15 years later,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
after thinking I would never go back,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
I had the privilege and the honor to work in the government of Nelson Mandela.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
This was a miracle. We can create miracles,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
collectively, in our lifetime.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
It is vital that we do so.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
It is vital that the ideas that are nurtured in TED,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
that the ideas that we think about

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
look forward, and make sure that this will be the most glorious century,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
and not one of eco-disaster and eco-collapse.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Thank you. (Applause)
