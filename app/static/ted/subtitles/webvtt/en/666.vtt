00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm sure that, throughout the hundred-thousand-odd years

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
of our species' existence,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and even before,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
our ancestors looked up at the night sky,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and wondered what stars are.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Wondering, therefore,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
how to explain what they saw

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
in terms of things unseen.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Okay, so, most people

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
only wondered that occasionally, like today,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
in breaks from whatever

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
normally preoccupied them.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
But what normally preoccupied them

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
also involved yearning to know.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
They wished they knew

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
how to prevent their food supply

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
from sometimes failing,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and how they could rest when they were tired

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
without risking starvation,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
be warmer, cooler, safer,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
in less pain.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I bet those prehistoric cave artists

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
would have loved to know

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
how to draw better.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
In every aspect of their lives,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
they wished for progress, just as we do.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
But they failed, almost completely, to make any.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
They didn't know how to.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Discoveries like fire

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
happened so rarely, that from an individual's point of view,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
the world never improved.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Nothing new was learned.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
The first clue to the origin of starlight

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000
happened as recently as 1899: radioactivity.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Within 40 years,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
physicists discovered the whole explanation,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
expressed, as usual, in elegant symbols.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
But never mind the symbols.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Think how many discoveries

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
they represent.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Nuclei and nuclear reactions, of course.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
But isotopes, particles of electricity,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
antimatter,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
neutrinos,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
the conversion of mass to energy -- that's E=mc^2 --

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
gamma rays,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
transmutation.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
That ancient dream that had always eluded the alchemists

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
was achieved through these same theories

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
that explained starlight

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and other ancient mysteries,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and new, unexpected phenomena.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
That all that, discovered in 40 years,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
had not been in the previous hundred thousand,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
was not for lack of thinking

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
about stars, and all those other urgent problems they had.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
They even arrived at answers,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
such as myths,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
that dominated their lives,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
yet bore almost no resemblance

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
to the truth.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
The tragedy of that protracted stagnation

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
isn't sufficiently recognized, I think.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
These were people with brains of

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
essentially the same design

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
that eventually did discover all those things.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
But that ability to make progress

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
remained almost unused,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
until the event that

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
revolutionized the human condition

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and changed the universe.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Or so we should hope.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Because that event was the

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Scientific Revolution,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
ever since which our knowledge

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
of the physical world,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and of how to adapt it to our wishes,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
has been growing relentlessly.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Now, what had changed?

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
What were people now doing for the first time

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
that made that difference

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
between stagnation

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
and rapid, open-ended discovery?

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
How to make that difference

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
is surely the most important universal truth

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
that it is possible to know.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Worryingly, there is no consensus about what it is.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
So, I'll tell you.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
But I'll have to backtrack a little first.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Before the Scientific Revolution,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
they believed that everything important, knowable,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
was already known,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
enshrined in ancient writings, institutions,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
and in some genuinely useful rules of thumb --

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
which were, however, entrenched as dogmas,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
along with many falsehoods.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
So they believed that knowledge came from authorities

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
that actually knew very little.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
And therefore progress

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
depended on learning how to reject

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
the authority of learned men,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
priests, traditions and rulers.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Which is why the Scientific Revolution

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
had to have a wider context.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
The Enlightenment, a revolution in how

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
people sought knowledge,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
trying not to rely on authority.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
"Take no one's word for it."

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
But that can't be what made the difference.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Authorities had been rejected before, many times.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
And that rarely, if ever,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
caused anything like the Scientific Revolution.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
At the time, what they thought

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
distinguished science

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
was a radical idea about things unseen,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
known as empiricism.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
All knowledge derives from the senses.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Well, we've seen that that can't be true.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
It did help by promoting

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
observation and experiment.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
But, from the outset, it was obvious

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
that there was something horribly wrong with it.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Knowledge comes from the senses.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
In what language? Certainly not the language of mathematics,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
in which, Galileo rightly said,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
the book of nature is written.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Look at the world. You don't see equations

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
carved on to the mountainsides.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
If you did, it would be because people

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
had carved them.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
By the way, why don't we do that?

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
What's wrong with us?

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000
(Laughter)

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Empiricism is inadequate

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
because, well,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
scientific theories explain the seen in terms of the unseen.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
And the unseen, you have to admit,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
doesn't come to us through the senses.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
We don't see those nuclear reactions in stars.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
We don't see the origin of species.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
We don't see the curvature of space-time,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
and other universes.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
But we know about those things.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
How?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Well, the classic empiricist answer is induction.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
The unseen resembles the seen.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
But it doesn't.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
You know what the clinching evidence was

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
that space-time is curved?

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
It was a photograph, not of space-time,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
but of an eclipse, with a dot there rather than there.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And the evidence for evolution?

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Some rocks and some finches.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
And parallel universes? Again: dots there,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
rather than there, on a screen.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
What we see, in all these cases,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
bears no resemblance to the reality

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
that we conclude is responsible --

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
only a long chain of theoretical reasoning

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
and interpretation connects them.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
"Ah!" say creationists.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
"So you admit it's all interpretation.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
No one has ever seen evolution.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
We see rocks.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
You have your interpretation. We have ours.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Yours comes from guesswork,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
ours from the Bible."

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:31.000
But what creationist and empiricists both ignore

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
is that, in that sense,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
no one has ever seen a bible either,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
that the eye only detects light, which we don't perceive.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Brains only detect nerve impulses.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
And they don't perceive even those as what they really are,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
namely electrical crackles.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
So we perceive nothing as what it really is.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Our connection to reality

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
is never just perception.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
It's always, as Karl Popper put it,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
theory-laden.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Scientific knowledge isn't derived from anything.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
It's like all knowledge. It's conjectural, guesswork,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
tested by observation,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
not derived from it.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
So, were testable conjectures

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
the great innovation that opened the intellectual prison gates?

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
No. Contrary to what's usually said,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
testability is common,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
in myths and all sorts of other irrational modes of thinking.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Any crank claiming the sun will go out next Tuesday

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
has got a testable prediction.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Consider the ancient Greek myth

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
explaining seasons.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Hades, God of the Underworld,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
kidnaps Persephone, the Goddess of Spring,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
and negotiates a forced marriage contract,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
requiring her to return regularly, and lets her go.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
And each year,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
she is magically compelled to return.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
And her mother, Demeter,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Goddess of the Earth,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
is sad, and makes it cold and barren.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
That myth is testable.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
If winter is caused by Demeter's sadness,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
then it must happen everywhere on Earth simultaneously.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
So if the ancient Greeks had only known that Australia

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
is at its warmest when Demeter is at her saddest,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
they'd have known that their theory is false.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
So what was wrong with that myth,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
and with all pre-scientific thinking,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
and what, then, made that momentous difference?

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
I think there is one thing you have to care about.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
And that implies

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
testability, the scientific method,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
the Enlightenment, and everything.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
And here is the crucial thing.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
There is such a thing as a defect in a story.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000
I don't just mean a logical defect. I mean a bad explanation.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
What does that mean? Well, explanation

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
is an assertion about what's there, unseen,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
that accounts for what's seen.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Because the explanatory role

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
of Persephone's marriage contract

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
could be played equally well

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
by infinitely many other

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
ad hoc entities.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Why a marriage contract and not any other reason

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
for regular annual action?

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Here is one. Persephone wasn't released.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
She escaped, and returns every spring

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
to take revenge on Hades,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
with her Spring powers.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
She cools his domain with Spring air,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
venting heat up to the surface, creating summer.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
That accounts for the same phenomena as the original myth.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
It's equally testable.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Yet what it asserts about reality

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
is, in many ways, the opposite.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
And that is possible because

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
the details of the original myth

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
are unrelated to seasons,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
except via the myth itself.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
This easy variability

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
is the sign of a bad explanation,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
because, without a functional reason to prefer

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000
one of countless variants,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
advocating one of them, in preference to the others,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
is irrational.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
So, for the essence of what

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
makes the difference to enable progress,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
seek good explanations,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
the ones that can't be easily varied,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
while still explaining the phenomena.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Now, our current explanation of seasons

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
is that the Earth's axis is tilted like that,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
so each hemisphere tilts toward the sun for half the year,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
and away for the other half.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Better put that up.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000
(Laughter)

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
That's a good explanation: hard to vary,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
because every detail plays a functional role.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
For instance, we know, independently of seasons,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
that surfaces tilted away

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
from radiant heat are heated less,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
and that a spinning sphere, in space,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
points in a constant direction.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
And the tilt also explains

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
the sun's angle of elevation at different times of year,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
and predicts that the seasons

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
will be out of phase in the two hemispheres.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
If they'd been observed in phase,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
the theory would have been refuted.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000
But now, the fact that it's also a good explanation,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
hard to vary, makes the crucial difference.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
If the ancient Greeks had found out

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
about seasons in Australia,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
they could have easily varied their myth

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
to predict that.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
For instance, when Demeter is upset,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
she banishes heat from her vicinity,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
into the other hemisphere, where it makes summer.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
So, being proved wrong by observation,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
and changing their theory accordingly,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
still wouldn't have got the ancient Greeks

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
one jot closer to understanding seasons,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
because their explanation was bad: easy to vary.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
And it's only when an explanation is good

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
that it even matters whether it's testable.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
If the axis-tilt theory had been refuted,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
its defenders would have had nowhere to go.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
No easily implemented change

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
could make that tilt

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000
cause the same seasons in both hemispheres.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
The search for hard-to-vary explanations

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
is the origin of all progress.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
It's the basic regulating principle

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
of the Enlightenment.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
So, in science, two false approaches blight progress.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
One is well known: untestable theories.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
But the more important one is explanationless theories.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Whenever you're told that some existing statistical trend will continue,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
but you aren't given a hard-to-vary account

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
of what causes that trend,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
you're being told a wizard did it.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
When you are told that carrots have human rights

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
because they share half our genes --

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.000
but not how gene percentages confer rights -- wizard.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
When someone announces that the nature-nurture debate

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
has been settled because there is evidence

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
that a given percentage of our

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
political opinions are genetically inherited,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
but they don't explain how genes cause opinions,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
they've settled nothing. They are saying that our

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
opinions are caused by wizards,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
and presumably so are their own.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
That the truth consists of

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
hard to vary assertions about reality

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
is the most important fact

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
about the physical world.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
It's a fact that is, itself, unseen,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
yet impossible to vary. Thank you.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
(Applause)
