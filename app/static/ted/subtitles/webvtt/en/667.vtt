00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
All buildings today have something in common.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
They're made using Victorian technologies.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This involves blueprints,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
industrial manufacturing

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and construction using teams of workers.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
All of this effort results in an inert object.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And that means that there is a one-way transfer of energy

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
from our environment into our homes and cities.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This is not sustainable.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I believe that the only way that it is possible for us

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
to construct genuinely sustainable homes and cities

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
is by connecting them to nature,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
not insulating them from it.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Now, in order to do this, we need the right kind of language.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Living systems are in constant conversation

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
with the natural world,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
through sets of chemical reactions called metabolism.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And this is the conversion of one group of substances

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
into another, either through

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
the production or the absorption of energy.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And this is the way in which living materials

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
make the most of their local resources

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
in a sustainable way.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So, I'm interested in the use of

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
metabolic materials for the practice of architecture.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
But they don't exist. So I'm having to make them.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I'm working with architect Neil Spiller

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
at the Bartlett School of Architecture,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and we're collaborating with international scientists

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
in order to generate these new materials

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
from a bottom up approach.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
That means we're generating them from scratch.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
One of our collaborators is chemist Martin Hanczyc,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and he's really interested in the transition from

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
inert to living matter.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Now, that's exactly the kind of process that I'm interested in,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
when we're thinking about sustainable materials.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
So, Martin, he works with a system called the protocell.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Now all this is -- and it's magic --

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
is a little fatty bag. And it's got a chemical battery in it.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And it has no DNA.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
This little bag is able to conduct itself

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
in a way that can only be described as living.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
It is able to move around its environment.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
It can follow chemical gradients.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
It can undergo complex reactions,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
some of which are happily architectural.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
So here we are. These are protocells,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
patterning their environment.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
We don't know how they do that yet.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Here, this is a protocell, and it's vigorously shedding this skin.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Now, this looks like a chemical kind of birth.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
This is a violent process.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Here, we've got a protocell to extract carbon dioxide

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
out of the atmosphere

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
and turn it into carbonate.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And that's the shell around that globular fat.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
They are quite brittle. So you've only got a part of one there.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
So what we're trying to do is, we're trying to push these technologies

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
towards creating bottom-up construction approaches

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
for architecture,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
which contrast the current, Victorian, top-down methods

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
which impose structure upon matter.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
That can't be energetically sensible.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
So, bottom-up materials

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
actually exist today.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
They've been in use, in architecture, since ancient times.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
If you walk around the city of Oxford, where we are today,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
and have a look at the brickwork,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
which I've enjoyed doing in the last couple of days,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
you'll actually see that a lot of it is made of limestone.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And if you look even closer,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
you'll see, in that limestone, there are little shells

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and little skeletons that are piled upon each other.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And then they are fossilized over millions of years.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Now a block of limestone, in itself,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
isn't particularly that interesting.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
It looks beautiful.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
But imagine what the properties of this limestone block might be

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
if the surfaces were actually

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
in conversation with the atmosphere.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Maybe they could extract carbon dioxide.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Would it give this block of limestone new properties?

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Well, most likely it would. It might be able to grow.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
It might be able to self-repair, and even respond

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
to dramatic changes

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
in the immediate environment.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
So, architects are never happy

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
with just one block of an interesting material.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
They think big. Okay?

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
So when we think about scaling up metabolic materials,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
we can start thinking about ecological interventions

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
like repair of atolls,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
or reclamation of parts of a city

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
that are damaged by water.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
So, one of these examples

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
would of course be the historic city of Venice.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Now, Venice, as you know, has a tempestuous relationship with the sea,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
and is built upon wooden piles.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
So we've devised a way by which it may be possible

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
for the protocell technology that we're working with

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
to sustainably reclaim Venice.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
And architect Christian Kerrigan

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
has come up with a series of designs that show us

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
how it may be possible to actually grow a limestone reef

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
underneath the city.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
So, here is the technology we have today.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
This is our protocell technology,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
effectively making a shell, like its limestone forefathers,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
and depositing it in a very complex environment,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
against natural materials.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
We're looking at crystal lattices to see the bonding process in this.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Now, this is the very interesting part.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
We don't just want limestone dumped everywhere in all the pretty canals.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
What we need it to do is to be

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
creatively crafted around the wooden piles.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
So, you can see from these diagrams that the protocell is actually

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
moving away from the light,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
toward the dark foundations.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
We've observed this in the laboratory.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
The protocells can actually move away from the light.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
They can actually also move towards the light. You have to just choose your species.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
So that these don't just exist as one entity,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
we kind of chemically engineer them.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
And so here the protocells are depositing their limestone

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
very specifically, around the foundations of Venice,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
effectively petrifying it.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Now, this isn't going to happen tomorrow. It's going to take a while.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
It's going to take years of tuning and monitoring this technology

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
in order for us to become ready

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
to test it out in a case-by-case basis

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
on the most damaged and stressed buildings within the city of Venice.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
But gradually, as the buildings are repaired,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
we will see the accretion of a limestone reef beneath the city.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
An accretion itself is a huge sink of carbon dioxide.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Also it will attract the local marine ecology,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
who will find their own ecological niches within this architecture.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
So, this is really interesting. Now we have an architecture

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
that connects a city to the natural world

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
in a very direct and immediate way.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
But perhaps the most exciting thing about it

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
is that the driver of this technology is available everywhere.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
This is terrestrial chemistry. We've all got it,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
which means that this technology is just as appropriate

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
for developing countries as it is

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
for First World countries.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
So, in summary, I'm generating metabolic materials

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
as a counterpoise to Victorian technologies,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and building architectures from a bottom-up approach.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Secondly, these metabolic materials

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
have some of the properties of living systems,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
which means they can perform in similar ways.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
They can expect to have a lot of forms and functions

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
within the practice of architecture.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
And finally, an observer in the future

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
marveling at a beautiful structure in the environment

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
may find it almost impossible to tell

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
whether this structure

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
has been created by a natural process

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
or an artificial one.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Thank you.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
(Applause)
