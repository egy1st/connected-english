00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm a writer and a journalist,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and I'm also an insanely curious person,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
so in 22 years as a journalist,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I've learned how to do a lot of new things.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And three years ago, one of the things I learned how to do

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
was to become invisible.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I became one of the working homeless.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I quit my job as a newspaper editor

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
after my father died in February of that same year,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and decided to travel.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
His death hit me pretty hard.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And there were a lot of things that I wanted to feel and deal with while I was doing that.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I've camped my whole life. And I decided

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
that living in a van for a year to do this

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
would be like one long camping trip.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So I packed my cat, my Rottweiler

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and my camping gear into a 1975 Chevy van,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and drove off into the sunset,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
having fully failed to realize three critical things.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
One: that society equates

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
living in a permanent structure, even a shack,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
with having value as a person.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Two: I failed to realize how quickly

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
the negative perceptions of other people

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
can impact our reality, if we let it.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Three: I failed to realize

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
that homelessness is an attitude,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
not a lifestyle.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
At first, living in the van was great.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I showered in campgrounds. I ate out regularly.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And I had time to relax and to grieve.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
But then the anger and the depression about my father's death set in.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
My freelance job ended. And I had to get a full-time job

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
to pay the bills.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
What had been a really mild spring

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
turned into a miserably hot summer.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And it became impossible to park anywhere --

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
(Laughs)

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
-- without being very obvious

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
that I had a cat and a dog with me, and it was really hot.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
The cat came and went through an open window in the van.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
The doggy went into doggy day care.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And I sweated.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Whenever I could, I used

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
employee showers in office buildings and truck stops.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Or I washed up in public rest rooms.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Nighttime temperatures in the van rarely dropped below 80 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
making it difficult or impossible to sleep.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Food rotted in the heat.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Ice in my ice chest melted within hours,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and it was pretty miserable.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I couldn't afford to find an apartment,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
or couldn't afford an apartment that would allow me

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
to have the Rottweiler and the cat.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And I refused to give them up,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
so I stayed in the van.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And when the heat made me too sick

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
to walk the 50 feet to the public restroom

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
outside my van at night,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
I used a bucket and a trash bag as a toilet.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
When winter weather set in, the temperatures dropped

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
below freezing. And they stayed there.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And I faced a whole new set of challenges.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
I parked a different place every night

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
so I would avoid being noticed and hassled by the police.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
I didn't always succeed.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.000
But I felt out of control of my life.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And I don't know when or how it happened,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
but the speed at which I went

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
from being a talented writer and journalist

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
to being a homeless woman, living in a van,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
took my breath away.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I hadn't changed. My I.Q. hadn't dropped.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
My talent, my integrity, my values,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
everything about me remained the same.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
But I had changed somehow.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
I spiraled deeper and deeper into a depression.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And eventually someone referred me to a homeless health clinic.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And I went. I hadn't bathed in three days.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
I was as smelly and as depressed as anyone in line.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
I just wasn't drunk or high.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
And when several of the homeless men realized that,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
including a former university professor,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
they said, "You aren't homeless. Why are you really here?"

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Other homeless people didn't see me as homeless,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
but I did.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Then the professor listened to my story and he said,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
"You have a job. You have hope.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
The real homeless don't have hope."

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
A reaction to the medication the clinic gave me for my depression

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
left me suicidal. And I remember thinking,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
"If I killed myself, no one would notice."

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
A friend told me, shortly after that,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
that she had heard that Tim Russert,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
a nationally renowned journalist,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
had been talking about me on national T.V.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
An essay I'd written about my father,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
the year before he died, was in Tim's new book.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And he was doing the talk show circuit. And he was talking about my writing.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And when I realized that Tim Russert, former moderator of "Meet the Press,"

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
was talking about my writing,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
while I was living in a van in a Wal-Mart parking lot,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
I started laughing.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
You should too.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000
(Laughter)

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
I started laughing

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
because it got to the point where,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
was I a writer, or was I a homeless woman?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
So I went in the bookstore. And I found Tim's book.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
And I stood there. And I reread my essay.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And I cried.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Because I was a writer.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
I was a writer.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Shortly after that I moved back to Tennessee.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
I alternated between living in a van and couch surfing with friends.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And I started writing again.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
By the summer of the following year I was a working journalist.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
I was winning awards. I was living in my own apartment.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
I was no longer homeless.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And I was no longer invisible.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Thousands of people work full and part-time jobs,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
and live in their cars.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
But society continues to stigmatize and criminalize

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
living in your vehicle or on the streets.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
So the homeless, the working homeless, primarily remain invisible.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
But if you ever meet one,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
engage them, encourage them, and offer them hope.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
The human spirit can overcome anything if it has hope.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
And I'm not here to be the poster girl for the homeless.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
I'm not here to encourage you to give money to the next panhandler you meet.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
But I am here to tell you that, based on my experience,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
people are not where they live,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
where they sleep,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
or what their life situation is at any given time.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Three years ago I was living in a van

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
in a Wal-Mart parking lot,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and today I'm speaking at TED.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Hope always, always finds a way. Thank you.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
(Applause)
