00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
On the 30th of May, 1832,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
a gunshot was heard

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
ringing out across the 13th arrondissement in Paris.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000
(Gunshot)

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
A peasant, who was walking to market that morning,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
ran towards where the gunshot had come from,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and found a young man writhing in agony on the floor,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
clearly shot by a dueling wound.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The young man's name was Evariste Galois.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
He was a well-known revolutionary in Paris at the time.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Galois was taken to the local hospital

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
where he died the next day in the arms of his brother.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And the last words he said to his brother were,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
"Don't cry for me, Alfred.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I need all the courage I can muster

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
to die at the age of 20."

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
It wasn't, in fact, revolutionary politics

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
for which Galois was famous.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
But a few years earlier, while still at school,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
he'd actually cracked one of the big mathematical

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
problems at the time.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And he wrote to the academicians in Paris,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
trying to explain his theory.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
But the academicians couldn't understand anything that he wrote.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
(Laughter)

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
This is how he wrote most of his mathematics.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So, the night before that duel, he realized

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
this possibly is his last chance

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
to try and explain his great breakthrough.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
So he stayed up the whole night, writing away,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
trying to explain his ideas.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And as the dawn came up and he went to meet his destiny,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
he left this pile of papers on the table for the next generation.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Maybe the fact that he stayed up all night doing mathematics

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
was the fact that he was such a bad shot that morning and got killed.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
But contained inside those documents

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
was a new language, a language to understand

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
one of the most fundamental concepts

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
of science -- namely symmetry.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Now, symmetry is almost nature's language.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
It helps us to understand so many

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
different bits of the scientific world.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
For example, molecular structure.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
What crystals are possible,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
we can understand through the mathematics of symmetry.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
In microbiology you really don't want to get a symmetrical object,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
because they are generally rather nasty.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
The swine flu virus, at the moment, is a symmetrical object.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And it uses the efficiency of symmetry

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
to be able to propagate itself so well.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
But on a larger scale of biology, actually symmetry is very important,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
because it actually communicates genetic information.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I've taken two pictures here and I've made them artificially symmetrical.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And if I ask you which of these you find more beautiful,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
you're probably drawn to the lower two.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Because it is hard to make symmetry.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And if you can make yourself symmetrical, you're sending out a sign

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
that you've got good genes, you've got a good upbringing

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
and therefore you'll make a good mate.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
So symmetry is a language which can help to communicate

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
genetic information.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Symmetry can also help us to explain

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
what's happening in the Large Hadron Collider in CERN.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Or what's not happening in the Large Hadron Collider in CERN.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
To be able to make predictions about the fundamental particles

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
we might see there,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
it seems that they are all facets of some strange symmetrical shape

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
in a higher dimensional space.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And I think Galileo summed up, very nicely,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
the power of mathematics

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
to understand the scientific world around us.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
He wrote, "The universe cannot be read

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
until we have learnt the language

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and become familiar with the characters in which it is written.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
It is written in mathematical language,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and the letters are triangles, circles and other geometric figures,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
without which means it is humanly impossible

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
to comprehend a single word."

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
But it's not just scientists who are interested in symmetry.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Artists too love to play around with symmetry.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
They also have a slightly more ambiguous relationship with it.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Here is Thomas Mann talking about symmetry in "The Magic Mountain."

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
He has a character describing the snowflake,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
and he says he "shuddered at its perfect precision,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
found it deathly, the very marrow of death."

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
But what artists like to do is to set up expectations

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
of symmetry and then break them.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And a beautiful example of this

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
I found, actually, when I visited a colleague of mine

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
in Japan, Professor Kurokawa.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And he took me up to the temples in Nikko.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And just after this photo was taken we walked up the stairs.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
And the gateway you see behind

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
has eight columns, with beautiful symmetrical designs on them.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Seven of them are exactly the same,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
and the eighth one is turned upside down.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And I said to Professor Kurokawa,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
"Wow, the architects must have really been kicking themselves

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
when they realized that they'd made a mistake and put this one upside down."

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And he said, "No, no, no. It was a very deliberate act."

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
And he referred me to this lovely quote from the Japanese

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
"Essays in Idleness" from the 14th century,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
in which the essayist wrote, "In everything,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
uniformity is undesirable.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Leaving something incomplete makes it interesting,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and gives one the feeling that there is room for growth."

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Even when building the Imperial Palace,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
they always leave one place unfinished.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
But if I had to choose one building in the world

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
to be cast out on a desert island, to live the rest of my life,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
being an addict of symmetry, I would probably choose the Alhambra in Granada.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
This is a palace celebrating symmetry.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Recently I took my family --

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
we do these rather kind of nerdy mathematical trips, which my family love.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
This is my son Tamer. You can see

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
he's really enjoying our mathematical trip to the Alhambra.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
But I wanted to try and enrich him.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
I think one of the problems about school mathematics

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
is it doesn't look at how mathematics is embedded

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
in the world we live in.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
So, I wanted to open his eyes up to

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
how much symmetry is running through the Alhambra.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
You see it already. Immediately you go in,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
the reflective symmetry in the water.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
But it's on the walls where all the exciting things are happening.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
The Moorish artists were denied the possibility

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
to draw things with souls.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
So they explored a more geometric art.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
And so what is symmetry?

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
The Alhambra somehow asks all of these questions.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
What is symmetry? When [there] are two of these walls,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
do they have the same symmetries?

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Can we say whether they discovered

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
all of the symmetries in the Alhambra?

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
And it was Galois who produced a language

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
to be able to answer some of these questions.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
For Galois, symmetry -- unlike for Thomas Mann,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
which was something still and deathly --

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
for Galois, symmetry was all about motion.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
What can you do to a symmetrical object,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
move it in some way, so it looks the same

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
as before you moved it?

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
I like to describe it as the magic trick moves.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
What can you do to something? You close your eyes.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
I do something, put it back down again.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
It looks like it did before it started.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
So, for example, the walls in the Alhambra --

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
I can take all of these tiles, and fix them at the yellow place,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
rotate them by 90 degrees,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
put them all back down again and they fit perfectly down there.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
And if you open your eyes again, you wouldn't know that they'd moved.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
But it's the motion that really characterizes the symmetry

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
inside the Alhambra.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
But it's also about producing a language to describe this.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
And the power of mathematics is often

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
to change one thing into another, to change geometry into language.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
So I'm going to take you through, perhaps push you a little bit mathematically --

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
so brace yourselves --

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
push you a little bit to understand how this language works,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
which enables us to capture what is symmetry.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
So, let's take these two symmetrical objects here.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Let's take the twisted six-pointed starfish.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
What can I do to the starfish which makes it look the same?

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Well, there I rotated it by a sixth of a turn,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
and still it looks like it did before I started.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
I could rotate it by a third of a turn,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
or a half a turn,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
or put it back down on its image, or two thirds of a turn.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
And a fifth symmetry, I can rotate it by five sixths of a turn.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
And those are things that I can do to the symmetrical object

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
that make it look like it did before I started.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Now, for Galois, there was actually a sixth symmetry.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Can anybody think what else I could do to this

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
which would leave it like I did before I started?

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
I can't flip it because I've put a little twist on it, haven't I?

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
It's got no reflective symmetry.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
But what I could do is just leave it where it is,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
pick it up, and put it down again.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
And for Galois this was like the zeroth symmetry.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Actually, the invention of the number zero

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
was a very modern concept, seventh century A.D., by the Indians.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
It seems mad to talk about nothing.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
And this is the same idea. This is a symmetrical --

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
so everything has symmetry, where you just leave it where it is.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
So, this object has six symmetries.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
And what about the triangle?

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Well, I can rotate by a third of a turn clockwise

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
or a third of a turn anticlockwise.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
But now this has some reflectional symmetry.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
I can reflect it in the line through X,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
or the line through Y,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
or the line through Z.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Five symmetries and then of course the zeroth symmetry

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
where I just pick it up and leave it where it is.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
So both of these objects have six symmetries.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Now, I'm a great believer that mathematics is not a spectator sport,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
and you have to do some mathematics

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
in order to really understand it.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
So here is a little question for you.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And I'm going to give a prize at the end of my talk

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
for the person who gets closest to the answer.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
The Rubik's Cube.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
How many symmetries does a Rubik's Cube have?

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
How many things can I do to this object

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
and put it down so it still looks like a cube?

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Okay? So I want you to think about that problem as we go on,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
and count how many symmetries there are.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
And there will be a prize for the person who gets closest at the end.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
But let's go back down to symmetries that I got for these two objects.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
What Galois realized: it isn't just the individual symmetries,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
but how they interact with each other

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
which really characterizes the symmetry of an object.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
If I do one magic trick move followed by another,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
the combination is a third magic trick move.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
And here we see Galois starting to develop

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
a language to see the substance

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
of the things unseen, the sort of abstract idea

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
of the symmetry underlying this physical object.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
For example, what if I turn the starfish

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
by a sixth of a turn,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
and then a third of a turn?

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
So I've given names. The capital letters, A, B, C, D, E, F,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
are the names for the rotations.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
B, for example, rotates the little yellow dot

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
to the B on the starfish. And so on.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
So what if I do B, which is a sixth of a turn,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
followed by C, which is a third of a turn?

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Well let's do that. A sixth of a turn,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
followed by a third of a turn,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
the combined effect is as if I had just rotated it by half a turn in one go.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
So the little table here records

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
how the algebra of these symmetries work.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
I do one followed by another, the answer is

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
it's rotation D, half a turn.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
What I if I did it in the other order? Would it make any difference?

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Let's see. Let's do the third of the turn first, and then the sixth of a turn.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Of course, it doesn't make any difference.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
It still ends up at half a turn.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
And there is some symmetry here in the way the symmetries interact with each other.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
But this is completely different to the symmetries of the triangle.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Let's see what happens if we do two symmetries

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
with the triangle, one after the other.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Let's do a rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
and reflect in the line through X.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Well, the combined effect is as if I had just done the reflection in the line through Z

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
to start with.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Now, let's do it in a different order.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Let's do the reflection in X first,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
followed by the rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
The combined effect, the triangle ends up somewhere completely different.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
It's as if it was reflected in the line through Y.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Now it matters what order you do the operations in.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
And this enables us to distinguish

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
why the symmetries of these objects --

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
they both have six symmetries. So why shouldn't we say

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
they have the same symmetries?

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
But the way the symmetries interact

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
enable us -- we've now got a language

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
to distinguish why these symmetries are fundamentally different.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
And you can try this when you go down to the pub, later on.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Take a beer mat and rotate it by a quarter of a turn,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
then flip it. And then do it in the other order,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
and the picture will be facing in the opposite direction.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Now, Galois produced some laws for how these tables -- how symmetries interact.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
It's almost like little Sudoku tables.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
You don't see any symmetry twice

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
in any row or column.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
And, using those rules, he was able to say

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
that there are in fact only two objects

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
with six symmetries.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
And they'll be the same as the symmetries of the triangle,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
or the symmetries of the six-pointed starfish.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
I think this is an amazing development.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
It's almost like the concept of number being developed for symmetry.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
In the front here, I've got one, two, three people

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
sitting on one, two, three chairs.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
The people and the chairs are very different,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
but the number, the abstract idea of the number, is the same.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
And we can see this now: we go back to the walls in the Alhambra.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Here are two very different walls,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
very different geometric pictures.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
But, using the language of Galois,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
we can understand that the underlying abstract symmetries of these things

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
are actually the same.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
For example, let's take this beautiful wall

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
with the triangles with a little twist on them.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
You can rotate them by a sixth of a turn

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
if you ignore the colors. We're not matching up the colors.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
But the shapes match up if I rotate by a sixth of a turn

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
around the point where all the triangles meet.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
What about the center of a triangle? I can rotate

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
by a third of a turn around the center of the triangle,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
and everything matches up.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
And then there is an interesting place halfway along an edge,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
where I can rotate by 180 degrees.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
And all the tiles match up again.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
So rotate along halfway along the edge, and they all match up.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Now, let's move to the very different-looking wall in the Alhambra.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
And we find the same symmetries here, and the same interaction.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000
So, there was a sixth of a turn. A third of a turn where the Z pieces meet.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
And the half a turn is halfway between the six pointed stars.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
And although these walls look very different,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Galois has produced a language to say

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
that in fact the symmetries underlying these are exactly the same.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
And it's a symmetry we call 6-3-2.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Here is another example in the Alhambra.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
This is a wall, a ceiling, and a floor.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
They all look very different. But this language allows us to say

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
that they are representations of the same symmetrical abstract object,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
which we call 4-4-2. Nothing to do with football,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
but because of the fact that there are two places where you can rotate

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
by a quarter of a turn, and one by half a turn.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Now, this power of the language is even more,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
because Galois can say,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
"Did the Moorish artists discover all of the possible symmetries

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
on the walls in the Alhambra?"

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
And it turns out they almost did.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
You can prove, using Galois' language,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
there are actually only 17

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
different symmetries that you can do in the walls in the Alhambra.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
And they, if you try to produce a different wall with this 18th one,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
it will have to have the same symmetries as one of these 17.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
But these are things that we can see.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
And the power of Galois' mathematical language

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
is it also allows us to create

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
symmetrical objects in the unseen world,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
beyond the two-dimensional, three-dimensional,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
all the way through to the four- or five- or infinite-dimensional space.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
And that's where I work. I create

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
mathematical objects, symmetrical objects,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
using Galois' language,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
in very high dimensional spaces.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
So I think it's a great example of things unseen,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
which the power of mathematical language allows you to create.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
So, like Galois, I stayed up all last night

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
creating a new mathematical symmetrical object for you,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
and I've got a picture of it here.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Well, unfortunately it isn't really a picture. If I could have my board

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
at the side here, great, excellent.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Here we are. Unfortunately, I can't show you

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
a picture of this symmetrical object.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
But here is the language which describes

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
how the symmetries interact.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Now, this new symmetrical object

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
does not have a name yet.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Now, people like getting their names on things,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
on craters on the moon

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
or new species of animals.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
So I'm going to give you the chance to get your name on a new symmetrical object

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
which hasn't been named before.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
And this thing -- species die away,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
and moons kind of get hit by meteors and explode --

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
but this mathematical object will live forever.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
It will make you immortal.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
In order to win this symmetrical object,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
what you have to do is to answer the question I asked you at the beginning.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000
How many symmetries does a Rubik's Cube have?

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Okay, I'm going to sort you out.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Rather than you all shouting out, I want you to count how many digits there are

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
in that number. Okay?

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
If you've got it as a factorial, you've got to expand the factorials.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Okay, now if you want to play,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
I want you to stand up, okay?

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
If you think you've got an estimate for how many digits,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
right -- we've already got one competitor here.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
If you all stay down he wins it automatically.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Okay. Excellent. So we've got four here, five, six.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Great. Excellent. That should get us going. All right.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Anybody with five or less digits, you've got to sit down,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
because you've underestimated.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Five or less digits. So, if you're in the tens of thousands you've got to sit down.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
60 digits or more, you've got to sit down.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
You've overestimated.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000
20 digits or less, sit down.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000
How many digits are there in your number?

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Two? So you should have sat down earlier.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000
(Laughter)

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Let's have the other ones, who sat down during the 20, up again. Okay?

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
If I told you 20 or less, stand up.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Because this one. I think there were a few here.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
The people who just last sat down.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Okay, how many digits do you have in your number?

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
(Laughs)

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
21. Okay good. How many do you have in yours?

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
18. So it goes to this lady here.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
21 is the closest.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
It actually has -- the number of symmetries in the Rubik's cube

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
has 25 digits.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
So now I need to name this object.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
So, what is your name?

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
I need your surname. Symmetrical objects generally --

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
spell it for me.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:02.000
G-H-E-Z

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
No, SO2 has already been used, actually,

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
in the mathematical language. So you can't have that one.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
So Ghez, there we go. That's your new symmetrical object.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
You are now immortal.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:16.000
(Applause)

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
And if you'd like your own symmetrical object,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
I have a project raising money for a charity in Guatemala,

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
where I will stay up all night and devise an object for you,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
for a donation to this charity to help kids get into education in Guatemala.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
And I think what drives me, as a mathematician,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
are those things which are not seen, the things that we haven't discovered.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
It's all the unanswered questions which make mathematics a living subject.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
And I will always come back to this quote from the Japanese "Essays in Idleness":

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
"In everything, uniformity is undesirable.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Leaving something incomplete makes it interesting,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
and gives one the feeling that there is room for growth." Thank you.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:58.000
(Applause)
