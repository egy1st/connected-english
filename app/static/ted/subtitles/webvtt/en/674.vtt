00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:11.000
A human child is born,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and for quite a long time

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
is a consumer.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:33.000
It cannot be consciously a contributor.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
It is helpless.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
It doesn't know how to survive,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:53.000
even though it is endowed with an instinct to survive.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:09.000
It needs the help of mother, or a foster mother, to survive.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:22.000
It can't afford to doubt the person who tends the child.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
It has to totally surrender,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
as one surrenders to an anesthesiologist.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
It has to totally surrender.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:48.000
That implies a lot of trust.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.000
That implies the trusted person

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
won't violate the trust.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
As the child grows,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
it begins to discover

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
that the person trusted is violating the trust.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
It doesn't know even the word "violation."

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Therefore, it has to blame itself,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
a wordless blame,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:39.000
which is more difficult to really resolve --

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
the wordless self-blame.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
As the child grows to become an adult:

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
so far, it has been a consumer,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
but the growth of a human being

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:07.000
lies in his or her capacity to contribute,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
to be a contributor.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000
One cannot contribute unless one feels secure,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
one feels big,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000
one feels: I have enough.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
To be compassionate is not a joke.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
It's not that simple.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.000
One has to discover a certain bigness in oneself.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
That bigness should be centered on oneself,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
not in terms of money,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
not in terms of power you wield,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:58.000
not in terms of any status that you can command in the society,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
but it should be centered on oneself.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
The self: you are self-aware.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:14.000
On that self, it should be centered -- a bigness, a wholeness.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Otherwise, compassion is just a word and a dream.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
You can be compassionate occasionally,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
more moved by empathy

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.000
than by compassion.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Thank God we are empathetic.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
When somebody's in pain, we pick up the pain.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.000
In a Wimbledon final match,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
these two guys fight it out.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Each one has got two games.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
It can be anybody's game.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.000
What they have sweated so far has no meaning.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000
One person wins.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:30.000
The tennis etiquette is, both the players have to come to the net

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
and shake hands.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
The winner boxes the air

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
and kisses the ground,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
throws his shirt as though somebody is waiting for it.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
(Laughter)

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And this guy has to come to the net.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
When he comes to the net,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
you see, his whole face changes.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
It looks as though he's wishing that he didn't win.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Why? Empathy.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
That's human heart.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000
No human heart is denied of that empathy.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.000
No religion can demolish that by indoctrination.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.000
No culture, no nation and nationalism --

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
nothing can touch it

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
because it is empathy.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.000
And that capacity to empathize

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:52.000
is the window through which you reach out to people,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
you do something that makes a difference in somebody's life --

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
even words, even time.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Compassion is not defined in one form.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
There's no Indian compassion.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
There's no American compassion.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000
It transcends nation, the gender, the age.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Why? Because it is there in everybody.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:38.000
It's experienced by people occasionally.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Then this occasional compassion,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
we are not talking about --

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
it will never remain occasional.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
By mandate, you cannot make a person compassionate.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
You can't say, "Please love me."

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Love is something you discover.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000
It's not an action,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
but in the English language, it is also an action.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
I will come to it later.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:26.000
So one has got to discover a certain wholeness.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:33.000
I am going to cite the possibility of being whole,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:40.000
which is within our experience, everybody's experience.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:49.000
In spite of a very tragic life,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:59.000
one is happy in moments which are very few and far between.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
And the one who is happy,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:10.000
even for a slapstick joke,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:19.000
accepts himself and also the scheme of things in which one finds oneself.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
That means the whole universe,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
known things and unknown things.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000
All of them are totally accepted

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000
because you discover your wholeness in yourself.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
The subject -- "me" --

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
and the object -- the scheme of things --

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
fuse into oneness,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.000
an experience nobody can say, "I am denied of,"

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.000
an experience common to all and sundry.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:12.000
That experience confirms that, in spite of all your limitations --

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
all your wants, desires, unfulfilled, and the credit cards

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000
and layoffs

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
and, finally, baldness --

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
you can be happy.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
But the extension of the logic is

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:41.000
that you don't need to fulfill your desire to be happy.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:47.000
You are the very happiness, the wholeness that you want to be.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
There's no choice in this:

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.000
that only confirms the reality

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:02.000
that the wholeness cannot be different from you,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
cannot be minus you.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
It has got to be you.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
You cannot be a part of wholeness

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
and still be whole.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Your moment of happiness reveals that reality,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
that realization, that recognition:

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
"Maybe I am the whole.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Maybe the swami is right.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Maybe the swami is right." You start your new life.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Then everything becomes meaningful.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
I have no more reason to blame myself.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:57.000
If one has to blame oneself, one has a million reasons plus many.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:03.000
But if I say, in spite of my body being limited --

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:12.000
if it is black it is not white, if it is white it is not black:

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:18.000
body is limited any which way you look at it. Limited.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Your knowledge is limited, health is limited,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
and power is therefore limited,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
and the cheerfulness is going to be limited.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Compassion is going to be limited.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Everything is going to be limitless.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:44.000
You cannot command compassion

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
unless you become limitless, and nobody can become limitless,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000
either you are or you are not. Period.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:02.000
And there is no way of your being not limitless too.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Your own experience reveals, in spite of all limitations, you are the whole.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And the wholeness is the reality of you

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
when you relate to the world.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
It is love first.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
When you relate to the world,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
the dynamic manifestation of the wholeness

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
is, what we say, love.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
And itself becomes compassion

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:49.000
if the object that you relate to evokes that emotion.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Then that again transforms into giving, into sharing.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:05.000
You express yourself because you have compassion.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:11.000
To discover compassion, you need to be compassionate.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
To discover the capacity to give and share,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
you need to be giving and sharing.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000
There is no shortcut: it is like swimming by swimming.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
You learn swimming by swimming.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
You cannot learn swimming on a foam mattress and enter into water.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
(Laughter)

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
You learn swimming by swimming. You learn cycling by cycling.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
You learn cooking by cooking,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
having some sympathetic people around you

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
to eat what you cook.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
(Laughter)

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
And, therefore, what I say,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
you have to fake it and make it.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:05.000
(Laughter)

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
You need to.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:14.000
My predecessor meant that.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000
You have to act it out.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:26.000
You have to act compassionately.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
There is no verb for compassion,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
but you have an adverb for compassion.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
That's interesting to me.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:45.000
You act compassionately.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
But then, how to act compassionately if you don't have compassion?

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
That is where you fake.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000
You fake it and make it. This is the mantra of the United States of America.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000
(Laughter)

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
You fake it and make it.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
You act compassionately as though you have compassion:

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
grind your teeth,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
take all the support system.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000
If you know how to pray, pray.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Ask for compassion.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Let me act compassionately.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Do it.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
You'll discover compassion

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
and also slowly a relative compassion,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
and slowly, perhaps if you get the right teaching,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000
you'll discover compassion is a dynamic manifestation

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:47.000
of the reality of yourself, which is oneness, wholeness,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
and that's what you are.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
With these words, thank you very much.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
(Applause)
