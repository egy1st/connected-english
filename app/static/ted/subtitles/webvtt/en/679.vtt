00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm going to talk about compassion and the golden rule

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
from a secular perspective and even from a kind of scientific perspective.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I'm going to try to give you a little bit of a natural history

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
of compassion and the golden rule.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So, I'm going to be sometimes using kind of clinical language,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and so it's not going to sound as warm and fuzzy

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
as your average compassion talk.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I want to warn you about that.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So, I do want to say, at the outset, that I think compassion's great.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The golden rule is great. I'm a big supporter of both.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And I think it's great that

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
the leaders of the religions of the world

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
are affirming compassion and the golden rule as fundamental principles

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
that are integral to their faiths.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
At the same time, I think religions don't deserve all the credit.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I think nature gave them a helping hand here.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I'm going to argue tonight that compassion and the golden rule

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
are, in a certain sense, built into human nature.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
But I'm also going to argue

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
that once you understand the sense in which they are built into human nature,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
you realize that just affirming compassion,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and affirming the golden rule, is really not enough.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
There's a lot of work to be done after that.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
OK so, a quick natural history, first of compassion.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
In the beginning, there was compassion,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and I mean not just when human beings first showed up,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
but actually even before that.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I think it's probably the case that, in the human evolutionary lineage,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
even before there were homo sapiens,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
feelings like compassion and love and sympathy

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
had earned their way into the gene pool,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and biologists have a pretty clear idea of how this first happened.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
It happened through a principle known as kin selection.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And the basic idea of kin selection is that,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
if an animal feels compassion for a close relative,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and this compassion leads the animal to help the relative,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
then, in the end, the compassion actually winds up helping the genes

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
underlying the compassion itself.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
So, from a biologist's point of view, compassion is actually

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
a gene's way of helping itself. OK.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I warned you this was not going to be very warm and fuzzy.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I'll get there -- I hope to get a little fuzzier.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
This doesn't bother me so much,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
that the underlying Darwinian rationale of compassion

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
is kind of self-serving at the genetic level.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Actually, I think the bad news about kin selection

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
is just that it means that this kind of compassion

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
is naturally deployed only within the family.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
That's the bad news. The good news is compassion is natural.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
The bad news is that this kin selected compassion

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
is naturally confined to the family.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Now, there's more good news that came along later in evolution,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
a second kind of evolutionary logic.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Biologists call that "reciprocal altruism." OK.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
And there, the basic idea is that

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:15.000
compassion leads you to do good things for people who then will return the favor.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Again, I know this is not as inspiring a notion of compassion

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
as you may have heard in the past,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
but from a biologist's point of view, this reciprocal altruism kind of compassion

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
is ultimately self-serving too.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
It's not that people think that, when they feel the compassion.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
It's not consciously self-serving, but to a biologist, that's the logic.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000
And so, you wind up most easily extending compassion to friends and allies.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000
I'm sure a lot of you, if a close friend has something really terrible happen to them,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
you feel really bad.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
But if you read in the newspaper

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
that something really horrible happened to somebody you've never heard of,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
you can probably live with that.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
That's just human nature.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
So, it's another good news/bad news story.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
It's good that compassion was extended beyond the family

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
by this kind of evolutionary logic.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000
The bad news is this doesn't bring us universal compassion by itself.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
So, there's still work to be done.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Now, there's one other result of this dynamic called reciprocal altruism,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
which I think is kind of good news,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
which is that the way that this is played out in the human species,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
it has given people an intuitive appreciation of the golden rule.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
I don't quite mean that the golden rule itself is written in our genes,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
but you can go to a hunter gatherer society

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
that has had no exposure to any of the great religious traditions,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
no exposure to ethical philosophy,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
and you'll find, if you spend time with these people,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
that, basically, they believe that one good turn deserves another,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
and that bad deeds should be punished.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000
And evolutionary psychologists think that these intuitions have a basis in the genes.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
So, they do understand that if you want to be treated well,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
you treat other people well.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And it's good to treat other people well.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
That's close to being a kind of built-in intuition.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
So, that's good news. Now, if you've been paying attention,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
you're probably anticipating that there's bad news here;

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
we still aren't to universal love,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
and it's true because, although an appreciation of the golden rule is natural,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
it's also natural to carve out exceptions to the golden rule.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
I mean, for example, none of us, probably, want to go to prison,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
but we all think that there are some people who should go to prison. Right?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
So, we think we should treat them differently than we would want to be treated.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Now, we have a rationale for that.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
We say they did these bad things that make it just that they should go to prison.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
None of us really extends the golden rule in truly diffuse and universal fashion.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
We have the capacity to carve out exceptions,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
put people in a special category.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And the problem is that -- although in the case of sending people to prison,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
you have this impartial judiciary

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
determining who gets excluded from the golden rule --

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
that in everyday life, the way we all make these decisions

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
about who we're not going to extend the golden rule to,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
is we use a much rougher and readier formula.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Basically it's just like, if you're my enemy, if you're my rival --

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
if you're not my friend, if you're not in my family --

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
I'm much less inclined to apply the golden rule to you.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
We all do that,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
and you see it all over the world.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
You see it in the Middle East:

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
people who, from Gaza, are firing missiles at Israel.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
They wouldn't want to have missiles fired at them, but they say,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
"Well, but the Israelis, or some of them have done things

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
that put them in a special category."

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
The Israelis would not want to have an economic blockade imposed on them,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
but they impose one on Gaza, and they say,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
"Well, the Palestinians, or some of them, have brought this on themselves."

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:55.000
So, it's these exclusions to the golden rule that amount to a lot of the world's trouble.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
And it's natural to do that.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
So, the fact that the golden rule is in some sense built in to us

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.000
is not, by itself, going to bring us universal love.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
It's not going to save the world.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Now, there's one piece of good news I have that may save the world. Okay.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Are you on the edges of your seats here?

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Good, because before I tell you about that good news,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
I'm going to have to take a little excursion through some academic terrain.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
So, I hope I've got your attention with this promise of good news

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
that may save the world.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
It's this non-zero-sumness stuff you just heard a little bit about.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
It's just a quick introduction to game theory.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
This won't hurt. Okay.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
It's about zero-sum and non-zero-sum games.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
If you ask what kind of a situation

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
is conducive to people becoming friends and allies,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
the technical answer is a non-zero-sum situation.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
And if you ask what kind of situation

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
is conducive to people defining people as enemies,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
it's a zero-sum situation.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
So, what do those terms mean?

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Basically, a zero-sum game is the kind you're used to in sports,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
where there's a winner and a loser.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
So, their fortunes add up to zero.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
So, in tennis, every point is either good for you and bad for the other person,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
or good for them, bad for you.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Either way, your fortunes add up to zero. That's a zero-sum game.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Now, if you're playing doubles,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
then the person on your side of the net

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
is in a non-zero-sum relationship with you,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
because every point is either good for both of you -- positive, win-win --

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
or bad for both of you, it's lose-lose.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
That's a non-zero-sum game.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
And in real life, there are lots of non-zero-sum games.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
In the realm of economics, say, if you buy something:

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
that means you'd rather have the merchandise than the money,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
but the merchant would rather have the money than the merchandise.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
You both feel you've won.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
In a war, two allies are playing a non-zero-sum game.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
It's going to either be win-win or lose-lose for them.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:57.000
So, there are lots of non-zero-sum games in real life.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
And you could basically reformulate what I said earlier,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
about how compassion is deployed and the golden rule is deployed,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.000
by just saying, well, compassion most naturally flows along non-zero-sum channels

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
where people perceive themselves as being in a potentially win-win situation

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
with some of their friends or allies.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
The deployment of the golden rule

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
most naturally happens along these non-zero-sum channels.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
So, kind of webs of non-zero-sumness

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
are where you would expect compassion and the golden rule

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
to kind of work their magic.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
With zero-sum channels you would expect something else.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Okay. So, now you're ready for the good news that I said might save the world.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And now I can admit that it might not too,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.000
now that I've held your attention for three minutes of technical stuff.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.000
But it may. And the good news is that history

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000
has naturally expanded these webs of non-zero-sumness,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
these webs that can be these channels for compassion.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
You can go back all the way to the stone age:

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:08.000
technological evolution -- roads, the wheel, writing,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
a lot of transportation and communication technologies --

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
has just inexorably made it so that more people

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
can be in more non-zero-sum relationships

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
with more and more people at greater and greater distances.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
That's the story of civilization.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000
It's why social organization has grown from the hunter-gatherer village

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
to the ancient state, the empire, and now here we are in a globalized world.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
And the story of globalization is largely a story of non-zero-sumness.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
You've probably heard the term "interdependence"

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
applied to the modern world. Well, that's just another term for non-zero-sum.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
If your fortunes are interdependent with somebody,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
then you live in a non-zero-sum relationship with them.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
And you see this all the time in the modern world.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
You saw it with the recent economic crash,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
where bad things happen in the economy --

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
bad for everybody, for much of the world.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Good things happen, and it's good for much of the world.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
And, you know, I'm happy to say, I think there's really evidence

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
that this non-zero-sum kind of connection

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
can expand the moral compass.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
I mean, if you look at the American attitudes

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000
toward Japanese during World War II --

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
look at the depictions of Japanese

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
in the American media as just about subhuman,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
and look at the fact that we dropped atomic bombs,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
really without giving it much of a thought --

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
and you compare that to the attitude now,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
I think part of that is due to a kind of economic interdependence.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Any form of interdependence, or non-zero-sum relationship

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
forces you to acknowledge the humanity of people.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
So, I think that's good.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
And the world is full of non-zero-sum dynamics.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Environmental problems, in many ways, put us all in the same boat.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
And there are non-zero-sum relationships that maybe people aren't aware of.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
For example, probably a lot of American Christians

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
don't think of themselves as being in a non-zero-sum relationship

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
with Muslims halfway around the world,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000
but they really are, because if these Muslims become happier and happier

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
with their place in the world and feel that they have a place in it,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
that's good for Americans, because there will be fewer terrorists

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
to threaten American security.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
If they get less and less happy, that will be bad for Americans.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
So, there's plenty of non-zero-sumness.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
And so, the question is: If there's so much non-zero-sumness,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
why has the world not yet been suffused in love, peace, and understanding?

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
The answer's complicated. It's the occasion for a whole other talk.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Certainly, a couple of things are that,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
first of all, there are a lot of zero-sum situations in the world.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
And also, sometimes people don't recognize

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
the non-zero-sum dynamics in the world.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
In both of these areas,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
I think politicians can play a role.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
This isn't only about religion.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
I think politicians can help foster non-zero-sum relationships,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Economic engagement is generally better than blockades and so on,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
in this regard.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
And politicians can be aware, and should be aware that,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
when people around the world are looking at them,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
are looking at their nation

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
and picking up their cues

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
for whether they are in a zero-sum or a non-zero-sum relationship with a nation --

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
like, say, America, or any other nation --

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
human psychology is such that they use cues like:

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Do we feel we're being respected?

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Because, you know, historically, if you're not being respected,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
you're probably not going to wind up in a non-zero-sum,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
mutually profitable relationship with people.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
So, we need to be aware of what kind of signals we're sending out.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000
And some of this, again, is in the realm of political work.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
If there's one thing I can encourage everyone to do,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
politicians, religious leaders, and us,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
it would be what I call "expanding the moral imagination" --

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
that is to say, your ability to put yourself in the shoes

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
of people in very different circumstances.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
This is not the same as compassion,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:10.000
but it's conducive to compassion. It opens the channels for compassion.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
And I'm afraid we have another good news/bad news story,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
which is that the moral imagination is part of human nature.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000
That's good, but again we tend to deploy it selectively.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Once we define somebody as an enemy,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000
we have trouble putting ourselves in their shoes, just naturally.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000
So, if you want to take a particularly hard case for an American:

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
somebody in Iran who is burning an American flag, and you see them on TV.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Well, the average American is going to resist

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000
the moral exercise of putting themselves in that person's head

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
and is going to resist the idea that they have much in common with that person.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
And if you tell them, "Well, they think America disrespects them

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
and even wants to dominate them, and they hate America.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Has there ever been somebody who disrespected you so much

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
that you kind of hated them briefly"?

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
You know, they'll resist that comparison and that's natural, that's human.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
And, similarly, the person in Iran:

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
when you try to humanize somebody in America who said that Islam is evil,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
they'll have trouble with that.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.000
So, it's a very difficult thing to get people to expand the moral imagination

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
to a place it doesn't naturally go.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
I think it's worth the trouble because,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
again, it just helps us to understand.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
If you want to reduce the number of people who are burning flags,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
it helps to understand what makes them do it.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
And I think it's good moral exercise.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
I would say here is where religious leaders come in,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:38.000
because religious leaders are good at reframing issues for people,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
at harnessing the emotional centers of the brain

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000
to get people to alter their awareness and reframe the way they think.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
I mean, religious leaders are kind of in the inspiration business.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
It's their great calling right now,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
to get people all around the world better at expanding their moral imaginations,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
appreciating that in so many ways they're in the same boat.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:05.000
I would just sum up the way things look, at least from this secular perspective,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
as far as compassion and the golden rule go,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:15.000
by saying that it's good news that compassion and the golden rule

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000
are in some sense built into human nature.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
It's unfortunate that they tend to be selectively deployed.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
And it's going to take real work to change that.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000
But, nobody ever said that doing God's work was going to be easy. Thanks.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
(Applause)
