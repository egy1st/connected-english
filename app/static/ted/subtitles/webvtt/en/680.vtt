00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I believe that there are new, hidden tensions

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
that are actually happening between people and institutions --

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
institutions that are the institutions that people

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
inhabit in their daily life:

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
schools, hospitals, workplaces,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
factories, offices, etc.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And something that I see happening

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
is something that I would like to call

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
a sort of "democratization of intimacy."

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And what do I mean by that?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I mean that what people are doing

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
is, in fact, they are sort of, with their communication channels,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
they are breaking an imposed isolation

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
that these institutions are imposing on them.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
How are they doing this? They're doing it

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
in a very simple way, by calling their mom from work,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
by IMing from their office to their friends,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
by texting under the desk.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The pictures that you're seeing behind me

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
are people that I visited in the last few months.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And I asked them to come along with the person they communicate with most.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And somebody brought a boyfriend, somebody a father.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
One young woman brought her grandfather.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
For 20 years, I've been looking at how people use

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
channels such as email, the mobile phone, texting, etc.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
What we're actually going to see is that, fundamentally,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
people are communicating on a regular basis

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
with five, six, seven of their most intimate sphere.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Now, lets take some data. Facebook.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Recently some sociologists from Facebook --

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Facebook is the channel that you would expect

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
is the most enlargening of all channels.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And an average user,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
said Cameron Marlow,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
from Facebook, has about 120 friends.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
But he actually talks to,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
has two-way exchanges with, about four to six people

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
on a regular base, depending on his gender.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Academic research on instant messaging

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
also shows 100 people on buddy lists,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
but fundamentally people chat with two, three, four --

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
anyway, less than five.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
My own research on cellphones and voice calls

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
shows that 80 percent of the calls

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
are actually made to four people. 80 percent.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And when you go to Skype, it's down to two people.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
A lot of sociologists actually are quite disappointed.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I mean, I've been a bit disappointed sometimes

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
when I saw this data and all this deployment, just for five people.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And some sociologists actually feel that

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
it's a closure, it's a cocooning,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
that we're disengaging from the public.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
And I would actually, I would like to show you that

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
if we actually look at who is doing it,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and from where they're doing it,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
actually there is an incredible social transformation.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
There are three stories that I think are quite good examples.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
The first gentleman, he's a baker.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And so he starts working every morning at four o'clock in the morning.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And around eight o'clock he sort of sneaks away from his oven,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
cleans his hands from the flour

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
and calls his wife.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
He just wants to wish her a good day, because that's the start of her day.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And I've heard this story a number of times.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
A young factory worker who works night shifts,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
who manages to sneak away from the factory floor,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
where there is CCTV by the way,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and find a corner, where at 11 o'clock at night

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
he can call his girlfriend and just say goodnight.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Or a mother who, at four o'clock,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
suddenly manages to find a corner in the toilet

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
to check that her children are safely home.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Then there is another couple, there is a Brazilian couple.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
They've lived in Italy for a number of years.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
They Skype with their families a few times a week.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
But once a fortnight, they actually put the computer on their dining table,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
pull out the webcam and actually have dinner

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
with their family in Sao Paulo. And they have a big event of it.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And I heard this story the first time a couple of years ago

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
from a very modest family

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
of immigrants from Kosovo in Switzerland.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
They had set up a big screen in their living room,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and every morning they had breakfast with their grandmother.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
But Danny Miller, who is a very good anthropologist

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
who is working on Filipina migrant women

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
who leave their children back in the Philippines,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
was telling me about how much parenting is going on

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
through Skype,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
and how much these mothers are engaged with their children through Skype.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
And then there is the third couple. They are two friends.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
They chat to each other every day, a few times a day actually.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
And finally, finally, they've managed to put

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
instant messaging on their computers at work.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And now, obviously, they have it open.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Whenever they have a moment they chat to each other.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And this is exactly what we've been seeing

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
with teenagers and kids doing it in school, under the table,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
and texting under the table to their friends.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
So, none of these cases are unique.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
I mean, I could tell you hundreds of them.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
But what is really exceptional is the setting.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
So, think of the three settings I've talked to you about:

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
factory, migration, office.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
But it could be in a school, it could be an administration,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
it could be a hospital.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Three settings that, if we just step back 15 years,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
if you just think back 15 years,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
when you clocked in,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
when you clocked in to an office,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
when you clocked in to a factory,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
there was no contact for the whole duration of the time,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
there was no contact with your private sphere.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
If you were lucky there was a public phone hanging in the corridor or somewhere.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
If you were in management, oh, that was a different story.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Maybe you had a direct line.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
If you were not, you maybe had to go through an operator.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
But basically, when you walked into those buildings,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
the private sphere was left behind you.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And this has become such a norm of our professional lives,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
such a norm and such an expectation.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
And it had nothing to do with technical capability.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
The phones were there. But the expectation was once you moved in there

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
your commitment was fully to the task at hand,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
fully to the people around you.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
That was where the focus had to be.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And this has become such a cultural norm

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
that we actually school our children for them to be capable to do this cleavage.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
If you think nursery, kindergarten, first years of school

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
are just dedicated to take away the children,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
to make them used to staying long hours away from their family.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And then the school enacts perfectly well.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
It mimics perfectly all the rituals that we will find in offices:

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
rituals of entry, rituals of exit,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
the schedules, the uniforms in this country,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
things that identify you, team-building activities,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
team building that will allow you to basically

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
be with a random group of kids, or a random group of people

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
that you will have to be with for a number of time.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
And of course, the major thing:

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
learn to pay attention,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
to concentrate and focus your attention.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
This only started about 150 years ago.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
It only started with the birth of modern bureaucracy,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
and of industrial revolution.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
When people basically had to go somewhere else to work

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and carry out the work.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
And when with modern bureaucracy there was a very rational approach,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
where there was a clear distinction between the private sphere

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
and the public sphere.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
So, until then, basically people were living on top of their trades.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
They were living on top of the land they were laboring.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
They were living on top of the workshops where they were working.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
And if you think, it's permeated our whole culture,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
even our cities.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
If you think of medieval cities, medieval cities the boroughs

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
all have the names of the guilds and professions that lived there.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Now we have sprawling residential suburbias

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
that are well distinct from production areas

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
and commercial areas.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
And actually, over these 150 years,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
there has been a very clear class system that also has emerged.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
So the lower the status of the job

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
and of the person carrying out, the more removed

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
he would be from his personal sphere.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
People have taken this amazing possibility

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
of actually being in contact all through the day

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
or in all types of situations.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
And they are doing it massively.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
The Pew Institute, which produces good data

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
on a regular basis on, for instance, in the States,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
says that -- and I think that this number is conservative --

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
50 percent of anybody with email access at work

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
is actually doing private email from his office.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
I really think that the number is conservative.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
In my own research, we saw that the peak for private email

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
is actually 11 o'clock in the morning, whatever the country.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
75 percent of people admit doing private

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
conversations from work on their mobile phones.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
100 percent are using text.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
The point is that this re-appropriation of the personal sphere

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
is not terribly successful with all institutions.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
I'm always surprised the U.S. Army

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
sociologists are discussing of the impact

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
for instance, of soldiers in Iraq

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
having daily contact with their families.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.000
But there are many institutions that are actually blocking this access.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
And every day, every single day,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
I read news that makes me cringe,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
like a $15 fine

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
to kids in Texas,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
for using, every time they take out their mobile phone in school.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Immediate dismissal to bus drivers in New York,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
if seen with a mobile phone in a hand.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Companies blocking access to IM or to Facebook.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Behind issues of security and safety,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
which have always been the arguments for social control,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
in fact what is going on is that

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
these institutions are trying to decide

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
who, in fact, has a right to self determine their attention,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
to decide, whether they should, or not, be isolated.
