00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
A few years ago, my eyes were opened

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
to the dark side of the construction industry.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
In 2006, young Qatari students

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
took me to go and see the migrant worker camps.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And since then I've followed the unfolding issue of worker rights.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
In the last six months, more than 300 skyscrapers

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
in the UAE have been put on hold or canceled.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Behind the headlines that lay behind these buildings

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
is the fate of the often-indentured construction worker.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
1.1 million of them.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Mainly Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and Nepalese, these laborers risk everything

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
to make money for their families back home.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
They pay a middle-man thousands of dollars to be there.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And when they arrive, they find themselves in labor camps with no water,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
no air conditioning, and their passports taken away.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
While it's easy to point the finger at local officials and higher authorities,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
99 percent of these people are hired by the private sector,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and so therefore we're equally, if not more, accountable.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Groups like Buildsafe UAE have emerged,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
but the numbers are simply overwhelming.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
In August 2008,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
UAE public officials noted

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
that 40 percent of the country's 1,098 labor camps

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
had violated minimum health and fire safety regulations.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And last summer, more than 10,000 workers

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
protested for the non-payment of wages,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
for the poor quality of food, and inadequate housing.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And then the financial collapse happened.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
When the contractors have gone bust,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
as they've been overleveraged like everyone else,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
the difference is everything goes missing,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
documentation, passports,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and tickets home for these workers.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Currently, right now, thousands of workers are abandoned.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
There is no way back home.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And there is no way, and no proof of arrival.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
These are the boom-and-bust refugees.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
The question is, as a building professional,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
as an architect, an engineer, as a developer,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
if you know this is going on,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
as we go to the sights every single week,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
are you complacent or complicit

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
in the human rights violations?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
So let's forget your environmental footprint.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Let's think about your ethical footprint.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
What good is it

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
to build a zero-carbon, energy efficient complex,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
when the labor producing this architectural gem

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
is unethical at best?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Now, recently I've been told I've been taking the high road.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
But, quite frankly, on this issue,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
there is no other road.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
So let's not forget who is really paying the price of this financial collapse.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And that as we worry about our next job in the office,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
the next design that we can get, to keep our workers.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Let's not forget these men, who are truly dying to work.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Thank you.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
(Applause)
