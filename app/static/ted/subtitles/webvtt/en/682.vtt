00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:04.396
I'd like to talk to you today
about the scale of the scientific effort

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.100
that goes into making the headlines
you see in the paper.

00:00:07.124 --> 00:00:10.473
Headlines that look like this
when they have to do with climate change;

00:00:10.497 --> 00:00:13.343
and like this when they have to do
with air quality or smog.

00:00:13.367 --> 00:00:16.307
They're two branches of the same field
of atmospheric science.

00:00:16.331 --> 00:00:18.263
Recently, the headlines looked like this

00:00:18.287 --> 00:00:21.129
when the Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change, or IPCC,

00:00:21.153 --> 00:00:22.304
put out their report

00:00:22.328 --> 00:00:24.965
on the state of understanding
of the atmospheric system.

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:27.970
That report was written
by 620 scientists from 40 countries.

00:00:27.994 --> 00:00:30.495
They wrote almost
1,000 pages on the topic,

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:32.263
and all of those pages were reviewed

00:00:32.287 --> 00:00:34.414
by another 400-plus
scientists and reviewers

00:00:34.438 --> 00:00:36.132
from 113 countries.

00:00:36.156 --> 00:00:37.422
It's a big community;

00:00:37.446 --> 00:00:38.904
such a big community, in fact,

00:00:38.928 --> 00:00:42.383
that our annual gathering is the largest
scientific meeting in the world.

00:00:42.407 --> 00:00:45.361
Over 15,000 scientists go
to San Francisco every year for that.

00:00:45.385 --> 00:00:47.992
Every one of those scientists
is in a research group,

00:00:48.016 --> 00:00:50.745
and every research group studies
a wide variety of topics.

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:53.743
For us at Cambridge, it's as varied
as the El NiÃ±o Oscillation,

00:00:53.767 --> 00:00:55.431
which affects weather and climate,

00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:57.287
to the assimilation of satellite data,

00:00:57.311 --> 00:01:00.570
to emissions from crops that produce
biofuels, which is what I study.

00:01:00.594 --> 00:01:03.912
And in each one of these research areas,
of which there are even more,

00:01:03.936 --> 00:01:07.296
there are PhD students, like me,
and we study incredibly narrow topics,

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.917
things as narrow as a few processes
or a few molecules.

00:01:09.941 --> 00:01:13.155
And one of the molecules I study
is called isoprene, which is here.

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:14.826
It's a small organic molecule.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.494
You've probably never heard of it.

00:01:16.518 --> 00:01:18.920
The weight of a paper clip
is approximately equal

00:01:18.944 --> 00:01:22.575
to 900 zeta-illion -- 10 to the 21st --
molecules of isoprene.

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:24.698
But despite its very small weight,

00:01:24.722 --> 00:01:27.278
enough of it is emitted
into the atmosphere every year

00:01:27.302 --> 00:01:29.778
to equal the weight
of all the people on the planet.

00:01:29.802 --> 00:01:32.859
It's a huge amount of stuff.
It's equal to the weight of methane.

00:01:32.883 --> 00:01:34.364
And because it's so much stuff,

00:01:34.388 --> 00:01:36.702
it's really important
for the atmospheric system.

00:01:36.726 --> 00:01:39.022
Because it's important
to the atmospheric system,

00:01:39.046 --> 00:01:41.003
we go to all lengths to study this thing.

00:01:41.027 --> 00:01:42.798
We blow it up and look at the pieces.

00:01:42.822 --> 00:01:44.830
This is the EUPHORE Smog Chamber in Spain.

00:01:44.854 --> 00:01:46.878
Atmospheric explosions,
or full combustion,

00:01:46.902 --> 00:01:49.812
takes about 15,000 times longer
than what happens in your car.

00:01:49.836 --> 00:01:51.416
But still, we look at the pieces.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.785
We run enormous models on supercomputers;
this is what I happen to do.

00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:57.304
Our models have hundreds
of thousands of grid boxes

00:01:57.328 --> 00:02:00.335
calculating hundreds of variables
each, on minute timescales.

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:02.415
It takes weeks to perform
our integrations,

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:06.153
and we perform dozens of integrations
in order to understand what's happening.

00:02:06.177 --> 00:02:08.946
We also fly all over the world
looking for this thing.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.151
I recently joined a field campaign
in Malaysia -- there are others.

00:02:12.175 --> 00:02:14.374
We found a global atmospheric
watchtower there

00:02:14.398 --> 00:02:15.952
in the middle of the rainforest,

00:02:15.976 --> 00:02:19.379
and hung hundreds of thousands
of dollars' worth of scientific equipment

00:02:19.403 --> 00:02:20.554
off this tower,

00:02:20.578 --> 00:02:23.344
to look for isoprene and other things
while we were there.

00:02:23.368 --> 00:02:26.243
This is the tower in the middle
of the rainforest from above,

00:02:26.267 --> 00:02:27.467
and the tower from below.

00:02:27.491 --> 00:02:30.682
On part of that field campaign
we even brought an aircraft with us.

00:02:30.706 --> 00:02:33.373
And this plane, the model BAe-146,
which was run by FAAM,

00:02:33.397 --> 00:02:35.441
normally flies 120 to 130 people,

00:02:35.465 --> 00:02:38.050
so maybe you took a similar aircraft
to get here today.

00:02:38.074 --> 00:02:39.326
But we didn't just fly it.

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.043
We were flying at 100 meters
above the top of the canopy

00:02:42.067 --> 00:02:44.690
to measure this molecule --
incredibly dangerous stuff.

00:02:44.714 --> 00:02:47.607
We have to fly at a special incline
to make the measurements;

00:02:47.631 --> 00:02:50.222
we hire military and test pilots
to do the maneuvering;

00:02:50.246 --> 00:02:51.850
we need special flight clearance.

00:02:51.874 --> 00:02:54.027
As you come around the banks
in these valleys,

00:02:54.051 --> 00:02:55.587
the forces can get up to two Gs;

00:02:55.611 --> 00:02:57.771
the scientists must be
completely harnessed in

00:02:57.795 --> 00:02:59.894
in order to make measurements
while on board.

00:02:59.918 --> 00:03:01.072
So as you can imagine,

00:03:01.096 --> 00:03:04.503
the inside of the aircraft doesn't look
like one you'd take on vacation.

00:03:04.527 --> 00:03:08.073
It's a flying laboratory we took
to make measurements of this molecule.

00:03:08.097 --> 00:03:11.183
We do all this to understand
the chemistry of one molecule.

00:03:11.207 --> 00:03:13.891
And when one student like me
has some sort of inclination

00:03:13.915 --> 00:03:15.716
or understanding about that molecule,

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:17.957
they write one scientific paper
on the subject.

00:03:17.981 --> 00:03:21.201
And out of that field campaign
we'll probably get a few dozen papers

00:03:21.225 --> 00:03:23.062
on a few dozen processes or molecules.

00:03:23.086 --> 00:03:26.032
As a body of knowledge builds up,
it will form one subsection,

00:03:26.056 --> 00:03:27.207
or one sub-subsection,

00:03:27.231 --> 00:03:30.521
of an assessment like the IPCC,
although we have others.

00:03:30.545 --> 00:03:35.481
And each one of the 11 chapters
of the IPCC has six to ten subsections.

00:03:35.505 --> 00:03:37.545
So you can imagine
the scale of the effort.

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:41.232
In each one of the assessments we write,
we always tag on a summary,

00:03:41.256 --> 00:03:43.938
and the summary is written
for a non-scientific audience.

00:03:43.962 --> 00:03:46.702
And we hand that summary
to journalists and policy makers

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:48.596
in order to make headlines like these.

00:03:49.463 --> 00:03:50.651
Thank you very much.

00:03:50.675 --> 00:03:52.501
(Applause)
