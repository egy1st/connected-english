00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I started my journey 30 years ago.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
And I worked in mines. And I realized that

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
this was a world unseen.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And I wanted, through color and large format cameras

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and very large prints,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
to make a body of work that somehow

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
became symbols of our

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
use of the landscape,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
how we use the land.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And to me this was

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
a key component that somehow, through this medium of photography,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
which allows us to contemplate these landscapes,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
that I thought photography was perfectly suited

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
to doing this type of work.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And after 17 years of photographing large industrial landscapes,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
it occurred to me that

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
oil is underpinning the scale and speed.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Because that is what has changed,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
is the speed at which we're taking all our resources.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And so then I went out to develop a whole series

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
on the landscape of oil.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And what I want to do is to kind of map an arc

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
that there is extraction, where we're taking it from the ground,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
refinement. And that's one chapter.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
The other chapter that I wanted to look at was

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
how we use it -- our cities,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
our cars, our motorcultures,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
where people gather around the vehicle

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
as a celebration.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And then the third one is this idea of the end of oil,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
this entropic end,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
where all of our parts of cars, our tires,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
oil filters,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
helicopters, planes --

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
where are the landscapes where all of that stuff ends up?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And to me, again, photography was

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
a way in which I could explore and research the world,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and find those places.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And another idea that I had as well,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
that was brought forward by an ecologist --

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
he basically did a calculation where

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
he took one liter of gas and said,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
well, how much carbon it would take, and how much organic material?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
It was 23 metric tons for one liter.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So whenever I fill up my gas,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I think of that liter, and how much carbon.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And I know that oil comes from the ocean and phytoplankton,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
but he did the calculations for our Earth

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and what it had to do to produce that amount of energy.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
From the photosynthetic growth,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
it would take 500 years of that growth

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
to produce what we use, the 30 billion barrels we use per year.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And that also brought me to the fact that

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
this poses such a risk to our society.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Looking at 30 billion per year,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
we look at our two largest suppliers,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Saudi Arabia and now Canada, with its dirty oil.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And together they only form about 15 years of supply.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
The whole world, at 1.2 trillion estimated reserves,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
only gives us about 45 years.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
So, it's not a question of if, but a question of when

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
peak oil will come upon us.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
So, to me, using photography --

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and I feel that all of us need to now begin to really

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
take the task of using our talents,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
our ways of thinking,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
to begin to deal with what I think is probably

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
one of the most challenging issues of our time,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
how to deal with our energy crisis.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And I would like to say that, on the other side of it,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
30, 40 years from now, the children that I have,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I can look at them and say, "We did everything

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
we possibly, humanly could do,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
to begin to mitigate this,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
what I feel is one of the most important and critical

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
moments in our time. Thank you.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
(Applause)
