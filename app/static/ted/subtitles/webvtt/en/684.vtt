00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'd like to ask you,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
what do these three people have in common?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Well, you probably recognize the first person.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I'm sure you're all avid "American Idol" watchers.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
But you might not recognize Aydah Al Jahani,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
who is a contestant, indeed a finalist,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
in the Poet of the Millions competition,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
which is broadcast out of Abu Dhabi,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and seen throughout the Arab world.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
In this contest

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
people have to write and recite

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
original poetry, in the Nabati form of poetry,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
which is the traditional Bedouin form.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And Lima Sahar was a finalist

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
in the Afghan Star singing competition.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Now, before I go any further,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
yes, I know it all began with "Britain's Got Talent."

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
But my point in discussing this

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
is to show you -- I hope I'll be able to show you

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
how these merit-based competitions,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
with equal access to everyone,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
with the winner selected via voting by SMS,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
are changing tribal societies.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And I'm going to focus on Afghanistan

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and the Arab world with the UAE,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
how they're changing tribal societies,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
not by introducing Western ideas,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
but by being integrated into the language in those places.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
It all begins with enjoyment.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Video: We are late to watch "Afghan Star."

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
We are going to watch "Afghan Star." We are late.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
We are running late.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
We must go to watch "Afghan Star."

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Cynthia Schneider: These programs are reaching incredibly deeply into society.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
In Afghanistan, people go to extraordinary lengths

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
to be able to watch this program.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And you don't necessarily have to have your own TV set.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
People watch it all over the country

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
also in public places.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
But it goes beyond watching,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
because also, part of this

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
is campaigning.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
People become so engaged

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
that they have volunteers, just like political volunteers anyway,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
who fan out over the countryside,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
campaigning for their candidate.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Contestants also put themselves forward.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Now, of course there is a certain degree of ethnic allegiance, but not entirely.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Because each year the winner has come from a different tribal group.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
This has opened up the door,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
particularly for women.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And in the last season there were two women in the finalists.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
One of them, Lima Sahar, is a Pashtun from Kandahar,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
a very conservative part of the country.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And here she relates, in the documentary film "Afghan Star,"

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
how her friends urged her not to do this

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and told her that she was leaving them for democracy.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
But she also confides that

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
she knows that members of the Taliban

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
are actually SMS-ing votes in for her.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Aydah Al Jahnani also took risks

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and put herself out, to compete

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
in the Poet of the Millions competition.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
I have to say, her husband backed her from the start.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
But her tribe and family urged her not to compete

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
and were very much against it.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
But, once she started to win,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
then they got behind her again.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
It turns out that competition and winning is a universal human value.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And she's out there.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Her poetry is about women,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
and the life of women in society.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
So just by presenting herself

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
and being in competition with men --

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
this shows the voting on the program --

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
it sets a very important example for young women --

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
these are young women in the audience of the program --

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
in Abu Dhabi, but also people in the viewing audience.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Now you'd think that "American Idol"

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
would introduce a measure of Americanization.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
But actually, just the opposite is happening.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
By using this engaging popular format

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
for traditional, local culture,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
it actually, in the Gulf, is precipitating a revival

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
of interest in Nabati poetry,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
also in traditional dress and dance and music.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And for Afghanistan,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
where the Taliban banned music for many years,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
it is reintroducing their traditional music.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
They don't sing pop songs,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
they sing Afghan music.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And they also have learned how to lose gracefully,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
without avenging the winner.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
(Laughter)

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
No small thing.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000
And the final, sort of, formulation

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
of this "American Idol" format,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
which has just appeared in Afghanistan,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
is a new program called "The Candidate."

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And in this program, people present

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
policy platforms that are then voted on.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Many of them are too young to run for president,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
but by putting the issues out there,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
they are influencing the presidential race.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
So for me, the substance of things unseen

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
is how reality TV is driving reality.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Thank you.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000
(Applause)
