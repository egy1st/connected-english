WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.976
We grew up

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.976
interacting with the physical
objects around us.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.400
There are an enormous number of them
that we use every day.

00:00:09.293 --> 00:00:11.976
Unlike most of our computing devices,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.253
these objects are much more fun to use.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.976
When you talk about objects,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.976
one other thing automatically
comes attached to that thing,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.976
and that is gestures:

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.976
how we manipulate these objects,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.976
how we use these objects in everyday life.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.976
We use gestures not only to interact
with these objects,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.286
but we also use them
to interact with each other.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.976
A gesture of "Namaste!",
maybe, to respect someone, or maybe,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.429
in India I don't need to teach
a kid that this means

00:00:39.453 --> 00:00:40.976
"four runs" in cricket.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.523
It comes as a part
of our everyday learning.

00:00:44.456 --> 00:00:47.976
So, I am very interested,
from the beginning,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.976
how our knowledge
about everyday objects and gestures,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.976
and how we use these objects,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.976
can be leveraged to our interactions
with the digital world.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.976
Rather than using a keyboard and mouse,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.976
why can I not use my computer

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.976
in the same way that I interact
in the physical world?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.976
So, I started this exploration
around eight years back,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.976
and it literally started
with a mouse on my desk.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.976
Rather than using it for my computer,
I actually opened it.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.191
Most of you might be aware
that, in those days,

00:01:20.215 --> 00:01:22.215
the mouse used to come with a ball inside,

00:01:22.239 --> 00:01:23.976
and there were two rollers

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.976
that actually guide the computer
where the ball is moving,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.096
and, accordingly,
where the mouse is moving.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.976
So, I was interested in these two rollers,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.381
and I actually wanted more, so I borrowed
another mouse from a friend --

00:01:35.405 --> 00:01:36.976
never returned to him --

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.976
and I now had four rollers.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.976
Interestingly, what I did
with these rollers is,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.976
basically, I took them off of these mouses
and then put them in one line.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.976
It had some strings
and pulleys and some springs.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.976
What I got is basically
a gesture-interface device

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.976
that actually acts
as a motion-sensing device

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.976
made for two dollars.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.976
So, here, whatever movement
I do in my physical world

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.976
is actually replicated
inside the digital world

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.096
just using this small device
that I made, around eight years back,

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.976
in 2000.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.667
Because I was interested
in integrating these two worlds,

00:02:12.691 --> 00:02:13.976
I thought of sticky notes.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.976
I thought, "Why can I not connect

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.143
the normal interface
of a physical sticky note

00:02:19.167 --> 00:02:20.976
to the digital world?"

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.148
A message written
on a sticky note to my mom,

00:02:23.172 --> 00:02:24.376
on paper,

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.976
can come to an SMS,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.976
or maybe a meeting reminder

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.191
automatically syncs
with my digital calendar --

00:02:30.215 --> 00:02:32.976
a to-do list that automatically
syncs with you.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.976
But you can also search
in the digital world,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.976
or maybe you can write a query, saying,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.976
"What is Dr. Smith's address?"

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.191
and this small system
actually prints it out --

00:02:42.215 --> 00:02:44.692
so it actually acts like a paper
input-output system,

00:02:44.716 --> 00:02:47.501
just made out of paper.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.976
In another exploration,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.976
I thought of making a pen
that can draw in three dimensions.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.976
So, I implemented this pen
that can help designers and architects

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.976
not only think in three dimensions,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.976
but they can actually draw,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.048
so that it's more intuitive
to use that way.

00:03:05.072 --> 00:03:07.120
Then I thought,
"Why not make a Google Map,

00:03:07.144 --> 00:03:08.976
but in the physical world?"

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.976
Rather than typing a keyword
to find something,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.976
I put my objects on top of it.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.191
If I put a boarding pass, it will show me
where the flight gate is.

00:03:17.215 --> 00:03:19.976
A coffee cup will show
where you can find more coffee,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.976
or where you can trash the cup.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.976
So, these were some
of the earlier explorations I did

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
because the goal was to connect
these two worlds seamlessly.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.976
Among all these experiments,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.976
there was one thing in common:

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.505
I was trying to bring
a part of the physical world

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:38.027
to the digital world.

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:39.976
I was taking some part of the objects,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.977
or any of the intuitiveness of real life,

00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:45.190
and bringing them to the digital world,

00:03:45.214 --> 00:03:49.239
because the goal was to make
our computing interfaces more intuitive.

00:03:49.263 --> 00:03:53.976
But then I realized that we humans
are not actually interested in computing.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.976
What we are interested in is information.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.976
We want to know about things.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.381
We want to know about
dynamic things going around.

00:04:01.405 --> 00:04:05.976
So I thought, around last year --
in the beginning of the last year --

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.477
I started thinking, "Why can I not take
this approach in the reverse way?"

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:12.176
Maybe, "How about I take my digital world

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.976
and paint the physical world
with that digital information?"

00:04:18.154 --> 00:04:21.776
Because pixels are actually, right now,
confined in these rectangular devices

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.547
that fit in our pockets.

00:04:23.571 --> 00:04:25.976
Why can I not remove this confine

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.976
and take that to my everyday
objects, everyday life

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.143
so that I don't need
to learn the new language

00:04:31.167 --> 00:04:32.964
for interacting with those pixels?

00:04:34.214 --> 00:04:36.976
So, in order to realize this dream,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.976
I actually thought of putting
a big-size projector on my head.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.239
I think that's why this is called
a head-mounted projector, isn't it?

00:04:43.263 --> 00:04:44.976
I took it very literally,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.976
and took my bike helmet,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.381
put a little cut over there so that
the projector actually fits nicely.

00:04:50.405 --> 00:04:51.976
So now, what I can do --

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.805
I can augment the world around me
with this digital information.

00:04:56.658 --> 00:04:57.876
But later,

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.059
I realized that I actually
wanted to interact

00:05:00.083 --> 00:05:01.676
with those digital pixels, also.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.976
So I put a small camera over there
that acts as a digital eye.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.976
Later, we moved to a much better,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
consumer-oriented pendant version of that,

00:05:09.024 --> 00:05:11.976
that many of you now know
as the SixthSense device.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.976
But the most interesting thing
about this particular technology

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.976
is that you can carry
your digital world with you

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.976
wherever you go.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.976
You can start using any surface,
any wall around you,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.976
as an interface.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.976
The camera is actually tracking
all your gestures.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.976
Whatever you're doing with your hands,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.976
it's understanding that gesture.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.576
And, actually, if you see,
there are some color markers

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.076
that in the beginning version
we are using with it.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.976
You can start painting on any wall.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.976
You stop by a wall,
and start painting on that wall.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.143
But we are not only tracking
one finger, here.

00:05:45.167 --> 00:05:48.976
We are giving you the freedom
of using all of both of your hands,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.143
so you can actually use both of your hands
to zoom into or zoom out

00:05:52.167 --> 00:05:54.143
of a map just by pinching all present.

00:05:54.167 --> 00:05:57.976
The camera is actually doing --
just, getting all the images --

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.976
is doing the edge recognition
and also the color recognition

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.976
and so many other small algorithms
are going on inside.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
So, technically,
it's a little bit complex,

00:06:06.024 --> 00:06:09.500
but it gives you an output which is more
intuitive to use, in some sense.

00:06:09.524 --> 00:06:12.376
But I'm more excited that you can
actually take it outside.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.976
Rather than getting your camera
out of your pocket,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.976
you can just do the gesture
of taking a photo,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.976
and it takes a photo for you.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.976
(Applause)

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Thank you.

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:27.976
And later I can find a wall, anywhere,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.976
and start browsing those photos

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.676
or maybe, "OK, I want to modify
this photo a little bit

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.686
and send it as an email to a friend."

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.976
So, we are looking for an era

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.976
where computing will actually merge
with the physical world.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.976
And, of course,
if you don't have any surface,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.976
you can start using your palm
for simple operations.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.477
Here, I'm dialing a phone number
just using my hand.

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.976
The camera is actually not
only understanding your hand movements,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.176
but, interestingly,

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.439
is also able to understand what objects
you are holding in your hand.

00:07:00.009 --> 00:07:03.976
For example, in this case,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.976
the book cover is matched

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.976
with so many thousands,
or maybe millions of books online,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.976
and checking out which book it is.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.476
Once it has that information,

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.376
it finds out more reviews about that,

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.976
or maybe New York Times
has a sound overview on that,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.096
so you can actually hear,
on a physical book,

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.976
a review as sound.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.176
(Video) Famous talk
at Harvard University --

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.976
This was Obama's visit last week to MIT.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.465
(Video) And particularly I want
to thank two outstanding MIT --

00:07:30.489 --> 00:07:33.523
Pranav Mistry: So, I was seeing
the live [video] of his talk,

00:07:33.547 --> 00:07:35.489
outside, on just a newspaper.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.976
Your newspaper will show you
live weather information

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.606
rather than having it updated.

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:44.477
You have to check your computer
in order to do that, right?

00:07:44.501 --> 00:07:48.976
(Applause)

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.976
When I'm going back,
I can just use my boarding pass

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.096
to check how much my flight
has been delayed,

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.976
because at that particular time,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.976
I'm not feeling like opening my iPhone,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.976
and checking out a particular icon.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.134
And I think this technology
will not only change the way --

00:08:03.158 --> 00:08:04.134
(Laughter)

00:08:04.158 --> 00:08:05.176
Yes.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:07.678
It will change the way
we interact with people, also,

00:08:07.702 --> 00:08:09.217
not only the physical world.

00:08:09.241 --> 00:08:11.976
The fun part is, I'm going
to the Boston metro,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.976
and playing a pong game inside the train
on the ground, right?

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.076
(Laughter)

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.196
And I think the imagination
is the only limit

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:21.976
of what you can think of

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.476
when this kind of technology
merges with real life.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.376
But many of you argue, actually,

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.076
that all of our work is not
only about physical objects.

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:32.076
We actually do lots
of accounting and paper editing

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.391
and all those kinds of things;
what about that?

00:08:34.415 --> 00:08:37.976
And many of you are excited
about the next-generation tablet computers

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.976
to come out in the market.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.976
So, rather than waiting for that,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.976
I actually made my own,
just using a piece of paper.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
So, what I did here
is remove the camera --

00:08:47.024 --> 00:08:50.976
All the webcam cameras have
a microphone inside the camera.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.976
I removed the microphone from that,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.976
and then just pinched that --

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.976
like I just made a clip
out of the microphone --

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.976
and clipped that to a piece of paper,
any paper that you found around.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.976
So now the sound of the touch

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.976
is getting me when exactly
I'm touching the paper.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.976
But the camera is actually tracking
where my fingers are moving.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.976
You can of course watch movies.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.976
(Video) Good afternoon.
My name is Russell,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.976
and I am a Wilderness
Explorer in Tribe 54."

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.976
PM: And you can of course play games.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.976
(Car engine)

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.334
Here, the camera is actually understanding
how you're holding the paper

00:09:31.358 --> 00:09:32.976
and playing a car-racing game.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
(Applause)

00:09:37.396 --> 00:09:40.174
Many of you already must have
thought, OK, you can browse.

00:09:40.198 --> 00:09:42.476
Yeah. Of course you can
browse to any websites

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:45.176
or you can do all sorts
of computing on a piece of paper

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.376
wherever you need it.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.976
So, more interestingly,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.976
I'm interested in how we can
take that in a more dynamic way.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.976
When I come back to my desk,
I can just pinch that information

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.976
back to my desktop

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.976
so I can use my full-size computer.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.976
(Applause)

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.976
And why only computers?
We can just play with papers.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.976
Paper world is interesting to play with.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.976
Here, I'm taking a part of a document,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.976
and putting over here a second part
from a second place,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.976
and I'm actually modifying the information
that I have over there.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.976
Yeah. And I say, "OK, this looks nice,
let me print it out, that thing."

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.381
So I now have a print-out of that thing.

00:10:26.405 --> 00:10:28.729
So the workflow is more intuitive,

00:10:28.753 --> 00:10:31.976
the way we used to do it
maybe 20 years back,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.976
rather than now switching
between these two worlds.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.976
So, as a last thought,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.376
I think that integrating
information to everyday objects

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.976
will not only help us to get rid
of the digital divide,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.976
the gap between these two worlds,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.976
but will also help us, in some way,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.976
to stay human,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
to be more connected
to our physical world.

00:10:58.408 --> 00:11:00.976
And it will actually help us
not end up being machines

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.718
sitting in front of other machines.

00:11:03.507 --> 00:11:05.976
That's all. Thank you.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:19.976
(Applause)

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.176
Thank you.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.976
(Applause)

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.976
Chris Anderson: So, Pranav,
first of all, you're a genius.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.976
This is incredible, really.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.100
What are you doing with this?
Is there a company being planned?

00:11:34.124 --> 00:11:35.976
Or is this research forever, or what?

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.276
Pranav Mistry: So, there are
lots of companies,

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:41.296
sponsor companies of Media Lab
interested in taking this ahead

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.506
in one or another way.

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:44.503
Companies like mobile-phone operators

00:11:44.527 --> 00:11:47.401
want to take this in a different way
than the NGOs in India,

00:11:47.425 --> 00:11:49.601
thinking, "Why can we only
have 'Sixth Sense'?

00:11:49.625 --> 00:11:53.076
We should have a 'Fifth Sense'
for missing-sense people who cannot speak.

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:56.391
This technology can be used for them
to speak out in a different way

00:11:56.415 --> 00:11:57.691
maybe a speaker system."

00:11:57.715 --> 00:12:00.176
CA: What are your own plans?
Are you staying at MIT,

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.276
or are you going to do
something with this?

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:04.829
PM: I'm trying to make this
more available to people

00:12:04.853 --> 00:12:07.529
so that anyone can develop
their own SixthSense device,

00:12:07.553 --> 00:12:10.976
because the hardware is actually
not that hard to manufacture

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.976
or hard to make your own.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.572
We will provide all the open source
software for them,

00:12:15.596 --> 00:12:16.976
maybe starting next month.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.976
CA: Open source? Wow.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.976
(Applause)

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.429
CA: Are you going to come back to India
with some of this, at some point?

00:12:27.453 --> 00:12:28.976
PM: Yeah. Yes, yes, of course.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.976
CA: What are your plans? MIT? India?

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.476
How are you going to split
your time going forward?

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:35.976
PM: There is a lot of energy here.
Lots of learning.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.976
All of this work that you have seen
is all about my learning in India.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.976
And now, if you see, it's more about
the cost-effectiveness:

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.976
this system costs you $300

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.976
compared to the $20,000 surface tables,
or anything like that.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.976
Or maybe even the $2 mouse gesture system
at that time was costing around $5,000?

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.976
I showed that, at a conference,
to President Abdul Kalam, at that time,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.524
and then he said, "OK, we should use this
in Bhabha Atomic Research Centre

00:13:03.548 --> 00:13:04.976
for some use of that."

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.096
So I'm excited about how I can bring
the technology to the masses

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:11.120
rather than just keeping that technology
in the lab environment.

00:13:11.144 --> 00:13:14.976
(Applause)

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.118
CA: Based on the people we've seen at TED,

00:13:17.142 --> 00:13:19.476
I would say you're truly
one of the two or three

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.376
best inventors in the world right now.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.976
It's an honor to have you at TED.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.976
Thank you so much.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.176
That's fantastic.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:30.000
(Applause)
