00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
To understand the business of mythology

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and what a Chief Belief Officer is supposed to do,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
you have to hear a story

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
of Ganesha,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
the elephant-headed god

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
who is the scribe of storytellers,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and his brother,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
the athletic warlord of the gods,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Kartikeya.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The two brothers one day decided to go on a race,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
three times around the world.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Kartikeya leapt on his peacock

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and flew around the continents

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and the mountains and the oceans.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
He went around once,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
he went around twice,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
he went around thrice.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
But his brother, Ganesha,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
simply walked around his parents

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
once, twice, thrice,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and said, "I won."

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
"How come?" said Kartikeya.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And Ganesha said,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
"You went around 'the world.'

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I went around 'my world.'"

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
What matters more?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
If you understand the difference between 'the world' and 'my world,'

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
you understand the difference between logos and mythos.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
'The world' is objective,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
logical, universal, factual,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
scientific.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
'My world' is subjective.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
It's emotional. It's personal.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
It's perceptions, thoughts, feelings, dreams.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
It is the belief system that we carry.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
It's the myth that we live in.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
'The world' tells us how the world functions,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
how the sun rises,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
how we are born.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
'My world' tells us why the sun rises,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
why we were born.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Every culture is trying to understand itself:

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
"Why do we exist?"

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And every culture comes up with its own understanding of life,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
its own customized version of mythology.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Culture is a reaction to nature,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and this understanding of our ancestors

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
is transmitted generation from generation

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
in the form of stories, symbols and rituals,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000
which are always indifferent to rationality.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And so, when you study it, you realize

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
that different people of the world

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
have a different understanding of the world.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Different people see things differently --

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
different viewpoints.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
There is my world and there is your world,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and my world is always better than your world,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
because my world, you see, is rational

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
and yours is superstition.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Yours is faith.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Yours is illogical.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
This is the root of the clash of civilizations.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
It took place, once, in 326 B.C.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
on the banks of a river called the Indus,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
now in Pakistan.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
This river lends itself to India's name.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
India. Indus.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Alexander, a young Macedonian,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
met there what he called a "gymnosophist,"

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
which means "the naked, wise man."

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
We don't know who he was.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Perhaps he was a Jain monk,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
like Bahubali over here,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000
the Gomateshwara Bahubali

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
whose image is not far from Mysore.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Or perhaps he was just a yogi

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
who was sitting on a rock, staring at the sky

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
and the sun and the moon.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Alexander asked, "What are you doing?"

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and the gymnosophist answered,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
"I'm experiencing nothingness."

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Then the gymnosophist asked,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
"What are you doing?"

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
and Alexander said, "I am conquering the world."

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
And they both laughed.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Each one thought that the other was a fool.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
The gymnosophist said, "Why is he conquering the world?

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
It's pointless."

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And Alexander thought,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
"Why is he sitting around, doing nothing?

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
What a waste of a life."

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
To understand this difference in viewpoints,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
we have to understand

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
the subjective truth of Alexander --

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
his myth, and the mythology that constructed it.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Alexander's mother, his parents, his teacher Aristotle

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
told him the story of Homer's "Iliad."

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
They told him of a great hero called Achilles,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
who, when he participated in battle, victory was assured,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
but when he withdrew from the battle,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
defeat was inevitable.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
"Achilles was a man who could shape history,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
a man of destiny,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
and this is what you should be, Alexander."

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
That's what he heard.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
"What should you not be?

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
You should not be Sisyphus,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
who rolls a rock up a mountain all day

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
only to find the boulder rolled down at night.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Don't live a life which is monotonous,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
mediocre, meaningless.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Be spectacular! --

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
like the Greek heroes,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
like Jason, who went across the sea

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
with the Argonauts and fetched the Golden Fleece.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Be spectacular like Theseus,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.000
who entered the labyrinth and killed the bull-headed Minotaur.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
When you play in a race, win! --

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
because when you win, the exhilaration of victory

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
is the closest you will come to the ambrosia of the gods."

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Because, you see, the Greeks believed

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
you live only once,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
and when you die, you have to cross the River Styx.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
And if you have lived an extraordinary life,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
you will be welcomed to Elysium,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
or what the French call "Champs-Élysées" --

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000
(Laughter) --

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
the heaven of the heroes.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
But these are not the stories that the gymnosophist heard.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
He heard a very different story.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
He heard of a man called Bharat,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
after whom India is called Bhārata.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Bharat also conquered the world.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
And then he went to the top-most peak

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
of the greatest mountain of the center of the world

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000
called Meru.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
And he wanted to hoist his flag to say,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
"I was here first."

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
But when he reached the mountain peak,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
he found the peak covered with countless flags

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
of world-conquerors before him,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
each one claiming "'I was here first' ...

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
that's what I thought until I came here."

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
And suddenly, in this canvas of infinity,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Bharat felt insignificant.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
This was the mythology of the gymnosophist.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
You see, he had heroes, like Ram -- Raghupati Ram

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and Krishna, Govinda Hari.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
But they were not two characters on two different adventures.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
They were two lifetimes of the same hero.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
When the Ramayana ends the Mahabharata begins.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
When Ram dies, Krishna is born.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
When Krishna dies, eventually he will be back as Ram.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
You see, the Indians also had a river

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
that separates the land of the living from the land of the dead.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
But you don't cross it once.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
You go to and fro endlessly.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
It was called the Vaitarani.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
You go again and again and again.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Because, you see,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
nothing lasts forever in India, not even death.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
And so, you have these grand rituals

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
where great images of mother goddesses are built

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
and worshiped for 10 days ...

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
And what do you do at the end of 10 days?

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
You dunk it in the river.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Because it has to end.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
And next year, she will come back.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
What goes around always comes around,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
and this rule applies not just to man,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
but also the gods.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
You see, the gods

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
have to come back again and again and again

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
as Ram, as Krishna.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Not only do they live infinite lives,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
but the same life is lived infinite times

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000
till you get to the point of it all.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
"Groundhog Day."

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
(Laughter)

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Two different mythologies.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Which is right?

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Two different mythologies, two different ways of looking at the world.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
One linear, one cyclical.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
One believes this is the one and only life.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
The other believes this is one of many lives.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And so, the denominator of Alexander's life was one.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
So, the value of his life was the sum total

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
of his achievements.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
The denominator of the gymnosophist's life was infinity.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
So, no matter what he did,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
it was always zero.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And I believe it is this mythological paradigm

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
that inspired Indian mathematicians

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
to discover the number zero.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Who knows?

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
And that brings us to the mythology of business.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
If Alexander's belief influenced his behavior,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
if the gymnosophist's belief influences his behavior,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000
then it was bound to influence the business they were in.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
You see, what is business

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
but the result of how the market behaves

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
and how the organization behaves?

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
And if you look at cultures around the world,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
all you have to do is understand the mythology

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
and you will see how they behave and how they do business.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Take a look.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
If you live only once, in one-life cultures around the world,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
you will see an obsession with binary logic,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
absolute truth, standardization,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
absoluteness, linear patterns in design.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
But if you look at cultures which have cyclical

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
and based on infinite lives, you will see a comfort with fuzzy logic,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
with opinion,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
with contextual thinking,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
with everything is relative, sort of --

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000
(Laughter)

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
mostly.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000
(Laughter)

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
You look at art. Look at the ballerina,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
how linear she is in her performance.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
And then look at the Indian classical dancer,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
the Kuchipudi dancer, the Bharatanatyam dancer,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
curvaceous.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
(Laughter)

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
And then look at business.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Standard business model:

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
vision, mission, values, processes.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Sounds very much like the journey through

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
the wilderness to the promised land,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
with the commandments held by the leader.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000
And if you comply, you will go to heaven.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
But in India there is no "the" promised land.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
There are many promised lands,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
depending on your station in society,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
depending on your stage of life.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
You see, businesses are not run as institutions,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
by the idiosyncrasies of individuals.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
It's always about taste.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
It's always about my taste.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
You see, Indian music, for example,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
does not have the concept of harmony.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
There is no orchestra conductor.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
There is one performer standing there, and everybody follows.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
And you can never replicate that performance twice.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
It is not about documentation and contract.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
It's about conversation and faith.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
It's not about compliance. It's about setting,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
getting the job done, by bending or breaking the rules --

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
just look at your Indian people around here,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
you'll see them smile; they know what it is.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000
(Laughter)

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
And then look at people who have done business in India,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
you'll see the exasperation on their faces.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000
(Laughter)

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
(Applause)

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
You see, this is what India is today. The ground reality

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
is based on a cyclical world view.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
So, it's rapidly changing, highly diverse,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
chaotic, ambiguous, unpredictable.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
And people are okay with it.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
And then globalization is taking place.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
The demands of modern institutional thinking is coming in.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Which is rooted in one-life culture.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
And a clash is going to take place,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
like on the banks of the Indus.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
It is bound to happen.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
I have personally experienced it. I'm trained as a medical doctor.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
I did not want to study surgery. Don't ask me why.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
I love mythology too much.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
I wanted to learn mythology. But there is nowhere you can study.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
So, I had to teach it to myself.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
And mythology does not pay, well, until now.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
(Laughter)

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
So, I had to take up a job. And I worked in the pharma industry.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
And I worked in the healthcare industry.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
And I worked as a marketing guy, and a sales guy,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
and a knowledge guy, and a content guy, and a training guy.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
I even was a business consultant, doing strategies and tactics.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
And I would see the exasperation

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
between my American and European colleagues,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
when they were dealing with India.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Example: Please tell us the process

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
to invoice hospitals.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Step A. Step B. Step C. Mostly.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
(Laughter)

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
How do you parameterize "mostly"?

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
How do you put it in a nice little software? You can't.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
I would give my viewpoints to people.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
But nobody was interested in listening to it,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
you see, until I met Kishore Biyani of the Future group.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000
You see, he has established the largest retail chain, called Big Bazaar.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
And there are more than 200 formats,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
across 50 cities and towns of India.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
And he was dealing with diverse and dynamic markets.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
And he knew very intuitively,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
that best practices,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
developed in Japan and China and Europe and America

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
will not work in India.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
He knew that institutional thinking doesn't work in India. Individual thinking does.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
He had an intuitive understanding of the mythic structure of India.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
So, he had asked me to be the Chief Belief Officer, and said,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
"All I want to do is align belief."

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Sounds so simple.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
But belief is not measurable.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
You can't measure it. You can't manage it.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
So, how do you construct belief?

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:39.000
How do you enhance the sensitivity of people to Indian-ness.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Even if you are Indian, it is not very explicit, it is not very obvious.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
So, I tried to work on the standard model of culture,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
which is, develop stories, symbols and rituals.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
And I will share one of the rituals with you.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
You see it is based on the Hindu ritual of Darshan.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Hindus don't have the concept of commandments.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
So, there is nothing right or wrong in what you do in life.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
So, you're not really sure how you stand in front of God.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
So, when you go to the temple, all you seek is an audience with God.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
You want to see God.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
And you want God to see you, and hence the gods have very large eyes,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
large unblinking eyes,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
sometimes made of silver,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
so they look at you.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Because you don't know whether you're right or wrong, and so all you seek

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
is divine empathy.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
"Just know where I came from, why I did the Jugaad."

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000
(Laughter)

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
"Why did I do the setting,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000
why I don't care for the processes. Just understand me, please."

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
And based on this, we created a ritual for leaders.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
After a leader completes his training and is about to take over the store,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
we blindfold him, we surround him with the stakeholders,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
the customer, his family, his team, his boss.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
You read out his KRA, his KPI, you give him the keys,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
and then you remove the blindfold.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
And invariably, you see a tear,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
because the penny has dropped.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
He realizes that to succeed,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
he does not have to be a "professional,"

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
he does not have to cut out his emotions,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
he has to include all these people

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000
in his world to succeed, to make them happy,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
to make the boss happy, to make everyone happy.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
The customer is happy, because the customer is God.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
That sensitivity is what we need. Once this belief enters,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
behavior will happen, business will happen.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
And it has.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
So, then we come back to Alexander

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
and to the gymnosophist.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
And everybody asks me, "Which is the better way, this way or that way?"

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
And it's a very dangerous question,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
because it leads you to the path of fundamentalism and violence.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
So, I will not answer the question.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
What I will give you is an Indian answer,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
the Indian head-shake.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
(Laughter)

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
(Applause)

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Depending on the context,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
depending on the outcome,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
choose your paradigm.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
You see, because both the paradigms are human constructions.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
They are cultural creations,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
not natural phenomena.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
And so the next time you meet someone, a stranger,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
one request:

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Understand that you live in the subjective truth,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
and so does he.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Understand it.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000
And when you understand it you will discover something spectacular.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
You will discover that within infinite myths

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
lies the eternal truth.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Who sees it all?

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
Varuna has but a thousand eyes.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
Indra, a hundred.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
You and I, only two.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Thank you. Namaste.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:18:05.000
(Applause)
