00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
One day a one-eyed monkey came into the forest.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Under a tree she saw a woman

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
meditating furiously.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The one-eyed monkey recognized the woman, a Sekhri.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
She was the wife of an even more famous Brahmin.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
To watch her better, the one-eyed monkey climbed onto the tree.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Just then, with a loud bang,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
the heavens opened. (Claps)

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And the god Indra jumped into the clearing.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Indra saw the woman, a Sekhri.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Ah-hah.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
The woman paid him no heed.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So, Indra, attracted, threw her onto the floor,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and proceeded to rape her.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Then Indra disappeared. (Clap! Clap!)

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And the woman's husband, the Brahmin, appeared.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
He realized at once what had happened.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
So, he petitioned the higher gods

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
so that he may have justice.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So, the god Vishnu arrived.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
"Are there any witnesses?"

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
"Just a one-eyed monkey," said the Brahmin.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Now, the one-eyed monkey

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
really wanted for the woman, a Sekhri, to get justice,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
so she retold events exactly as they had happened.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Vishnu gave his judgment.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
"The god Indra has sinned,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
in that he has sinned against ... a Brahmin.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
May he be called to wash away his sins."

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
So, Indra arrived,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and performed the sacrifice of the horse.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And so it transpired

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
that a horse was killed,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
a god was made sin-free,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
a Brahmin's ego was appeased,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
a woman ... was ruined,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and a one-eyed monkey was left ...

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
very confused at what we humans call justice.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
In India there is a rape every three minutes.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
In India, only 25 percent of rapes

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
come to a police station,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and of these 25 percent that come to a police station,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
convictions are only in four percent of the cases.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
That's a lot of women who don't get justice.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And it's not only about women.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Look around you, look at your own countries.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
There is a certain pattern in who gets charged with crimes.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
If you're in Australia, it's mostly aboriginals who are in jail.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
If you're in India, it's either Muslims or Adivasis,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
our tribals, the Naxalites.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000
If you're in the U.S., it's mostly the blacks.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
There is a trend here.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And the Brahmins and the gods, like in my story,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
always get to tell their truth as The Truth.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
So, have we all become

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
one-eyed -- two-eyed instead of one-eyed -- monkeys?

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Have we stopped seeing injustice?

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Good morning.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
(Applause)

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
You know, I have told this story

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
close to 550 times,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
in audiences in 40 countries,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
to school students, to black-tie dinners at the Smithsonian, and so on and so forth,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
and every time it hits something.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Now, if I were to go into the same crowd

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
and say, "I want to lecture you about justice and injustice,"

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
they would say, "Thank you very much, we have other things to do."

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And that is the astonishing power of art.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Art can go through where other things can't.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
You can't have barriers, because it breaks through your prejudices,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
breaks through everything that you have as your mask,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
that says, "I am this, I am that, I am that."

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
No. It breaks through those.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And it reaches somewhere where other things don't.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
And in a world where attitudes are so difficult to change,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
we need a language that reaches through.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Hitler knew it; he used Wagner

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
to make all the Nazis feel wonderful and Aryan.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And Mr. Berlusconi knows it, as he sits atop

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
this huge empire of media and television and so on and so forth.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
And all of the wonderful creative minds who are in all the advertising agencies,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
and who help corporate sell us things we absolutely don't require,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
they also know the power of the arts.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
For me it came very early.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
When I was a young child, my mother, who was a choreographer,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
came upon a phenomenon that worried her.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
It was a phenomenon where young brides

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
were committing suicide in rural Gujarat,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
because they were being forced to bring more and more money for their in-laws' families.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
And she created a dance piece which then Prime Minister Nehru saw.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
He came to talk to her and said, "What is this about?"

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
She told him and he set out the first inquiry

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
into what today we call Dowry Dance.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Imagine a dance piece

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
for the first inquiry into something

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
that even today kills thousands of women.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Many years later, when I was working with the director Peter Brook

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
in "The Mahabharata" playing this feisty feminine feminist

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
called Draupadi, I had similar experiences.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Big fat black mamas in the Bronx

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
used to come and say, "Hey girl, that's it!"

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
And then these trendy young things in the Sorbonne would say,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
"Madame Draupadi, on n'est pas feministe, mais ça? Ça!"

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
And then aboriginal women in Africa

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
would come and say, "This is it!"

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
And I thought, "This is what we need,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
as a language."

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
We had somebody from public health. And Devdutt also mentioned public health.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Well, millions of people around the world die

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
of waterborne disease every year.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
And that's because there is no clean water to drink,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
or in countries like India,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
people don't know that they need to soap their hands before defecation.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
So, what do they do?

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
They drink the water they know is dirty,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
they get cholera, they get diarrhea, they get jaundice

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
and they die.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And governments have not been able to provide clean water.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
They try and build it. They try and build pipelines; it doesn't happen.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
And the MNCs give them machines that they cannot afford.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
So what do you do? Do you let them die?

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Well, somebody had a great idea.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And it was a simple idea. It was an idea that could not profit anybody

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
but would help health in every field.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Most houses in Asia and India

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
have a cotton garment.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
And it was discovered, and WHO endorses this,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
that a clean cotton garment folded eight times over,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
can reduce bacteria up to 80 percent from water sieved through.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
So, why aren't governments blaring this on television?

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Why isn't it on every poster across the third world?

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Because there is no profit in it.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Because nobody can get a kickback.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
But it still needs to get to people.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
And here is one of the ways we get it to people.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
[Video] Woman: Then get me one of those fancy water purifiers.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Man: You know how expensive those are.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
I have a solution that requires neither machine,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
nor wood, nor cooking gas.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Woman: What solution?

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Man: Listen, go fetch that cotton sari you have.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Boy: Grand-dad, tell me the solution please.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Man: I will tell all of you. Just wait.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Woman: Here father. (Man: Is it clean?) Woman: Yes, of course.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Man: Then do as I tell you. Fold the sari into eight folds.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Woman: All right, father.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Man: And you, you count that she does it right. (Boy: All right, grand-dad.)

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Man: One, two, three, four folds we make.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
All the germs from the water we take.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Chorus: One, two, three, four folds we make.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
All the germs from the water we take.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Five, six, seven, eight folds we make.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Our drinking water safe we make.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Five, six, seven, eight folds we make.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Our drinking water safe we make.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Woman: Here, father, your eight-times folded cotton sari.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Man: So this is the cotton sari.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And through this we will have clean water.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
(Applause)

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
I think it's safe to say that all of us here

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000
are deeply concerned about the escalating violence in our daily lives.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
While universities are trying to devise courses in conflict resolution,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
and governments are trying to stop skirmishes at borders,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
we are surrounded by violence, whether it's road rage,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
or whether it's domestic violence,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
whether it's a teacher beating up a student and killing her

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
because she hasn't done her homework, it's everywhere.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
So, why are we not doing something

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
to actually attend that problem on a day to day basis?

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
What are we doing to try and make children

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
and young people realize

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
that violence is something that we indulge in,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
that we can stop,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
and that there are other ways of actually

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
taking violence, taking anger, taking frustrations

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
into different things that do not harm other people.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Well, here is one such way.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
(Video) (Laughs) You are peaceful people.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Your parents were peaceful people.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Your grandparents were peaceful people.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
So much peace in one place?

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
How could it be otherwise?

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
(Music)

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
But, what if ...

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Yes. What if ...

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
One little gene in you

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
has been trying to get through?

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
From your beginnings in Africa,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
through each generation, may be passed on to you,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
in your creation. It's a secret urge, hiding deep in you.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.000
And if it's in you, then it's in me too. Oh, dear.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
It's what made you smack your baby brother,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
stamp on a cockroach, scratch your mother.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
It's the feeling that wells up from deep inside,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
when your husband comes home drunk and you wanna tan his hide.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Want to kill that cyclist on the way to work,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:45.000
and string up your cousin 'cause she's such a jerk. Oh, dear.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
And as for outsiders, white, black or brown,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
tar and feather them, and whip them out of town.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
It's that little gene. It's small and it's mean.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Too small for detection, it's your built-in protection.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Adrenaline, kill. It'll give you the will.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Yes, you'd better face it 'cause you can't displace it.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
You're V-I-O-L-E-N-T.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Cause you're either a victim, or on top, like me.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Goodbye, Abraham Lincoln.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Goodbye, Mahatma Gandhi.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Goodbye, Martin Luther King.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Hello, gangs from this neighborhood

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
killing gangs from that neighborhood.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Hello governments of rich countries

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
selling arms to governments of poor countries

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
who can't even afford to give them food.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Hello civilization. Hello, 21st century.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Look what we've ...

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:14.000
look what they've done.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.000
(Applause)

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Mainstream art, cinema,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
has been used across the world to talk about social issues.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
A few years ago we had a film called Rang De Basanti,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
which suddenly spawned thousands of young people

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
wanting to volunteer for social change.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
In Venezuela, one of the most popular

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
soap operas has a heroine called Crystal.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
And when, onscreen, Crystal got breast cancer,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:50.000
75,000 more young women went to have mammographies done.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
And of course, "The Vagina Monologues" we know about.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
And there are stand-up comics

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
who are talking about racial issues, about ethnic issues.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
So, why is it,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
that if we think that we all agree

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
that we need a better world,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
we need a more just world,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
why is it that we are not using the one language

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
that has consistently showed us

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
that we can break down barriers, that we can reach people?

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
What I need to say to the planners of the world,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
the governments, the strategists

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
is, "You have treated the arts as the cherry on the cake.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
It needs to be the yeast."

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Because, any future planning,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
if 2048 is when we want to get there,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
unless the arts are put with the scientists,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
with the economists,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
with all those who prepare for the future, badly,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
we're not going to get there.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
And unless this is actually internalized, it won't happen.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
So, what is it that we require? What is it that we need?

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
We need to break down our vision

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
of what planners are,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
of what the correct way of a path is.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
And to say all these years of trying

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
to make a better world, and we have failed.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
There are more people being raped. There are more wars.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
There are more people dying of simple things.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
So, something has got to give. And that is what I want.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Can I have my last audio track please?

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Once there was a princess who whistled beautifully.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
(Whistling)

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Her father the king said, "Don't whistle."

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Her mother the queen said, "Hai, don't whistle."

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
But the princess continued whistling.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
(Whistling)

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
The years went by and the princess grew up

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
into a beautiful young woman,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
who whistled even more beautifully.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000
(Whistling)

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Her father the king said, "Who will marry a whistling princess?"

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Her mother the queen said, "Who will marry a whistling princess?"

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
But the king had an idea.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
He announced a Swayamvara.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
He invited all the princes to come and defeat his daughter at whistling.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
"Whoever defeats my daughter shall have half my kingdom

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
and her hand in marriage!"

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Soon the palace filled with princes whistling.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
(Whistling)

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Some whistled badly.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Some whistled well.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
But nobody could defeat the princess.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
"Now what shall we do?" said the king.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
"Now what shall we do?" said the queen.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
But the princess said, "Father, Mother, don't worry.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
I have an idea. I am going to go to each of these young men

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
and I am going to ask them

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
if they defeated correctly.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
And if somebody answers, that shall be my wish."

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
So she went up to each and said, "Do you accept that I have defeated you?"

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
And they said, "Me? Defeated by a woman?

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
No way, that's impossible! No no no no no! That's not possible."

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Till finally one prince said,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
"Princess, I accept, you have defeated me."

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
"Uh-huh ..." she said.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
"Father, mother, this man shall be my wife."

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000
(Whistling)

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Thank you.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:31.000
(Applause)
