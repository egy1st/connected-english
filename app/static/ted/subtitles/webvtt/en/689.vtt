00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
As an Indian, and now as a politician

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
and a government minister,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I've become rather concerned about

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
the hype we're hearing about our own country,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
all this talk about India becoming a world leader,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
even the next superpower.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
In fact, the American publishers of my book,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
"The Elephant, The Tiger and the Cell Phone,"

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
added a gratuitous subtitle saying,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
"India: The next 21st-century power."

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And I just don't think that's what India's all about,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
or should be all about.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Indeed, what worries me is the entire notion of world leadership

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
seems to me terribly archaic.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It's redolent of James Bond movies

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and Kipling ballads.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
After all, what constitutes a world leader?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
If it's population, we're on course to top the charts.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
We will overtake China by 2034.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Is it military strength? Well, we have the world's fourth largest army.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Is it nuclear capacity? We know we have that.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The Americans have even recognized it,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
in an agreement.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Is it the economy? Well, we have now

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
the fifth-largest economy in the world

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
in purchasing power parity terms.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And we continue to grow. When the rest of the world took a beating last year,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
we grew at 6.7 percent.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
But, somehow, none of that adds up to me,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
to what I think India really can aim to contribute in the world,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
in this part of the 21st century.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And so I wondered, could

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
what the future beckons for India to be all about

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
be a combination of these things allied to something else,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
the power of example,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
the attraction of India's culture,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
what, in other words, people like to call "soft power."

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Soft power is a concept invented by a Harvard academic,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Joseph Nye, a friend of mine.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And, very simply, and I'm really cutting it short because of the time limits here,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
it's essentially the ability of a country to attract others

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
because of its culture, its political values,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
its foreign policies.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And, you know, lots of countries do this. He was writing initially about the States,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
but we know the Alliance Francaise

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
is all about French soft power, the British Council.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
The Beijing Olympics were an exercise in Chinese soft power.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Americans have the Voice of America and the Fulbright scholarships.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
But, the fact is, in fact,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
that probably Hollywood and MTV and McDonalds

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
have done more for American soft power

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
around the world than any specifically government activity.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So soft power is something that really emerges

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
partly because of governments,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
but partly despite governments.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And in the information era we all live in today,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
what we might call the TED age,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
I'd say that countries are increasingly being judged

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
by a global public that's been fed

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
on an incessant diet of Internet news,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
of televised images,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
of cellphone videos, of email gossip.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
In other words, all sorts of communication devices

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
are telling us the stories of countries,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
whether or not the countries concerned want people to hear those stories.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Now, in this age, again, countries with access

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
to multiple channels of communication

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
and information have a particular advantage.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And of course they have more influence, sometimes, about how they're seen.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
India has more all-news TV channels

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
than any country in the world,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
in fact in most of the countries in this part of the world put together.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
But, the fact still is that it's not just that.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
In order to have soft power, you have to be connected.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
One might argue that India has become

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
an astonishingly connected country.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
I think you've already heard the figures.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
We've been selling 15 million cellphones a month.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Currently there are 509 million cellphones

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
in Indian hands, in India.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And that makes us larger than the U.S. as a telephone market.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
In fact, those 15 million cellphones

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
are the most connections that any country,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
including the U.S. and China,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
has ever established in the history of telecommunications.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
But, what perhaps some of you don't realize

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
is how far we've come to get there.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
You know, when I grew up in India,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
telephones were a rarity.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
In fact, they were so rare that elected members of Parliament

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
had the right to allocate 15 telephone lines

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
as a favor to those they deemed worthy.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
If you were lucky enough to be a wealthy businessman

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
or an influential journalist, or a doctor or something, you might have a telephone.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
But sometimes it just sat there.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
I went to high school in Calcutta.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
And we would look at this instrument sitting in the front foyer.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
But half the time we would pick it up

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
with an expectant look on our faces,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
there would be no dial tone.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
If there was a dial tone and you dialed a number,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
the odds were two in three you wouldn't get the number you were intending to reach.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
In fact the words "wrong number" were more popular than the word "Hello."

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000
(Laughter)

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
If you then wanted to connect to another city,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
let's say from Calcutta you wanted to call Delhi,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
you'd have to book something called a trunk call,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
and then sit by the phone all day, waiting for it to come through.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Or you could pay eight times the going rate

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
for something called a lightning call.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
But, lightning struck rather slowly in our country in those days,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
so, it was like about a half an hour for a lightning call to come through.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
In fact, so woeful was our telephone service

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
that a Member of Parliament stood up in 1984 and complained about this.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And the Then-Communications Minister replied in a lordly manner

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
that in a developing country

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
communications are a luxury, not a right,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
that the government had no obligation to provide better service,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
and if the honorable Member wasn't satisfied with his telephone,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
could he please return it, since there was an eight-year-long waiting list

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
for telephones in India.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Now, fast-forward to today and this is what you see:

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
the 15 million cell phones a month.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
But what is most striking is who is carrying those cell phones.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
You know, if you visit friends in the suburbs of Delhi,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
on the side streets you will find a fellow with a cart

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
that looks like it was designed in the 16th century,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
wielding a coal-fired steam iron

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
that might have been invented in the 18th century.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
He's called an isthri wala. But he's carrying a 21st-century instrument.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
He's carrying a cell phone because most incoming calls are free,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
and that's how he gets orders from the neighborhood,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
to know where to collect clothes to get them ironed.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
The other day I was in Kerala, my home state,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
at the country farm of a friend,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
about 20 kilometers away from any place you'd consider urban.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
And it was a hot day and he said, "Hey, would you like some fresh coconut water?"

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
And it's the best thing and the most nutritious and refreshing thing you can drink

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
on a hot day in the tropics, so I said sure.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
And he whipped out his cellphone, dialed the number,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
and a voice said, "I'm up here."

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
And right on top of the nearest coconut tree,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
with a hatchet in one hand and a cell phone in the other,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
was a local toddy tapper,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
who proceeded to bring down the coconuts for us to drink.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Fishermen are going out to sea and carrying their cell phones.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
When they catch the fish they call all the market towns along the coast

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
to find out where they get the best possible prices.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Farmers now, who used to have to spend half a day of backbreaking labor

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
to find out if the market town was open,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
if the market was on,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
whether the product they'd harvested could be sold, what price they'd fetch.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
They'd often send an eight year old boy all the way on this trudge

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
to the market town to get that information and come back,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
then they'd load the cart.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Today they're saving half a day's labor with a two minute phone call.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
So this empowerment of the underclass

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
is the real result of India being connected.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
And that transformation is part of where India is heading today.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
But, of course that's not the only thing about India that's spreading.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
You've got Bollywood. My attitude to Bollywood is best summarized

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
in the tale of the two goats at a Bollywood garbage dump --

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Mr. Shekhar Kapur, forgive me --

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
and they're chewing away on cans of celluloid discarded by a Bollywood studio.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
And the first goat, chewing away, says, "You know, this film is not bad."

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
And the second goat says, "No, the book was better."

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000
(Laughter)

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
I usually tend to think that the book is usually better,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
but, having said that,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
the fact is that Bollywood is now

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000
taking a certain aspect of Indian-ness and Indian culture around the globe,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
not just in the Indian diaspora in the U.S. and the U.K.,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
but to the screens of Arabs and Africans, of Senegalese and Syrians.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
I've met a young man in New York whose illiterate mother

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
in a village in Senegal

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
takes a bus once a month to the capital city of Dakar,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
just to watch a Bollywood movie.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
She can't understand the dialogue.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
She's illiterate, so she can't read the French subtitles.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
But these movies are made to be understood despite such handicaps,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
and she has a great time in the song and the dance and the action.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
She goes away with stars in her eyes about India, as a result.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
And this is happening more and more.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Afghanistan, we know what a serious security problem

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Afghanistan is for so many of us in the world.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
India doesn't have a military mission there.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
You know what was India's biggest asset in Afghanistan in the last seven years?

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
One simple fact:

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
you couldn't try to call an Afghan at 8:30 in the evening.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Why? Because that was the moment

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
when the Indian television soap opera,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.000
"Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi," dubbed into Dari, was telecast on Tolo T.V.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
And it was the most popular television show in Afghan history.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Every Afghan family wanted to watch it.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
They had to suspend functions at 8:30.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Weddings were reported to be interrupted

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
so guests could cluster around the T.V. set,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
and then turn their attention back to the bride and groom.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Crime went up at 8:30. I have read a Reuters dispatch --

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
so this is not Indian propaganda, a British news agency --

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
about how robbers in the town of Musarri Sharif*

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
stripped a vehicle of its windshield wipers,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
its hubcaps, its sideview mirrors,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
any moving part they could find, at 8:30,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
because the watchmen were busy watching the T.V. rather than minding the store.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
And they scrawled on the windshield in a reference to the show's heroine,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
"Tulsi Zindabad": "Long live Tulsi."

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000
(Laughter)

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
That's soft power. And that is what India is developing

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
through the "E" part of TED:

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
its own entertainment industry.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
The same is true, of course -- we don't have time for too many more examples --

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
but it's true of our music, of our dance,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
of our art, yoga, ayurveda, even Indian cuisine.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
I mean, the proliferation of Indian restaurants

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
since I first went abroad as a student, in the mid '70s,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
and what I see today, you can't go to a mid-size town in Europe or North America

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
and not find an Indian restaurant. It may not be a very good one.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
But, today in Britain, for example,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Indian restaurants in Britain

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
employ more people than the coal mining,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
ship building and iron and steel industries combined.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
So the empire can strike back.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:16.000
(Applause)

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
But, with this increasing awareness of India,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
with you and with I, and so on,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
with tales like Afghanistan,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
comes something vital in the information era,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
the sense that in today's world

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
it's not the side of the bigger army that wins,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
it's the country that tells a better story that prevails.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
And India is, and must remain, in my view, the land of the better story.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Stereotypes are changing. I mean, again, having gone to the U.S.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
as a student in the mid '70s,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
I knew what the image of India was then, if there was an image at all.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Today, people in Silicon Valley and elsewhere

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
speak of the IITs, the Indian Institutes of Technology

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
with the same reverence they used to accord to MIT.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
This can sometimes have unintended consequences. OK.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
I had a friend, a history major like me,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
who was accosted at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
by an anxiously perspiring European saying,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
"You're Indian, you're Indian! Can you help me fix my laptop?"

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
(Laughter)

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
We've gone from the image of India as

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
land of fakirs lying on beds of nails,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
and snake charmers with the Indian rope trick,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
to the image of India as a land of mathematical geniuses,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
computer wizards, software gurus.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
But that too is transforming the Indian story around the world.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
But, there is something more substantive to that.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
The story rests on a fundamental platform

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
of political pluralism.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
It's a civilizational story to begin with.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Because India has been an open society for millennia.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
India gave refuge to the Jews, fleeing the destruction of the first temple

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
by the Babylonians, and said thereafter by the Romans.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
In fact, legend has is that when Doubting Thomas, the Apostle, Saint Thomas,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
landed on the shores of Kerala, my home state,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
somewhere around 52 A.D.,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
he was welcomed on shore by a flute-playing Jewish girl.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
And to this day remains the only Jewish diaspora

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
in the history of the Jewish people, which has never encountered

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
a single incident of anti-semitism.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:19.000
(Applause)

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
That's the Indian story.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Islam came peacefully to the south,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
slightly more differently complicated history in the north.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
But all of these religions have found a place and a welcome home in India.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
You know, we just celebrated, this year, our general elections,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
the biggest exercise in democratic franchise in human history.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
And the next one will be even bigger, because our voting population

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
keeps growing by 20 million a year.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
But, the fact is

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
that the last elections, five years ago,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
gave the world extraordinary phenomenon

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
of an election being won by a woman political leader

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
of Italian origin and Roman Catholic faith, Sonia Gandhi,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
who then made way for a Sikh, Mohan Singh,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
to be sworn in as Prime Minister

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
by a Muslim, President Abdul Kalam,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
in a country 81 percent Hindu.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:13.000
(Applause)

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
This is India, and of course it's all the more striking

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
because it was four years later that we all applauded

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
the U.S., the oldest democracy in the modern world,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
more than 220 years of free and fair elections,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
which took till last year to elect a president or a vice president

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
who wasn't white, male or Christian.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
So, maybe -- oh sorry, he is Christian, I beg your pardon --

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
and he is male, but he isn't white.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
All the others have been all those three.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
(Laughter)

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
All his predecessors have been all those three,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
and that's the point I was trying to make.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000
(Laughter)

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
But, the issue is

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
that when I talked about that example,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.000
it's not just about talking about India, it's not propaganda.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Because ultimately, that electoral outcome

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
had nothing to do with the rest of the world.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
It was essentially India being itself.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
And ultimately, it seems to me,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
that always works better than propaganda.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Governments aren't very good at telling stories.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
But people see a society for what it is,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
and that, it seems to me, is what ultimately

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
will make a difference in today's information era,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
in today's TED age.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
So India now is no longer

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
the nationalism of ethnicity or language or religion,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
because we have every ethnicity known to mankind, practically,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
we've every religion know to mankind,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
with the possible exception of Shintoism,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
though that has some Hindu elements somewhere.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000
We have 23 official languages that are recognized in our Constitution.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
And those of you who cashed your money here

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
might be surprised to see how many scripts there are

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
on the rupee note, spelling out the denominations.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
We've got all of that.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
We don't even have geography uniting us,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
because the natural geography of the subcontinent

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
framed by the mountains and the sea was hacked

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
by the partition with Pakistan in 1947.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
In fact, you can't even take the name of the country for granted,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
because the name "India" comes from the river Indus,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
which flows in Pakistan.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
But, the whole point is that India

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
is the nationalism of an idea.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
It's the idea of an ever-ever-land,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
emerging from an ancient civilization,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
united by a shared history,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
but sustained, above all, by pluralist democracy.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
That is a 21st-century story as well as an ancient one.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
And it's the nationalism of an idea that

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
essentially says you can endure differences of caste, creed,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000
color, culture, cuisine, custom and costume, consonant, for that matter,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
and still rally around a consensus.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
And the consensus is of a very simple principle,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
that in a diverse plural democracy like India

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
you don't really have to agree on everything all the time,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
so long as you agree on the ground rules

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
of how you will disagree.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
The great success story of India,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
a country that so many learned scholars and journalists

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
assumed would disintegrate, in the '50s and '60s,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000
is that it managed to maintain consensus on how to survive without consensus.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Now, that is the India that is emerging into the 21st century.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
And I do want to make the point

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
that if there is anything worth celebrating about India,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
it isn't military muscle, economic power.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
All of that is necessary,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
but we still have huge amounts of problems to overcome.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Somebody said we are super poor, and we are also super power.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
We can't really be both of those.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
We have to overcome our poverty. We have to deal with the

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
hardware of development,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
the ports, the roads, the airports,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
all the infrastructural things we need to do,

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
and the software of development,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
the human capital, the need for the ordinary person in India

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
to be able to have a couple of square meals a day,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
to be able to send his or her children

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
to a decent school,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
and to aspire to work a job

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
that will give them opportunities in their lives

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
that can transform themselves.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000
But, it's all taking place, this great adventure of conquering those challenges,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
those real challenges which none of us can pretend don't exist.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
But, it's all taking place in an open society,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
in a rich and diverse and plural civilization,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
in one that is determined to liberate and fulfill

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
the creative energies of its people.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
That's why India belongs at TED,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
and that's why TED belongs in India.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Thank you very much.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:33.000
(Applause)
