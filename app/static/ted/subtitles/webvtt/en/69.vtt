00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
You know, one of the intense pleasures of travel

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and one of the delights of ethnographic research

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
is the opportunity to live amongst those

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
who have not forgotten the old ways,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
who still feel their past in the wind,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
touch it in stones polished by rain,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
taste it in the bitter leaves of plants.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Just to know that Jaguar shamans still journey beyond the Milky Way,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
or the myths of the Inuit elders still resonate with meaning,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
or that in the Himalaya,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
the Buddhists still pursue the breath of the Dharma,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and that is the idea that the world in which we live

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
does not exist in some absolute sense,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
but is just one model of reality,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
the consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
that our lineage made, albeit successfully, many generations ago.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And of course, we all share the same adaptive imperatives.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
We're all born. We all bring our children into the world.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We go through initiation rites.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
We have to deal with the inexorable separation of death,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
so it shouldn't surprise us that we all sing, we all dance,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
we all have art.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
But what's interesting is the unique cadence of the song,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
the rhythm of the dance in every culture.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And whether it is the Penan in the forests of Borneo,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
or the Voodoo acolytes in Haiti,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
or the warriors in the Kaisut desert of Northern Kenya,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
the Curandero in the mountains of the Andes,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
or a caravanserai in the middle of the Sahara --

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
this is incidentally the fellow that I traveled into the desert with

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
a month ago --

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
or indeed a yak herder in the slopes of Qomolangma,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Everest, the goddess mother of the world.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
All of these peoples teach us that there are other ways of being,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
other ways of thinking,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
other ways of orienting yourself in the Earth.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And this is an idea, if you think about it,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
can only fill you with hope.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Now, together the myriad cultures of the world

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
that envelops the planet,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and is as important to the well-being of the planet

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a biosphere.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And you might think of this cultural web of life

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
as being an ethnosphere,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and you might define the ethnosphere

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams, myths,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
ideas, inspirations, intuitions brought into being

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
The ethnosphere is humanity's great legacy.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
It's the symbol of all that we are

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And just as the biosphere has been severely eroded,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
so too is the ethnosphere

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
-- and, if anything, at a far greater rate.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
No biologists, for example, would dare suggest

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and yet that -- the most apocalyptic scenario

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
in the realm of biological diversity --

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
in the realm of cultural diversity.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And the great indicator of that, of course, is language loss.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
When each of you in this room were born,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
there were 6,000 languages spoken on the planet.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Now, a language is not just a body of vocabulary

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
or a set of grammatical rules.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
A language is a flash of the human spirit.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
It's a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
comes into the material world.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Every language is an old-growth forest of the mind,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
a watershed, a thought, an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And of those 6,000 languages, as we sit here today in Monterey,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
They're no longer being taught to babies,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
which means, effectively, unless something changes,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000
they're already dead.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
What could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
to be the last of your people to speak your language,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
or anticipate the promise of the children?

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
And yet, that dreadful fate is indeed the plight of somebody

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
somewhere on Earth roughly every two weeks,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
because every two weeks, some elder dies

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and carries with him into the grave the last syllables

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
of an ancient tongue.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And I know there's some of you who say, "Well, wouldn't it be better,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000
wouldn't the world be a better place

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
if we all just spoke one language?" And I say, "Great,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
let's make that language Yoruba. Let's make it Cantonese.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Let's make it Kogi."

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And you'll suddenly discover what it would be like

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
to be unable to speak your own language.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And so, what I'd like to do with you today

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
is sort of take you on a journey through the ethnosphere,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
a brief journey through the ethnosphere,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Now, there are many of us who sort of forget

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
that when I say "different ways of being,"

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
I really do mean different ways of being.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Take, for example, this child of a Barasana in the Northwest Amazon,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000
the people of the anaconda

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
who believe that mythologically they came up the milk river

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
from the east in the belly of sacred snakes.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Now, this is a people who cognitively

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
do not distinguish the color blue from the color green

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
because the canopy of the heavens

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000
is equated to the canopy of the forest

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
upon which the people depend.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
They have a curious language and marriage rule

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
which is called "linguistic exogamy:"

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
you must marry someone who speaks a different language.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
And this is all rooted in the mythological past,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
yet the curious thing is in these long houses,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
where there are six or seven languages spoken

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
because of intermarriage,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
you never hear anyone practicing a language.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
They simply listen and then begin to speak.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Or, one of the most fascinating tribes I ever lived with,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
the Waorani of northeastern Ecuador,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
an astonishing people first contacted peacefully in 1958.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
In 1957, five missionaries attempted contact

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000
and made a critical mistake.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000
They dropped from the air

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
8 x 10 glossy photographs of themselves

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
in what we would say to be friendly gestures,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
forgetting that these people of the rainforest

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
had never seen anything two-dimensional in their lives.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
They picked up these photographs from the forest floor,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
found nothing, and concluded that these were calling cards

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
from the devil, so they speared the five missionaries to death.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
But the Waorani didn't just spear outsiders.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000
They speared each other.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
54 percent of their mortality was due to them spearing each other.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
We traced genealogies back eight generations,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
and we found two instances of natural death

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
and when we pressured the people a little bit about it,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
that he died getting old, so we speared him anyway. (Laughter)

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
But at the same time they had a perspicacious knowledge

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000
of the forest that was astonishing.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Their hunters could smell animal urine at 40 paces

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
and tell you what species left it behind.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
In the early '80s, I had a really astonishing assignment

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
when I was asked by my professor at Harvard

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
if I was interested in going down to Haiti,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
infiltrating the secret societies

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
which were the foundation of Duvalier's strength

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000
and Tonton Macoutes,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and securing the poison used to make zombies.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
In order to make sense out of sensation, of course,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
I had to understand something about this remarkable faith

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
of Vodoun. And Voodoo is not a black magic cult.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
On the contrary, it's a complex metaphysical worldview.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000
It's interesting.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000
If I asked you to name the great religions of the world,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000
what would you say?

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, whatever.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
There's always one continent left out,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
the assumption being that sub-Saharan Africa

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
had no religious beliefs. Well, of course, they did

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
and Voodoo is simply the distillation

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000
of these very profound religious ideas

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
that came over during the tragic Diaspora of the slavery era.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
But, what makes Voodoo so interesting

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
is that it's this living relationship

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000
between the living and the dead.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000
So, the living give birth to the spirits.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
The spirits can be invoked from beneath the Great Water,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
responding to the rhythm of the dance

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
to momentarily displace the soul of the living,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
so that for that brief shining moment, the acolyte becomes the god.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
That's why the Voodooists like to say

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
that "You white people go to church and speak about God.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
We dance in the temple and become God."

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
And because you are possessed, you are taken by the spirit --

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000
how can you be harmed?

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
So you see these astonishing demonstrations:

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Voodoo acolytes in a state of trance

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
handling burning embers with impunity,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
a rather astonishing demonstration of the ability of the mind

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000
to affect the body that bears it

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
when catalyzed in the state of extreme excitation.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Now, of all the peoples that I've ever been with,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
the most extraordinary are the Kogi

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northern Colombia.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
which once carpeted the Caribbean coastal plain of Colombia,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000
in the wake of the conquest,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
these people retreated into an isolated volcanic massif

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
that soars above the Caribbean coastal plain.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
In a bloodstained continent,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
these people alone were never conquered by the Spanish.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
To this day, they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
but the training for the priesthood is rather extraordinary.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
The young acolytes are taken away from their families

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
at the age of three and four,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
in stone huts at the base of glaciers for 18 years:

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000
two nine-year periods

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of gestation

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
they spend in their natural mother's womb;

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
now they are metaphorically in the womb of the great mother.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000
And for this entire time,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
they are inculturated into the values of their society,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
values that maintain the proposition that their prayers

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic --

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
or we might say the ecological -- balance.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And at the end of this amazing initiation,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
one day they're suddenly taken out

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
and for the first time in their lives, at the age of 18,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
they see a sunrise. And in that crystal moment of awareness

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
of first light as the Sun begins to bathe the slopes

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000
of the stunningly beautiful landscape,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
is affirmed in stunning glory. And the priest steps back

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
and says, "You see? It's really as I've told you.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
It is that beautiful. It is yours to protect."

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
They call themselves the "elder brothers"

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
and they say we, who are the younger brothers,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
are the ones responsible for destroying the world.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Now, this level of intuition becomes very important.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Whenever we think of indigenous people and landscape,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
we either invoke Rousseau

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
and the old canard of the "noble savage,"

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
which is an idea racist in its simplicity,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
or alternatively, we invoke Thoreau

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
and say these people are closer to the Earth than we are.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Well, indigenous people are neither sentimental

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
nor weakened by nostalgia.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
There's not a lot of room for either

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
in the malarial swamps of the Asmat

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
or in the chilling winds of Tibet, but they have, nevertheless,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.000
through time and ritual, forged a traditional mystique of the Earth

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
that is based not on the idea of being self-consciously close to it,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
but on a far subtler intuition:

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
the idea that the Earth itself can only exist

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
because it is breathed into being by human consciousness.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Now, what does that mean?

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
It means that a young kid from the Andes

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
who's raised to believe that that mountain is an Apu spirit

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
that will direct his or her destiny

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
will be a profoundly different human being

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
and have a different relationship to that resource

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
or that place than a young kid from Montana

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000
ready to be mined.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Whether it's the abode of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
What's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
between the individual and the natural world.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
I was raised in the forests of British Columbia

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
to believe those forests existed to be cut.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
That made me a different human being

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
than my friends amongst the Kwagiulth

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
who believe that those forests were the abode of Huxwhukw

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000
and the Crooked Beak of Heaven

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
and the cannibal spirits that dwelled at the north end of the world,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
spirits they would have to engage during their Hamatsa initiation.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Now, if you begin to look at the idea

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
that these cultures could create different realities,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000
you could begin to understand

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
some of their extraordinary discoveries. Take this plant here.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
It's a photograph I took in the Northwest Amazon just last April.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
This is ayahuasca, which many of you have heard about,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
the most powerful psychoactive preparation

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
of the shaman's repertoire.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
What makes ayahuasca fascinating

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
is not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
but the elaboration of it. It's made really of two different sources:

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
on the one hand, this woody liana

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
which has in it a series of beta-carbolines,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
harmine, harmaline, mildly hallucinogenic --

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
to take the vine alone

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
is rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
drift across your consciousness --

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
but it's mixed with the leaves of a shrub in the coffee family

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
called Psychotria viridis.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
This plant had in it some very powerful tryptamines,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
very close to brain serotonin, dimethyltryptamine,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000
5-methoxydimethyltryptamine.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
If you've ever seen the Yanomami

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
blowing that snuff up their noses,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
that substance they make from a different set of species

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
also contains methoxydimethyltryptamine.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
To have that powder blown up your nose

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
is rather like being shot out of a rifle barrel

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:21.000
lined with baroque paintings and landing on a sea of electricity. (Laughter)

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
It doesn't create the distortion of reality;

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000
it creates the dissolution of reality.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
In fact, I used to argue with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes --

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
who is a man who sparked the psychedelic era

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
with his discovery of the magic mushrooms

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
in Mexico in the 1930s --

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
I used to argue that you couldn't classify these tryptamines

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
as hallucinogenic because by the time you're under the effects

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
there's no one home anymore to experience a hallucination. (Laughter)

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
But the thing about tryptamines is they cannot be taken orally

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
because they're denatured by an enzyme

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
found naturally in the human gut called monoamine oxidase.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
They can only be taken orally if taken in conjunction

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
with some other chemical that denatures the MAO.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Now, the fascinating things

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
are that the beta-carbolines found within that liana

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
are MAO inhibitors of the precise sort necessary

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
to potentiate the tryptamine. So you ask yourself a question.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
How, in a flora of 80,000 species of vascular plants,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
do these people find these two morphologically unrelated plants

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000
that when combined in this way,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
created a kind of biochemical version

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts?

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Well, we use that great euphemism, "trial and error,"

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000
which is exposed to be meaningless.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
But you ask the Indians, and they say, "The plants talk to us."

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Well, what does that mean?

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
This tribe, the Cofan, has 17 varieties of ayahuasca,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
all of which are referable to our eye as one species.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
And then you ask them how they establish their taxonomy

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
and they say, "I thought you knew something about plants.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
I mean, don't you know anything?" And I said, "No."

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Well, it turns out you take each of the 17 varieties

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
in the night of a full moon, and it sings to you in a different key.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Now, that's not going to get you a Ph.D. at Harvard,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
but it's a lot more interesting than counting stamens. (Laughter)

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Now --

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
(Applause) --

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
the problem -- the problem is that even those of us

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
sympathetic with the plight of indigenous people

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000
view them as quaint and colorful

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
but somehow reduced to the margins of history

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
as the real world, meaning our world, moves on.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Well, the truth is the 20th century, 300 years from now,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
is not going to be remembered for its wars

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000
or its technological innovations,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
but rather as the era in which we stood by

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
and either actively endorsed or passively accepted

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
on the planet. Now, the problem isn't change.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
All cultures through all time

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
have constantly been engaged in a dance

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000
with new possibilities of life.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
And the problem is not technology itself.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
The Sioux Indians did not stop being Sioux

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000
when they gave up the bow and arrow

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
any more than an American stopped being an American

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
when he gave up the horse and buggy.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000
It's not change or technology

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
that threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere. It is power,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
the crude face of domination.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Wherever you look around the world,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away;

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
these are dynamic living peoples

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
being driven out of existence by identifiable forces

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
that are beyond their capacity to adapt to:

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
whether it's the egregious deforestation

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
in the homeland of the Penan --

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
a nomadic people from Southeast Asia, from Sarawak --

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
and now have all been reduced to servitude and prostitution

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
on the banks of the rivers,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
where you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
that seems to be carrying half of Borneo away

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000
to the South China Sea,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
where the Japanese freighters hang light in the horizon

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
ready to fill their holds with raw logs ripped from the forest --

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
or, in the case of the Yanomami,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
it's the disease entities that have come in,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
in the wake of the discovery of gold.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Or if we go into the mountains of Tibet,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
where I'm doing a lot of research recently,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
you'll see it's a crude face of political domination.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
You know, genocide, the physical extinction of a people

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
is universally condemned, but ethnocide,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
the destruction of people's way of life, is not only not condemned,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
it's universally, in many quarters, celebrated

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
as part of a development strategy.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
And you cannot understand the pain of Tibet

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
until you move through it at the ground level.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
I once travelled 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Western China

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
overland through southeastern Tibet to Lhasa

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
with a young colleague, and it was only when I got to Lhasa

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
that I understood the face behind the statistics

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000
you hear about:

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
6,000 sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
1.2 million people killed by the cadres

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000
during the Cultural Revolution.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
This young man's father had been ascribed to the Panchen Lama.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
That meant he was instantly killed

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
at the time of the Chinese invasion.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
His uncle fled with His Holiness in the Diaspora

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
that took the people to Nepal.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
His mother was incarcerated

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
for the crime of being wealthy.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
He was smuggled into the jail at the age of two

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
to hide beneath her skirt tails

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
because she couldn't bear to be without him.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
The sister who had done that brave deed

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000
was put into an education camp.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
One day she inadvertently stepped on an armband

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
of Mao, and for that transgression,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
she was given seven years of hard labor.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
The pain of Tibet can be impossible to bear,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
but the redemptive spirit of the people is something to behold.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
And in the end, then, it really comes down to a choice:

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotony

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
or do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity?

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Margaret Mead, the great anthropologist, said, before she died,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
that her greatest fear was that as we drifted towards

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
this blandly amorphous generic world view

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000
not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
reduced to a more narrow modality of thought,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000
but that we would wake from a dream one day

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
having forgotten there were even other possibilities.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
And it's humbling to remember that our species has, perhaps,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
been around for [150,000] years.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
The Neolithic Revolution -- which gave us agriculture,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
at which time we succumbed to the cult of the seed;

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
the poetry of the shaman was displaced

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.000
by the prose of the priesthood;

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
we created hierarchy specialization surplus --

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
is only 10,000 years ago.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
The modern industrial world as we know it

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
is barely 300 years old.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Now, that shallow history doesn't suggest to me

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
that we have all the answers for all of the challenges

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
that will confront us in the ensuing millennia.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
When these myriad cultures of the world

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
are asked the meaning of being human,

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
they respond with 10,000 different voices.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:26.000
And it's within that song that we will all rediscover the possibility

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
of being what we are: a fully conscious species,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
fully aware of ensuring that all peoples and all gardens

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:38.000
find a way to flourish. And there are great moments of optimism.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
This is a photograph I took at the northern tip of Baffin Island

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
when I went narwhal hunting with some Inuit people,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
and this man, Olayuk, told me a marvelous story of his grandfather.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
The Canadian government has not always been kind

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
to the Inuit people, and during the 1950s,

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
to establish our sovereignty, we forced them into settlements.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
This old man's grandfather refused to go.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
The family, fearful for his life, took away all of his weapons,

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000
all of his tools.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Now, you must understand that the Inuit did not fear the cold;

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000
they took advantage of it.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
The runners of their sleds were originally made of fish

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000
wrapped in caribou hide.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000
So, this man's grandfather was not intimidated by the Arctic night

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
or the blizzard that was blowing.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
He simply slipped outside, pulled down his sealskin trousers

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000
and defecated into his hand. And as the feces began to freeze,

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000
he shaped it into the form of a blade.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
He put a spray of saliva on the edge of the shit knife

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
and as it finally froze solid, he butchered a dog with it.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
He skinned the dog and improvised a harness,

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
took the ribcage of the dog and improvised a sled,

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000
harnessed up an adjacent dog,

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
and disappeared over the ice floes, shit knife in belt.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000
Talk about getting by with nothing. (Laughter)

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000
And this, in many ways --

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
(Applause) --

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
is a symbol of the resilience of the Inuit people

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
and of all indigenous people around the world.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
The Canadian government in April of 1999

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000
gave back to total control of the Inuit

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000
an area of land larger than California and Texas put together.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
It's our new homeland. It's called Nunavut.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
It's an independent territory. They control all mineral resources.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
An amazing example of how a nation-state

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000
can seek restitution with its people.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
And finally, in the end, I think it's pretty obvious

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000
at least to all of all us who've traveled

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
in these remote reaches of the planet,

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000
to realize that they're not remote at all.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
They're homelands of somebody.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
They represent branches of the human imagination

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
that go back to the dawn of time. And for all of us,

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000
the dreams of these children, like the dreams of our own children,

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
become part of the naked geography of hope.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000
So, what we're trying to do at the National Geographic, finally,

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000
is, we believe that politicians will never accomplish anything.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000
We think that polemics --

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
(Applause) --

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
we think that polemics are not persuasive,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000
but we think that storytelling can change the world,

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000
and so we are probably the best storytelling institution

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000
in the world. We get 35 million hits on our website every month.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000
156 nations carry our television channel.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
Our magazines are read by millions.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000
And what we're doing is a series of journeys

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
to the ethnosphere where we're going to take our audience

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
to places of such cultural wonder

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
that they cannot help but come away dazzled

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
by what they have seen, and hopefully, therefore,

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
embrace gradually, one by one,

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
the central revelation of anthropology:

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000
that this world deserves to exist in a diverse way,

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.000
that we can find a way to live

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000
in a truly multicultural, pluralistic world

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
where all of the wisdom of all peoples

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000
can contribute to our collective well-being.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000
Thank you very much.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
(Applause)
