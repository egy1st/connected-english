00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
One morning, in the year 1957,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
the neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
saw himself like this,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
a weird freak with huge hands,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
huge mouth,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and a tiny bottom.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Actually this creature

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
is the result of the Penfield research.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
He named it homunculus.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Basically the homunculus is

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
the visualization of a human being

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
where each part of the body is proportional

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
to the surface it takes in the brain.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So, of course, homunculus is definitely not a freak.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
It's you. It's me.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
It's our invisible reality.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
This visualization could explain, for example,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
why newborns, or smokers,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
put, instinctively, their fingers in the mouth.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Unfortunately it doesn't explain why

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
so many designers remain mainly interested

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
in designing chairs.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So anyway, even if I do not understand science entirely,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
for my design I essentially refer to it.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I'm fascinated by its ability to

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
deeply investigate the human being,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
its way of working, its way of feeling.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And it really helps me to understand

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
how we see, how we hear,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
how we breathe, how our brain can inform or mislead us.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
It's a great tool for me

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
to understand what could be our real needs.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Marketing people have never been able to do that.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Marketing reduces things. Marketing simplifies.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Marketing creates user groups.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And scientists, amidst complexity,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
amidst fluctuation and uniqueness.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
What could be our real needs?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Maybe the silence.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
In our daily life we are continuously disturbed by

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
aggressive sounds.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And you know all those kind of sound puts us

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
in a kind of stressful state,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and prevent us from being quiet and focused.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
So I wanted to create a kind of

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
sound filter,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
able to preserve ourselves from noise pollution.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
But I didn't want it to make it by

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
isolating people, without any earmuffs

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
or those kind of things.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Or neither with including complex technology.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I just wanted to, using the complexity

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and the technology of the brain, of the human brain.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
So I worked with white noise.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
dB is basically --

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
dB is the name of the product,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
basically a white noise diffuser.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000
This is white noise.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
The white noise is the sum of all frequencies

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
that are audible by the human being,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
brought to the same intensity.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And this noise is like a "shhhhhhhhhhhhh," like that.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And this noise is the most neutral.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
It is the perfect sound for our ears and our brain.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
So when you hear this sound

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
you feel like a kind of shelter,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
preserved from noise pollution.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And when you hear the white noise, your brain is immediately focused on it.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
And do not be disturbed any more by the other aggressive sound.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
It seems to be magic.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
But it is just physiology. It's just in your brain.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And in mine, I hope.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
So in order to make this white noise

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
a little bit active and reactive,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
I create a ball, a rolling ball

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
able to analyze and find

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
where does aggressive sound come from,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
and roll, at home or at work,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
towards aggressive noise,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
and emits white noise in order to neutralize it.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
(Laughter)

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
It works.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
You feel the effect of the white noise?

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
It's too in silence.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
If you make some noise you can feel the effect.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
So even if this object,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
even if this product includes some technology,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
it includes some speakers, it includes some microphones

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
and some electronic devices,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
this object is not a very smart object.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
And I don't want to make a very smart object.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
I don't want to create a perfect object like a perfect robot.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
I want to create an object like you and me.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
So, definitely not perfect.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
So imagine, for instance, you are at home.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
A loving dispute with your girl or boyfriend.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
You shout. You say, "Blah blah blah, Blah blah blah. Who is this guy?"

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
And dB will probably roll toward you.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
And turning around you is "shhhhhhh," like that.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000
(Laughter)

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Definitely not perfect. So you would probably

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
shut it, at this point.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
(Laughter)

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Anyway, in this same kind of approach,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
I designed K.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
K is a daylight receiver transmitter.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
So this object is supposed to be displayed on your desk,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
or on your piano, where you are supposed

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
to spend most of your time in the day.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And this object will be

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
able to know exactly the quantity of light you receive during the day,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
and able to give you the quantity of light you need.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
This object is completely covered by

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
fiber opticals.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And the idea of those fiber opticals is to inform the object, for sure,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
but creates the idea of an

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
eye sensibility of the object.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
I want, by this design

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
feel, when you see it,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
you see, instinctively,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
this object seems to be very sensitive,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
very reactive.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
And this object knows, better than you

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
and probably before you, what you really need.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
You have to know that the lack of daylight

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
can provoke some

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
problem of energy, or problem of libido.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
So, a huge problem.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000
(Laughter)

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Most of the projects I work on --

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
I live in collaboration with scientists.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
I'm just a designer. So I need them.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
So there can be some biologists,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
psychiatrists, mathematicians, and so on.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
And I submit them, my intuitions,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
my hypothesis, my first ideas.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
And they react. They told me what is possible, what is impossible.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
And together we improve the original concept.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
And we build the project to the end.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
And this kind of relationship between designer and scientist

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
started when I was at school.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Indeed in my studies I was a guinea pig

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
for a pharmaceutical industry.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
And the irony for me was

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
of course, I didn't do that for the sake of science progress.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
I just do that to make money.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Anyway, this project, or this experience,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
make me start a new project on the design of medicine.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
You have to know that today, roughly one or two every drug pills

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
is not taken correctly.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
So even if the active constituents

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
in pharmaceuticals made constant progress

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
in terms of chemistry, target of stability,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
the behavior of the patients

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
goes more and more unstable.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
So we took too many of them.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
We took irregular dosage.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
We do not follow instructions. And so on.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
So I wanted to create a

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
new kind of medicine,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
in order to create a new kind of relationship

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
between the patient and the treatment.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
So I turned traditional pills into this.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
I'm going to give you some example.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
This one is an antibiotic.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And its purpose is to help patient

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
to go to the end of the treatment.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
And the concept is to

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
create a kind of onion,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
a kind of structure in layers.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
So, you start with the darkest one.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
And you are helped to visualize the duration of the treatment.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
And you are helped to visualize the decrease of the infection.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
So the first day, this is the big one.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
And you have to peel and eat one layer a day.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
And your antibiotic goes smaller and clearer.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
And you're waiting for recovery as you were waiting for the Christmas day.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
And you follow the treatment like that,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
to the end of the treatment.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
And here you can get the white core.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And it means, right, you are in the recovery.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
(Applause) Thank you.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
This one is a "third lung,"

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
a pharmaceutical device for long-term asthma treatment.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
I designed it to help kids to follow the treatment.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
So the idea of this one is to create

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
a relationship between the patient of the treatment

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
but a relationship of dependency.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
But in this case it is not the medication that is dependent on the patient.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
This is, the kids will feel

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
the therapeutic object needs him.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
So the idea is, all night long

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
the elastic skin of the third lung

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
will slowly inflate itself,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
including air and molecules, for sure.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
And when the kids wake up,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
he can see the object needs him. And he take him to his mouth,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
and breathe the air it contains.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
So by this way,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
the kid, to take care of himself,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
is to take care of this living object.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
And he does not feel anymore it's relies on asthma treatment,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
as the asthma treatment needs him.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
(Applause)

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
In this guise of living object approach,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
I like the idea of a kind of invisible design,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
as if the function of the object

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
exists in a kind of invisible field

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
just around the objects themselves.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
We could talk about a kind of soul,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
of a ghost accompanying them.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
And almost a kind of poltergeist effect.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
So when a passive object like this one seems to be alive,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
because it is -- woosh -- starting to move.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
And I remember an exhibition design

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
I made for John Maeda,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
and for the Fondation Cartier in Paris.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
And John Maeda was supposed to show

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
several graphic animations in this exhibition.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
And my idea for this exhibition design was to create

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
a real pong game, like this one.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
And the idea was to create some self-moving benches

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
in the main exhibition room.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
So the living benches would be exactly like the ball.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
And John was so excited by this idea. He said to me, "Okay let's go."

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
I remember the day of the opening.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
I was a little bit late.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000
When I bring the 10 living and self-moving benches

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
in the exhibition room, John was just beside me,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
and was like, "Hmm. Hmm."

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
And he told me, after a long silence,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
"I wonder, Mathieu, if

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
people won't be more fascinated by your benches

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
than by my videos."

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
(Laughter)

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
It would be a great honor, a great compliment for me,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
if he hadn't decided to take all them off

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
two hours before the opening.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
So, huge tragedy.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
I guess you won't be surprised if I tell you

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
that Pinocchio is one of my great influences.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Pinocchio is probably one of my best design products, my favorite one.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Because it is a kind of object with a conscience,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
able to be modified by its surroundings,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
and able to modify it as well.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
The other great influence is the mine's canary.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
In coal mines, this canary

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
was supposed to be close to the miners.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
And it was singing all day long. And when it stops it means that it just died.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
So this canary was a living alarm,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
and a very efficient one.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
A very natural technology,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
in order to say to the miners,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
"The air is too bad. You have to go. It's an emergency."

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
So it's, for me, a great product.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And I tried to design a kind of canary.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Andrea is one.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Andrea is a living air filter that absorbs toxic gasses

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
from air, contaminated indoor air.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
So it uses some plants to do this job,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000
selected for their gas-filtering ability.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
You have to know, or you probably already know,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
that indoor air pollution is more toxic than outdoor one.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
So while I'm talking to you,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
the seats you are sitting on are currently emitting some

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
invisible and odorless toxic gas. Sorry for that. (Laughter)

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
So you are currently breathing formaldehyde.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
It's the same for me with the carpet.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
And this is exactly the same at home.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Because all the product we get constantly give away

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
the volatile component of which they're made of.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
So let's have a look at your home.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
So your sofa, your plastic chair,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
your kid's toys

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
give their own invisible reality. And this one is very toxic.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
This is the reason why

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
I created, with David Edward,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
a scientist of Harvard University,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:41.000
an object able to absorb the toxic elements using those kind of plants.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
But the idea is to force

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
the air to go in the effective part of the plants.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Because the roots of the plant are not very effective.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Bill Wolverton from NASA

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
analyzed it cleverly in the '70s.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
So the idea is to create an object

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
able to force the air, and to be in contact at the right speed

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
at the right place, in all the effective parts of the plant.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
So this is the final object.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
It will be launched next September.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
(Applause)

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
This one is kind of the same approach

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
because I include, in a product

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
like Andrea, some plants.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
And in this one, plants are used for the water filtration ability.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
And it includes some fishes as well.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
But here, unlike Andrea,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
here are supposed to be eaten.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Indeed, this object is a domestic farm,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
for fishes and green.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
So the idea of this object

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
is to be able to get at home

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
very local food.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
The locavores

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
used to get food

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
taken in a radius of 100 miles.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Local River is able to provide you

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
food directly in your living room.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
So the principle of this object

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
is to create an ecosystem

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
called aquaponics.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
And the aquaponics is the dirty water of the fish,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
by a water pump, feeds the plants above.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
And the plants will filter, by the roots,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
the dirty water of the fish.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
After, it goes back into the fish tank.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
After that you have two options.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Or you sit down in front of it like you would do in front your TV set.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Amazing channel.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Or you start fishing.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
And you make some sushis with a fish

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
and the aromatic plants above.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Because you can grow some potatoes.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
No, not potatoes, but tomatoes,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
aromatic plants and so on.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
So now we can breathe safely.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Now we can eat local food.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Now we can be treated by smart medicine.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Now we can be well-balanced in our biorhythm

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
with daylight.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
But it was important to create a perfect place,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
so I tried to,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
in order to work and create.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
So I designed, for an American scientist based in Paris,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
a very stimulative, brain-stimulative office.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
I wanted to create a perfect place

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
where you can work and play,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
and where your body and your brain can work together.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
So, in this office,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
you do not work anymore at your desk, like a politician.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
Your seat, your sleep and your play

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000
on a big geodesic island made of leather.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
See, like this one?

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
In this office you do not work and write and draw on a sheet of paper,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000
but you draw directly on a kind of huge whiteboard cave,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
like a prehistoric scientist.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
So you, like that, can make some sport during your work.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
In this office

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
you do not need to go out

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
in order to be in contact with nature.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
You include, directly, the nature in the floor of the office.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
You can see it there.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
This is an inspiration image

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
to lead this project of the office.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
It really helped me to design it.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
I never show it to my client. He would be so afraid.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000
(Laughter)

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Just for my workshop.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
I guess it may be the revenge of the guinea pig I was.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
But it's maybe the conviction

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
as monkey and homunculus we are.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:36.000
All of us need to be considered according to our real nature.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Thank you very much.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:43.000
(Applause)
