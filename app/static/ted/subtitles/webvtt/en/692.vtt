WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm going to talk

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
about some of my discoveries

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
around the world through my work.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
These are not discoveries of planets

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
or new technologies

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
or science.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
They're discoveries of people

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and the way people are, and new leadership.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
This is Benki.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Benki is a leader of the Ashaninka Nation.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
His people live in Brazil

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and in Peru.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Benki comes from a village

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
so remote up in the Amazon

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
that to get there, either you have to fly

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and land on water,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
or go by canoe for several days.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I met Benki three years ago in Sao Paulo

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
when I'd brought him and other leaders

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
from indigenous peoples

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
to meet with me and leaders from around the world,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
because we wanted to learn from each other.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
We wanted to share our stories with each other.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The Ashaninka people

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
are known throughout South America

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
for their dignity, their spirit

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and their resistance,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
starting with the Incas

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and continuing through the 19th century

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
with the rubber tappers.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Today's biggest threat to the Ashaninka people

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and to Benki

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
comes from illegal logging --

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
the people who come into the beautiful forest

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and cut down ancient mahogany trees,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
float them down the river to world markets.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Benki knew this.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
He could see what was happening to his forest, to his environment,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
because he was taken under his grandfather's wing

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
when he was only two years old

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
to begin to learn about the forest

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and the way of life of his people.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
His grandfather died when he was only 10.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And at that young age, 10 years old,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Benki became the paje of his community.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Now, in the Ashaninka tradition and culture,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
the paje is the most important

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
person in the community.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
This is the person who contains within him

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
all the knowledge, all the wisdom

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
of centuries and centuries of life,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and not just about his people,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
but about everything that his people's survival depended on:

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
the trees, the birds,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
the water, the soil, the forest.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
So when he was only 10 and he became the paje,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
he began to lead his people.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
He began to talk to them

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
about the forest that they needed to protect,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
the way of life they needed to nurture.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
He explained to them

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
that it was not a question of survival of the fittest;

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
it was a question of understanding

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
what they needed to survive

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and to protect that.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Eight years later,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
when he was a young man of 18,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Benki left the forest for the first time.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
He went 3,000 miles on an odyssey to Rio

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
to the Earth Summit

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
to tell the world what was happening

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
in his tiny, little corner.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And he went because he hoped the world would listen.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Some did, not everybody.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
But if you can imagine this young man

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
with his headdress and his flowing robe,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
learning a new language, Portuguese,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
not to mention English,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
going to Rio,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
building a bridge

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
to reach out to people he'd never met before --

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
a pretty hostile world.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
But he wasn't dismayed.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Benki came back to his village full of ideas --

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
new technologies, new research,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
new ways of understanding what was going on.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Since that time,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
he's continued to work with his people,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
and not only the Ashaninka Nation,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
but all the peoples of the Amazon and beyond.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
He's built schools

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
to teach children to care for the forest.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Together, he's led the reforestation

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
of over 25 percent of the land

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
that had been destroyed by the loggers.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
He's created a cooperative

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
to help people diversify their livelihoods.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
And he's brought the internet and satellite technology

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
to the forest --

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
both so that people themselves

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
could monitor the deforestation,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
but also that he could speak from the forest

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
to the rest of the world.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
If you were to meet Benki

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
and ask him, "Why are you doing this?

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Why are you putting yourself at risk?

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Why are you making yourself vulnerable

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
to what is often a hostile world?"

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
he would tell you,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
as he told me,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
"I asked myself," he said,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
"What did my grandparents and my great-grandparents do

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
to protect the forest for me?

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And what am I doing?"

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
So when I think of that,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
I wonder what our grandchildren

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
and our great-grandchildren,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
when they ask themselves that question,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
I wonder how they will answer.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
For me, the world is veering

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
towards a future we don't much want

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
when we really think about it deep inside.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
It's a future we don't know the details of,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
but it's a future that has signs,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
just like Benki saw the signs around him.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
We know we are running out of what we need.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
We're running out of fresh water.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
We're running out of fossil fuels.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
We're running out of land.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
We know climate change is going to affect all of us.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
We don't know how, but we know it will.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And we know that there will be more of us than ever before --

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
five times as many people in 40 years

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
than 60 years ago.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
We are running out of what we need.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And we also know

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
that the world has changed in other ways,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
that since 1960

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
there are one-third as many new countries

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
that exist as independent entities on the planet.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Egos, systems of government --

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
figuring it out --

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
massive change.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
And in addition to that,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
we know that five other really big countries

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
are going to have a say in the future,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
a say we haven't even really started to hear yet --

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
China, India,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Russia, South Africa

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
and Benki's own Brazil,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
where Benki got his civil rights

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
only in the 1988 constitution.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
But you know all that.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
You know more than Benki knew when he left his forest

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
and went 3,000 miles.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
You also know

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
that we can't just keep doing what we've always done,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
because we'll get the results

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
we've always gotten.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And this reminds me of something I understand

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Lord Salisbury said to Queen Victoria over a hundred years ago,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
when she was pressing him, "Please change."

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
He said, "Change?

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Why change?

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Things are bad enough as they are."

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
We have to change.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
It's imperative to me, when I look around the world,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
that we need to change ourselves.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
We need new models of what it means to be a leader.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
We need new models

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
of being a leader and a human in the world.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
I started life as a banker.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Now I don't admit to that

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
to anybody but my very close friends.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
But for the past eight years,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
I've done something completely different.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
My work has taken me around the world,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
where I've had the real privilege

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
of meeting people like Benki

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
and many others who are making change happen

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
in their communities --

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
people who see the world differently,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
who are asking different questions,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
who have different answers,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
who understand the filters that they wear

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
when they go out into the world.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
This is Sanghamitra.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Sanghamitra comes from Bangalore.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
I met Sanghamitra eight years ago

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
when I was in Bangalore

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
organizing a workshop with leaders of different NGO's

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
working in some of the hardest aspects of society.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Sanghamitra didn't start life

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
as a leader of an NGO,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
she started her career as university professor,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
teaching English literature.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
But she realized that she was much too detached from the world doing that.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
She loved it, but she was too detached.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
And so in 1993,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
a long time ago,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
she decided to start a new organization

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
called Samraksha

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
focused on one of the hardest areas,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
one of the hardest issues in India --

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
anywhere in the world at the time --

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
HIV/AIDS.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Since that time, Samraksha has grown

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
from strength to strength

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
and is now one of the leading health NGO's in India.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
But if you just think about the state of the world

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
and knowledge of HIV/AIDS

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
in 1993 --

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
in India at that time it was skyrocketing

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
and nobody understood why,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
and everyone was actually very, very afraid.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Today there are still three million

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
HIV-positive people in India.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
That's the second largest population in the world.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
When I asked Sanghamitra,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
"How did you get from English literature

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
to HIV/AIDS?"

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
not an obvious path,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
she said to me,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
"It's all connected.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Literature makes one sensitive,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
sensitive to people,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
to their dreams and to their ideas."

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Since that time, under her leadership,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Samraksha has been a pioneer

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
in all fields related

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
to HIV/AIDS.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
They have respite homes, the first,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
the first care centers,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
the first counseling services --

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
and not just in urban, 7-million-population Bangalore,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
but in the hardest to reach villages

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
in the state of Karnataka.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Even that wasn't enough.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
She wanted to change policy at the government level.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
10 of their programs that she pioneered

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
are now government policy and funded by the government.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
They take care of 20,000-odd people today

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
in over 1,000 villages around Karnataka.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
She works with people like Murali Krishna.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Murali Krishna comes from one of those villages.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
He lost his wife to AIDS a couple of years ago,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
and he's HIV-positive.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
But he saw the work, the care,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
the compassion

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
that Sanghamitra and her team brought to the village,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
and he wanted to be part of it.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
He's a Leaders' Quest fellow, and that helps him with his work.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
They've pioneered a different approach to villages.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Instead of handing out information in pamphlets,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
as is so often the case,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
they bring theater troupes,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
songs, music, dance.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
And they sit around,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
and they talk about dreams.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Sanghamitra told me just last week --

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
she had just come back from two weeks in the villages,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
and she had a real breakthrough.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
They were sitting in a circle, talking about the dreams for the village.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
And the young women in the village

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
spoke up and said, "We've changed our dream.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Our dream

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
is for our partners, our husbands,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
not to be given to us because of a horoscope,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
but to be given to us

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
because they've been tested for HIV."

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
If you are lucky enough to meet Sanghamitra

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
and ask her why and how,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
how have you achieved so much?

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
She would look at you

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
and very quietly, very softly say,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
"It just happened.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
It's the spirit inside."

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
This is Dr. Fan Jianchuan.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Jianchuan comes from Sichuan Province

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
in southwest China.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
He was born in 1957,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
and you can imagine what his childhood

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
looked like and felt like,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
and what his life has been like

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
over the last 50 tumultuous years.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
He's been a soldier, a teacher,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
a politician, a vice-mayor

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
and a business man.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
But if you sat down and asked him, "Who are you really,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
and what do you do?"

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
He would tell you, "I'm a collector,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
and I curate a museum."

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
I was lucky; I had heard about him for years,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
and I finally met him earlier this year

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
at his museum in Chengdu.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
He's been a collector all of his life,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
starting when he was four or five in the early 1960's.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Now, just think of the early 1960's in China.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Over a lifetime, through everything,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
through the Cultural Revolution and everything afterward,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
he's kept collecting,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
so that he now has over eight million pieces

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
in his museums

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
documenting contemporary Chinese history.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
These are pieces that you won't find anywhere else in the world,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
in part because they document parts of history

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Chinese choose to forget.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
For example, he's got over one million pieces

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
documenting the Sino-Japanese War,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
a war that's not talked about in China very much

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
and whose heroes are not honored.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Why did he do all this?

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Because he thought

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
a nation should never repeat the mistakes of the past.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
So, from commissioning

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
slightly larger than life bronze statues

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
of the heroes of the Sino-Japanese War,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
including those Chinese

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
who then fought with each other

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
and left mainland China to go to Taiwan,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
to commemorating all the unknown,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
ordinary soldiers who survived,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
by asking them to take prints of their hands,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
he is making sure -- one man is making sure --

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
that history is not forgotten.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
But it's not just Chinese heroes he cares about.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
This building contains the world's largest collection

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
of documents and artifacts

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
commemorating the U.S. role

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
in fighting on the Chinese side

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
in that long war --

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
the Flying Tigers.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
He has nine other buildings --

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
that are already open to the public --

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
filled to the rafters with artifacts

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
documenting contemporary Chinese history.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Two of the most sensitive buildings

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
include a lifetime of collection

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
about the Cultural Revolution,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
a period that actually most Chinese

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
would prefer to forget.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
But he doesn't want his nation

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
ever to forget.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
These people inspire me,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
and they inspire me because they show us

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
what is possible when you change the way

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
you look at the world,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
change the way you look at your place in the world.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
They looked outside,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
and then they changed what was on the inside.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
They didn't go to business school.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
They didn't read a manual, "How to Be a Good Leader

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
in 10 Easy Steps."

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
But they have qualities we'd all recognize.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
They have drive, passion, commitment.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
They've gone away

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
from what they did before,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
and they've gone

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
to something they didn't know.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
They've tried to connect worlds

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
they didn't know existed before.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
They've built bridges, and they've walked across them.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
They have a sense of the great arc of time

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
and their tiny place in it.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
They know people have come before them

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
and will follow them.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
And they know that they're part of a whole,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
that they depend on other people.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
It's not about them, they know that,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
but it has to start with them.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
And they have humility.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
It just happens.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
But we know it doesn't just happen, don't we?

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
We know it takes a lot to make it happen,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
and we know the direction the world is going in.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
So I think we need succession planning

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
on a global basis.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
We can't wait for the next generation, the new joiners,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
to come in and learn how to be the good leaders we need.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
I think it has to start with us.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
And we know, just like they knew,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
how hard it is.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
But the good news is that we don't have to figure it out as we go along;

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
we have models, we have examples,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
like Benki and Sanghamitra and Jianchuan.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
We can look at what they've done, if we look.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
We can learn from what they've learned.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
We can change the way we see ourselves in the world.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
And if we're lucky,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
we can change the way

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
our great-grandchildren

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
will answer Benki's question.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
Thank you.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
(Applause)
