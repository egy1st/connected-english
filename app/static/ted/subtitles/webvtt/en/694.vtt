00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
As technology progresses,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and as it advances,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
many of us assume that these advances

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
make us more intelligent,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
make us smarter and more connected to the world.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And what I'd like to argue

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
is that that's not necessarily the case,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
as progress is simply a word for change,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and with change you gain something,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
but you also lose something.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And to really illustrate this point, what I'd like to do

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
is to show you how technology has dealt with

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
a very simple, a very common, an everyday question.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And that question is this.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
What time is it? What time is it?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
If you glance at your iPhone, it's so simple to tell the time.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
But, I'd like to ask you, how would you tell the time

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
if you didn't have an iPhone?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
How would you tell the time, say, 600 years ago?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
How would you do it?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Well, the way you would do it is by using a device

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
that's called an astrolabe.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So, an astrolabe is relatively unknown in today's world.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
But, at the time, in the 13th century,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
it was the gadget of the day.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
It was the world's first popular computer.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And it was a device that, in fact, is a model of the sky.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So, the different parts of the astrolabe, in this particular type,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
the rete corresponds to the positions of the stars.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
The plate corresponds to a coordinate system.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And the mater has some scales and puts it all together.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
If you were an educated child,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
you would know how to not only use the astrolabe,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
you would also know how to make an astrolabe.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And we know this because the first treatise on the astrolabe,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
the first technical manual in the English language,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
was written by Geoffrey Chaucer.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Yes, that Geoffrey Chaucer, in 1391,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
to his little Lewis, his 11-year-old son.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And in this book, little Lewis would know the big idea.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And the central idea that makes this computer work

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
is this thing called stereographic projection.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And basically, the concept is,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
how do you represent the three-dimensional image

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
of the night sky that surrounds us

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
onto a flat, portable, two-dimensional surface.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
The idea is actually relatively simple.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Imagine that that Earth is at the center of the universe,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and surrounding it is the sky projected onto a sphere.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Each point on the surface of the sphere

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
is mapped through the bottom pole,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
onto a flat surface, where it is then recorded.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
So the North Star corresponds to the center of the device.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
The ecliptic, which is the path of the sun, moon, and planets

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
correspond to an offset circle.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
The bright stars correspond to little daggers on the rete.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And the altitude corresponds to the plate system.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Now, the real genius of the astrolabe is not just the projection.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
The real genius is that it brings together two coordinate systems

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
so they fit perfectly.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
There is the position of the sun, moon and planets on the movable rete.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And then there is their location on the sky

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
as seen from a certain latitude on the back plate. Okay?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
So how would you use this device?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Well, let me first back up for a moment.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
This is an astrolabe. Pretty impressive, isn't it?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And so, this astrolabe is on loan from us

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
from the Oxford School of -- Museum of History.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And you can see the different components.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
This is the mater, the scales on the back.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
This is the rete. Okay. Do you see that?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
That's the movable part of the sky.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And in the back you can see

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
a spider web pattern.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And that spider web pattern corresponds to the local coordinates in the sky.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
This is a rule device. And on the back

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
are some other devices, measuring tools

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and scales, to be able to make some calculations. Okay?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
You know, I've always wanted one of these.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
For my thesis I actually built one of these out of paper.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And this one, this is a replica

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
from a 15th-century device.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
And it's worth probably about three MacBook Pros.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
But a real one would cost about as much as my house,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
and the house next to it, and actually every house on the block,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
on both sides of the street,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
maybe a school thrown in, and some -- you know, a church.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
They are just incredibly expensive.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
But let me show you how to work this device.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
So let's go to step one.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
First thing that you do is you select a star

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
in the night sky, if you're telling time at night.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
So, tonight, if it's clear you'll be able to see the summer triangle.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
And there is a bright star called Deneb. So let's select Deneb.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Second, is you measure the altitude of Deneb.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
So, step two, I hold the device up,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
and then I sight its altitude there

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
so I can see it clearly now.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
And then I measure its altitude.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
So, it's about 26 degrees. You can't see it from over there.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Step three is identify the star on the front of the device.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Deneb is there. I can tell.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Step four is I then move the rete,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
move the sky, so the altitude of the star

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
corresponds to the scale on the back.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Okay, so when that happens

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
everything lines up.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
I have here a model of the sky

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
that corresponds to the real sky. Okay?

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
So, it is, in a sense,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
holding a model of the universe in my hands.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
And then finally, I take a rule,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
and move the rule to a date line

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
which then tells me the time here.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Right. So, that's how the device is used.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000
(Laughter)

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
So, I know what you're thinking:

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
"That's a lot of work, isn't it? Isn't it a ton of work to be able to tell the time?"

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
as you glance at your iPod to just check out the time.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
But there is a difference between the two, because with your iPod

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
you can tell -- or your iPhone, you can tell exactly

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
what the time is, with precision.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
The way little Lewis would tell the time

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
is by a picture of the sky.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
He would know where things would fit in the sky.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
He would not only know what time it was,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
he would also know where the sun would rise,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
and how it would move across the sky.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
He would know what time the sun would rise, and what time it would set.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
And he would know that for essentially every celestial object

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
in the heavens.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
So, in computer graphics

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
and computer user interface design,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
there is a term called affordances.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
So, affordances are the qualities of an object

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
that allow us to perform an action with it.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
And what the astrolabe does is it allows us,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
it affords us, to connect to the night sky,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
to look up into the night sky and be much more --

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
to see the visible and the invisible together.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
So, that's just one use. Incredible,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
there is probably 350, 400 uses.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
In fact, there is a text, and that has over a thousand uses

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
of this first computer.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
On the back there is scales and measurements

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
for terrestrial navigation.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
You can survey with it. The city of Baghdad was surveyed with it.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
It can be used for calculating mathematical equations of all different types.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
And it would take a full university course to illustrate it.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Astrolabes have an incredible history.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
They are over 2,000 years old.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
The concept of stereographic projection

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
originated in 330 B.C.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
And the astrolabes come in many different

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
sizes and shapes and forms.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
There is portable ones. There is large display ones.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
And I think what is common to all astrolabes

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
is that they are beautiful works of art.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
There is a quality of craftsmanship and precision

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
that is just astonishing and remarkable.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Astrolabes, like every technology, do evolve over time.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
So, the earliest retes, for example, were very simple and primitive.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
And advancing retes became cultural emblems.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
This is one from Oxford.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
And I find this one really extraordinary because the rete pattern

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
is completely symmetrical,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
and it accurately maps a completely asymmetrical, or random sky.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
How cool is that? This is just amazing.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
So, would little Lewis have an astrolabe?

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Probably not one made of brass. He would have one made out of wood,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
or paper. And the vast majority of this first computer

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
was a portable device

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
that you could keep in the back of your pocket.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
So, what does the astrolabe inspire?

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Well, I think the first thing is that

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
it reminds us just how resourceful people were,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
our forebears were, years and years ago.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
It's just an incredible device.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Every technology advances.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Every technology is transformed and moved by others.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And what we gain with a new technology, of course,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
is precision and accuracy.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
But what we lose, I think, is

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
an accurate -- a felt sense

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
of the sky, a sense of context.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Knowing the sky, knowing your relationship with the sky,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
is the center of the real answer

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
to knowing what time it is.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
So, it's -- I think astrolabes are just remarkable devices.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
And so, what can you learn from these devices?

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Well, primarily that there is a subtle knowledge

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
that we can connect with the world.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
And astrolabes return us to this subtle sense

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
of how things all fit together,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
and also how we connect to the world.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Thanks very much.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
(Applause)
