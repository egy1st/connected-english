00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Once upon a time,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
at the age of 24,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I was a student at St. John's Medical College in Bangalore.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I was a guest student during one month

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
of a public health course.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And that changed my mindset forever.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The course was good, but it was not the course content

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
in itself that changed the mindset.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
It was the brutal realization,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
the first morning,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
that the Indian students were better than me.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
(Laughter)

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
You see, I was a study nerd.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I loved statistics from a young age.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And I studied very much in Sweden.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I used to be in the upper quarter of all courses I attended.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
But in St. John's, I was in the lower quarter.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And the fact was that Indian students

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
studied harder than we did in Sweden.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
They read the textbook twice,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
or three times or four times.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
In Sweden we read it once and then we went partying.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
(Laugher)

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And that, to me,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
that personal experience

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
was the first time in my life

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
that the mindset I grew up with

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
was changed.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And I realized that perhaps

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
the Western world will not continue

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
to dominate the world forever.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And I think many of you have the same sort of personal experience.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
It's that realization of someone you meet

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
that really made you change your ideas about the world.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
It's not the statistics, although I tried to make it funny.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And I will now,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
here, onstage,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
try to predict when that will happen --

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
that Asia will regain

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
its dominant position

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
as the leading part of the world,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
as it used to be, over thousands of years.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And I will do that

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
by trying to predict precisely

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
at what year

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
the average income per person

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
in India, in China, will reach that of the West.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And I don't mean the whole economy,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
because to grow an economy

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
of India to the size of U.K. --

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
that's a piece of cake, with one billion people.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
But I want to see when will the average pay, the money

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
for each person, per month,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
in India and China,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
when will that have reached that of U.K. and the United States?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
But I will start with a historical background.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And you can see my map if I get it up here. You know?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I will start at 1858.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
1858 was a year of great technological

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
advancement in the West.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
That was the year when Queen Victoria

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
was able, for the first time, to communicate

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
with President Buchanan,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
through the Transatlantic Telegraphic Cable.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And they were the first to "Twitter" transatlantically.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000
(Laughter)

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
(Applause)

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And I've been able, through this wonderful Google and Internet,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
to find the text of the telegram

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
sent back from President Buchanan to Queen Victoria.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And it ends like this: "This telegraph

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
is a fantastic instrument to diffuse religion,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
civilization, liberty and law throughout the world."

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Those are nice words. But I got sort of curious

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
of what he meant with liberty, and liberty for whom.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And we will think about that

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
when we look at the wider picture of the world in 1858.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Because 1858

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
was also watershed year

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
in the history of Asia.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
1858 was the year

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
when the courageous uprising

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
against the foreign occupation of India

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
was defeated by the British forces.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And India was up to 89 years more of foreign domination.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
1858 in China

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
was the victory in the Opium War by the British forces.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And that meant that foreigners, as it said in the treaty,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
were allowed to trade freely in China.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
It meant paying with opium for Chinese goods.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And 1858 in Japan

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
was the year when Japan had to sign the Harris Treaty

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
and accept trade on favorable condition for the U.S.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And they were threatened by those black ships there,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
that had been in Tokyo harbor over the last year.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
But, Japan, in contrast to India and China,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
maintained its national sovereignty.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And let's see how much difference that can make.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And I will do that by bringing these bubbles

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
back to a Gapminder graph here,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
where you can see each bubble is a country.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
The size of the bubble here is the population.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
On this axis, as I used to have income per person in comparable dollar.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
And on that axis I have life expectancy, the health of people.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And I also bring an innovation here.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
I have transformed the laser beam

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000
into an ecological, recyclable version here, in green India.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
(Applause)

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
And we will see, you know.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Look here, 1858, India was here,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
China was here, Japan was there,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
United States and United Kingdom

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
was richer over there.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
And I will start the world like this.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
India was not always like this level.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Actually if we go back into the historical record,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
there was a time hundreds of years ago

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
when the income per person in India and China

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
was even above that of Europe.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
But 1850 had already been many, many years of foreign domination,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
and India had been de-industrialized.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And you can see that the countries who were growing

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
their economy was United States and United Kingdom.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
And they were also, by the end of the century, getting healthy,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
and Japan was starting to catch up.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
India was trying down here.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Can you see how it starts to move there?

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
But really, really natural sovereignty was good for Japan.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And Japan is trying to move up there.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And it's the new century now. Health is getting better,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
United Kingdom, United States.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
But careful now -- we are approaching the First World War.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
And the First World War, you know,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
we'll see a lot of deaths and economical problems here.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
United Kingdom is going down.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And now comes the Spanish flu also.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
And then after the First World War, they continue up.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Still under foreign domination, and without sovereignty,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
India and China are down in the corner.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Not much has happened.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
They have grown their population but not much more.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
In the 1930's now, you can see

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
that Japan is going to a period of war,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
with lower life expectancy.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
And the Second World War was really a terrible event,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
also economically for Japan.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
But they did recover quite fast afterwards.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
And we are moving into the new world.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
In 1947 India finally

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
gained its independence.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And they could raise the Indian flag and become a sovereign nation,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
but in very big difficulties down there.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
(Applause)

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
In 1949 we saw the emergence of the modern China

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
in a way which surprised the world.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And what happened?

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
What happens in the after independence?

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
You can see that the health started to improve.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Children started to go to school.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Health services were provided.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
This is the Great Leap Forward, when China fell down.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
It was central planning by Mao Tse Tung.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
China recovered. Then they said,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
"Nevermore, stupid central planning."

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
But they went up here, and India was trying to follow.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
And they were catching up indeed.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
And both countries had the better health, but still

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
a very low economy.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
And we came to 1978, and Mao Tse Tung died,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
and a new guy turned up from the left.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And it was Deng Xiaoping coming out here.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
And he said, "Doesn't matter

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
if a cat is white or black,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
as long as it catches mice."

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Because catching mice

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
is what the two cats wanted to do.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And you can see the two cats being here,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
China and India, wanting to catch the mices over there, you know.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
And they decided to go not only for health and education,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
but also starting to grow their economy.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And the market reformer was successful there.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
In '92 India follows with a market reform.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
And they go quite closely together,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
and you can see that the similarity with India and China,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
in many ways, are greater than the differences with them.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
And here they march on. And will they catch up?

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
This is the big question today.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
There they are today.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Now what does it mean that the --

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
(Applause)

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
the averages there -- this is the average of China.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
If I would split China, look here,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Shanghai has already catched up.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Shanghai is already there.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And it's healthier than the United States.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
But on the other hand, Guizhou, one of the poorest

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
inland provinces of China, is there.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
And if I split Guizhou into urban and rural,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
the rural part of Guizhou goes down there.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
You see this enormous inequity in China,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
in the midst of fast economic growth.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
And if I would also look at India,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
you have another type of inequity, actually, in India.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:08.000
The geographical, macro-geographical difference is not so big.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Uttar Pradesh, the biggest of the states here,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
is poorer and has a lower health than the rest of India.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Kerala is flying on top there,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
matching United States in health,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
but not in economy.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
And here, Maharashtra, with Mumbai,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
is forging forward.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Now in India, the big inequities are within the state,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
rather than between the states.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And that is not a bad thing, in itself.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
If you have a lot inequity, macro-geographical inequities

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
can be more difficult in the long term to deal with,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
than if it is in the same area where you have a growth center

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
relatively close to where poor people are living.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
No, there is one more inequity. Look there, United States.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000
(Laughter)

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Oh, they broke my frame.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Washington, D.C. went out here.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
My friends at Gapminder wanted me to show this

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
because there is a new leader in Washington

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
who is really concerned about the health system.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
And I can understand him, because Washington, D.C.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
is so rich over there

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
but they are not as healthy as Kerala.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
It's quite interesting, isn't it?

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
(Applause)

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
I can see a business opportunity for Kerala,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
helping fix the health system in the United States.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
(Laughter)

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
(Applause)

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Now here we have the whole world. You have the legend down there.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
And when you see the two giant cats here, pushing forward,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
you see that in between them

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
and ahead of them,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
is the whole emerging economies of the world,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
which Thomas Friedman so correctly called the "flat world."

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
You can see that in health and education,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
a large part of the world population is putting forward,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
but in Africa, and other parts,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
as in rural Guizhou in China,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
there is still people with low health and very low economy.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
We have an enormous disparity in the world.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
But most of the world in the middle are pushing forwards very fast.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Now, back to my projections.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000
When will it catch up? I have to go back to very conventional graph.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
I will show income per person on this axis instead,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
poor down here, rich up there.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
And then time here, from 1858

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
I start the world.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And we shall see what will happen with these countries.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
You see, China under foreign domination

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
actually lowered their income and came down to the Indian level here.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Whereas U.K. and United States is getting richer and richer.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
And after Second World War, United States is richer than U.K.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
But independence is coming here.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Growth is starting, economic reform.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Growth is faster, and with projection from IMF

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
you can see where you expect them to be in 2014.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Now, the question is, "When will the catch up take place?"

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Look at, look at the United States.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Can you see the bubble?

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
The bubbles, not my bubbles,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
but the financial bubbles.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000
That's the dot com bubble. This is the Lehman Brothers doorstep there.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
You see it came down there.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000
And it seems this is another rock coming down there, you know.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
So they doesn't seem to go this way, these countries.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
They seem to go in a more humble growth way, you know.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
And people interested in growth

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
are turning their eyes towards Asia.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
I can compare to Japan. This is Japan coming up.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
You see, Japan did it like that.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
We add Japan to it.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
And there is no doubt that fast catch up

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
can take place.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Can you see here what Japan did?

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Japan did it like this, until full catch up,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
and then they follow with the other high-income economies.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
But the real projections for those ones,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
I would like to give it like this.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Can be worse, can be better.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
It's always difficult to predict, especially about the future.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Now, a historian tells me it's even more difficult to predict about the past.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
(Laughter)

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
I think I'm in a difficult position here.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Inequalities in China and India

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
I consider really the big obstacle

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
because to bring the entire population into growth and prosperity

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
is what will create a domestic market,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
what will avoid social instability,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
and which will make use of the entire capacity

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
of the population.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
So, social investments in health, education and infrastructure,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:32.000
and electricity is really what is needed in India and China.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
You know the climate. We have great international experts

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
within India telling us that the climate is changing,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
and actions has to be taken,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
otherwise China and India would be the countries

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
most to suffer from climate change.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
And I consider India and China the best partners in the world

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
in a good global climate policy.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
But they ain't going to pay

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
for what others, who have more money,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
have largely created, and I can agree on that.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
But what I'm really worried about is war.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Will the former rich countries really accept

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
a completely changed world economy,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
and a shift of power away from where it has been

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
the last 50 to 100 to 150 years,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
back to Asia?

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
And will Asia be able to handle that

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
new position of being in charge

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
of being the most mighty, and the governors of the world?

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
So, always avoid war,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
because that always pushes human beings backward.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Now if these inequalities, climate and war can be avoided,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
get ready for a world in equity,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
because this is what seems to be happening.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
And that vision that I got as a young student,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:43.000
1972, that Indians can be much better than Swedes,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
is just about to happen.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
And it will happen precisely

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
the year 2048

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
in the later part of the summer, in July,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
more precisely, the 27th of July.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:06.000
(Applause)

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
The 27th of July, 2048

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
is my 100th birthday.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
(Laughter)

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
And I expect to speak

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
in the first session of the 39th TED India.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Get your bookings in time. Thank you very much.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:30.000
(Applause)
