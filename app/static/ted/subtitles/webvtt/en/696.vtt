00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
As a culture, we tell ourselves lots of stories

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
about the future,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and where we might move forward from this point.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Some of those stories are that

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
somebody is just going to sort everything out for us.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Other stories are that everything is on the verge of unraveling.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
But I want to tell you a different story here today.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Like all stories, it has a beginning.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
My work, for a long time, has been involved in education,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
in teaching people practical skills

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
for sustainability,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
teaching people how to take responsibility

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
for growing some of their own food,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
how to build buildings using local materials,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
how to generate their own energy, and so on.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I lived in Ireland, built the first straw-bale houses in Ireland,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and some cob buildings and all this kind of thing.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
But all my work for many years was focused

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
around the idea that sustainability

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
means basically looking at

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
the globalized economic growth model,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and moderating what comes in at one end,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and moderating the outputs at the other end.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And then I came into contact with a way of looking at things

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
which actually changed that profoundly.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And in order to introduce you to that,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I've got something here that I'm going to unveil,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
which is one of the great marvels of the modern age.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And it's something so astounding and so astonishing

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
that I think maybe as I remove this cloth

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
a suitable gasp of amazement might be appropriate.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
If you could help me with that it would be fantastic.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
(Laughter)

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
This is a liter of oil.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
This bottle of oil,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
distilled over a hundred million years of geological time,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
ancient sunlight,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
contains the energy equivalent of about five weeks

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
hard human manual labor --

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
equivalent to about 35 strong people

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
coming round and working for you.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
We can turn it into a dazzling array of materials,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
medicine, modern clothing,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
laptops, a whole range of different things.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
It gives us an energy return that's unimaginable, historically.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
We've based the design of our settlements,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
our business models, our transport plans,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
even the idea of economic growth, some would argue,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
on the assumption that we will have this in perpetuity.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Yet, when we take a step back,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
and look over the span of history,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
at what we might call the petroleum interval,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
it's a short period in history

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
where we've discovered this extraordinary material,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and then based a whole way of life around it.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
But as we straddle the top of this energy mountain, at this stage,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
we move from a time where our economic success,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
our sense of individual prowess and well-being

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
is directly linked to how much of this we consume,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
to a time when actually our degree of oil dependency

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
is our degree of vulnerability.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And it's increasingly clear that we

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
aren't going to be able to rely on the fact that

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
we're going to have this at our disposal forever.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
For every four barrels of oil that we consume,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
we only discover one.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And that gap continues to widen.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
There is also the fact that the amount of energy

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
that we get back from the oil that we discover is falling.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
In the 1930s we got 100 units of energy back

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
for every one that we put in to extract it.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Completely unprecedented, historically.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Already that's fallen to about 11.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And that's why, now,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
the new breakthroughs, the new frontiers

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
in terms of oil extraction are scrambling about in Alberta,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
or at the bottom of the oceans.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
There are 98 oil-producing nations in the world.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
But of those, 65 have already passed their peak.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
The moment when the world on average passes this peak,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
people wonder when that's going to happen.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000
And there is an emerging case

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
that maybe that was what happened last July

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
when the oil prices were so high.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
But are we to assume that the same brilliance

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
and creativity and adaptability

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
that got us up to the top of that energy mountain in the first place

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
is somehow mysteriously going to evaporate

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
when we have to design a creative way back down the other side?

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
No. But the thinking that we have to come up with

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
has to be based on a realistic assessment

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
of where we are.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
There is also the issue of climate change,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
is the other thing that underpins this transition approach.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
But the thing that I notice, as I talk to climate scientists,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
is the increasingly terrified look they have in their eyes,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
as the data that's coming in,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
which is far ahead of what the IPCC are talking about.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
So the IPCC said

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
that we might see significant breakup

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
of the arctic ice in 2100, in their worst case scenario.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Actually, if current trends continue,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
it could all be gone in five or 10 years' time.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
If just three percent of the carbon locked up in the arctic permafrost

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
is released as the world warms,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
it would offset all the savings that we need to make,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
in carbon, over the next 40 years to avoid runaway climate change.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
We have no choice other than deep and urgent decarbonization.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
But I'm always very interested to think about

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
what might the stories be

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
that the generations further down the slope from us

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
are going to tell about us.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
"The generation that lived at the top of the mountain,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
that partied so hard, and so abused its inheritance."

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
And one of the ways I like to do that

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
is to look back at the stories people used to tell

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
before we had cheap oil, before we had fossil fuels,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
and people relied on their own muscle, animal muscle energy,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
or a little bit of wind, little bit of water energy.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
We had stories like "The Seven-League Boots":

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
the giant who had these boots, where, once you put them on,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
with every stride you could cover seven leagues, or 21 miles,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
a kind of travel completely unimaginable

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
to people without that kind of energy at their disposal.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Stories like The Magic Porridge Pot,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
where you had a pot where if you knew the magic words,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
this pot would just make as much food as you liked,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
without you having to do any work,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
provided you could remember the other magic word to stop it making porridge.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Otherwise you'd flood your entire town with warm porridge.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
There is the story of "The Elves and the Shoemaker."

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
The people who make shoes go to sleep, wake up in the morning,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
and all the shoes are magically made for them.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
It's something that was unimaginable to people then.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Now we have the seven-league boots

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
in the form of Ryanair and Easyjet.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
We have the magic porridge pot

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
in the form of Walmart and Tesco.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
And we have the elves in the form of China.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
But we don't appreciate what an astonishing

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
thing that has been.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
And what are the stories that we tell ourselves now,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
as we look forward about where we're going to go.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
And I would argue that there are four. There is the idea of business as usual,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
that the future will be like the present, just more of it.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
But as we've seen over the last year, I think that's an idea

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
that is increasingly coming into question.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And in terms of climate change,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
is something that is not actually feasible.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
There is the idea of hitting the wall,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
that actually somehow everything is so fragile

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
that it might just all unravel and collapse.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
This is a popular story in some places.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
The third story is the idea that technology can solve everything,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
that technology can somehow get us through this completely.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
And it's an idea that I think is very prevalent at these TED Talks,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
the idea that we can invent our way out of a profound

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
economic and energy crisis,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
that a move to a knowledge economy

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
can somehow neatly sidestep those energy constraints,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
the idea that we'll discover some fabulous new source of energy

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
that will mean we can sweep all concerns

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
about energy security to one side,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
the idea that we can step off neatly

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
onto a completely renewable world.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
But the world isn't Second Life.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
We can't create new land and new energy systems at the click of a mouse.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
And as we sit, exchanging free ideas with each other,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
there are still people mining coal

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
in order to power the servers, extracting the minerals

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
to make all of those things.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
The breakfast that we eat as we sit down

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
to check our email in the morning

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
is still transported at great distances,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
usually at the expense of the local, more resilient

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
food systems that would have supplied that in the past,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
which we've so effectively devalued and dismantled.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
We can be astonishingly inventive and creative.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
But we also live in a world with very real constraints and demands.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Energy and technology are not the same thing.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
What I'm involved with is the transition response.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
And this is really about looking the challenges

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
of peak oil and climate change square in the face,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
and responding with a creativity and an adaptability

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
and an imagination that we really need.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
It's something which has spread incredibly fast.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And it is something which has several characteristics.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
It's viral. It seems to spread under the radar very, very quickly.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
It's open source. It's something which everybody who's involved with it

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
develops and passes on as they work with it.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
It's self-organizing. There is no great central organization

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
that pushes this; people just pick up an idea

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
and they run with it, and they implement it where they are.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
It's solutions-focused. It's very much looking at what people can do

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
where they are, to respond to this.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
It's sensitive to place and to scale.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Transitional is completely different.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Transition groups in Chile, transition groups in the U.S., transition groups here,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
what they're doing looks very different in every place that you go to.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
It learns very much from its mistakes.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
And it feels historic. It tries to create a sense

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
that this is a historic opportunity

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
to do something really extraordinary.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
And it's a process which is really joyful.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
People have a huge amount of fun doing this,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
reconnecting with other people as they do it.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
One of the things that underpins it is this idea of resilience.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
And I think, in many ways, the idea of resilience

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
is a more useful concept than the idea of sustainability.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
The idea of resilience comes from the study of ecology.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
And it's really about how systems,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
settlements, withstand shock from the outside.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
When they encounter shock from the outside

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
that they don't just unravel and fall to pieces.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
And I think it's a more useful concept than sustainability, as I said.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
When our supermarkets have only two or three days' worth of food in them

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
at any one time, often sustainability tends to focus on

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
the energy efficiency of the freezers

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
and on the packaging that the lettuces are wrapped up in.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Looking through the lens of resilience,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
we really question how we've let ourselves get into a situation

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
that's so vulnerable.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Resilience runs much deeper:

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
it's about building modularity into what we do,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
building surge breakers into how we organize the basic things that support us.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
This is a photograph of the Bristol and District

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Market Gardeners Association, in 1897.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
This is at a time when the city of Bristol,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
which is quite close to here,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
was surrounded by commercial market gardens,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
which provided a significant amount of the food

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
that was consumed in the town, and created a lot of employment for people, as well.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
There was a degree of resilience, if you like, at that time,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
which we can now only look back on with envy.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
So how does this transition idea work?

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
So basically, you have a group of people who are excited by the idea.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
They pick up some of the tools that we've developed.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
They start to run an awareness-raising program

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
looking at how this might actually work in the town.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
They show films, they give talks, and so on.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
It's a process which is playful and creative

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
and informative.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Then they start to form working groups, looking at different aspects of this,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
and then from that, there emerge a whole lot of projects

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
which then the transition project itself

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:10.000
starts to support and enable.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
So it started out with some work I was involved in in Ireland,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
where I was teaching, and has since spread.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
There are now over 200 formal transition projects.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
And there are thousands of others who are at what we call the mulling stage.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
They are mulling whether they're going to take it further.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
And actually a lot of them are doing huge amounts of stuff.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
But what do they actually do? You know, it's a kind of nice idea,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
but what do they actually do on the ground?

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Well, I think it's really important to make the point that actually

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
you know, this isn't something which is going to do everything on its own.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
We need international legislation from Copenhagen and so on.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
We need national responses. We need local government responses.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
But all of those things are going to be much easier

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
if we have communities that are vibrant and coming up with ideas

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
and leading from the front, making unelectable policies electable,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
over the next 5 to 10 years.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Some of the things that emerge from it are local food projects,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
like community-supported agriculture schemes,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
urban food production, creating local food directories, and so on.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
A lot of places now are starting to set up their own energy companies,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
community-owned energy companies,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
where the community can invest money into itself,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
to start putting in place

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
the kind of renewable energy infrastructure that we need.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
A lot of places are working with their local schools.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Newent in the Forest of Dean: big polytunnel they built for the school;

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
the kids are learning how to grow food.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Promoting recycling, things like garden-share,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
that matches up people who don't have a garden

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
who would like to grow food, with people who have gardens they aren't using anymore.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Planting productive trees throughout urban spaces.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
And also starting to play around with the idea of

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
alternative currencies.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
This is Lewes in Sussex,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
who have recently launched the Lewes Pound,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
a currency that you can only spend within the town,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
as a way of starting to cycle money within the local economy.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
You take it anywhere else, it's not worth anything.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
But actually within the town you start to create these economic

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
cycles much more effectively.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Another thing that they do is what we call an energy descent plan,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
which is basically to develop a plan B for the town.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Most of our local authorities, when they sit down to plan

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
for the next five, 10, 15, 20 years of a community,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
still start by assuming that there will be more energy,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
more cars, more housing,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
more jobs, more growth, and so on.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
What does it look like if that's not the case? And how can we embrace that

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
and actually come up with something that was actually more likely

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
to sustain everybody?

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
As a friend of mine says, "Life is a series of things you're not quite ready for."

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
And that's certainly been my experience with transition.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
From three years ago, it just being an idea,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000
this has become something that has virally swept around the world.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
We're getting a lot of interest from government. Ed Miliband,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
the energy minister of this country, was invited to come to our recent conference

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
as a keynote listener.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Which he did --

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000
(Laughter)

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
(Applause) --

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
and has since become a great advocate of the whole idea.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
There are now two local authorities in this country

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
who have declared themselves transitional local authorities,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Leicestershire and Somerset. And in Stroud,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000
the transition group there, in effect, wrote the local government's food plan.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
And the head of the council said,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
"If we didn't have Transition Stroud, we would have to invent

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
all of that community infrastructure for the first time."

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
As we see the spread of it, we see national hubs emerging.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
In Scotland, the Scottish government's climate change fund

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
has funded Transition Scotland

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
as a national organization supporting the spread of this.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
And we see it all over the place as well now.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
But the key to transition is thinking not that we have to change everything now,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
but that things are already inevitably changing,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
and what we need to do is to work creatively with that,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
based on asking the right questions.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
I think I'd like to just return at the end

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
to the idea of stories.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Because I think stories are vital here.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
And actually the stories that we tell ourselves,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000
we have a huge dearth of stories about how to move forward creatively from here.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
And one of the key things that transition does

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
is to pull those stories out of what people are doing.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Stories about the community that's produced

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
its own 21 pound note, for example,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
the school that's turned its car park into a food garden,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
the community that's founded its own energy company.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
And for me, one of the great stories recently

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
was the Obamas digging up the south lawn of the White House

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
to create a vegetable garden. Because the last time that was done,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
when Eleanor Roosevelt did it,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000
it led to the creation of 20 million vegetable gardens across the United States.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
So the question I'd like to leave you with, really,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
is -- for all aspects of the things that your community needs

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
in order to thrive,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
how can it be done in such a way

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
that drastically reduces its carbon emissions,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
while also building resilience?

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Personally, I feel enormously grateful

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
to have lived through the age of cheap oil.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
I've been astonishingly lucky, we've been astonishingly lucky.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
But let us honor what it has bought us,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
and move forward from this point.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Because if we cling to it, and continue to assume

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
that it can underpin our choices,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
the future that it presents to us is one which is really unmanageable.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
And by loving and leaving all that oil has done for us,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
and that the Oil Age has done for us,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
we are able to then begin the creation

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
of a world which is more resilient,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
more nourishing,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
and in which, we find ourselves fitter, more skilled

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
and more connected to each other.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Thank you very much.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
(Applause)
