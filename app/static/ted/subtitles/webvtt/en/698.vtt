00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
It's a bit funny to be

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
at a conference dedicated to things not seen,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and present my proposal to build

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
a 6,000-kilometer-long wall

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
across the entire African continent.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
About the size of the Great Wall of China,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
this would hardly be an invisible structure.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And yet it's made from parts that are invisible, or near-invisible, to the naked eye:

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
bacteria and grains of sand.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Now, as architects we're trained to solve problems.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
But I don't really believe in architectural problems;

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I only believe in opportunities.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Which is why I'll show you a threat,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and an architectural response.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The threat is desertification.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
My response is a sandstone wall

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
made from bacteria and solidified sand,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
stretching across the desert.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Now, sand is a magical material

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
of beautiful contradictions.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
It is simple and complex.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
It is peaceful and violent.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
It is always the same, never the same,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
endlessly fascinating.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
One billion grains of sand

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
come into existence in the world each second.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
That's a cyclical process.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
As rocks and mountains die,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
grains of sand are born.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Some of those grains may then cement naturally into sandstone.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And as the sandstone weathers, new grains break free.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Some of those grains may then accumulate

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
on a massive scale,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
into a sand dune.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
In a way, the static, stone mountain

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
becomes a moving mountain of sand.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
But, moving mountains can be dangerous. Let me try and explain why.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Dry areas cover more than one third of the Earth's land surfaces.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Some are already deserts;

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
others are being seriously degraded by the sand.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Just south of the Sahara we find the Sahel.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
The name means "edge of the desert."

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And this is the region most closely associated with desertification.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
It was here in the late '60s and early '70s

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
that major droughts brought three million people

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
to become dependent upon emergency food aid,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
with about up to 250,000 dying.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
This is a catastrophe waiting to happen again.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And it's one that gets very little attention.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
In our accelerated media culture,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
desertification is simply too slow

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
to reach the headlines.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
It's nothing like a tsunami or a Katrina:

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
too few crying children and smashed up houses.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And yet desertification

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
is a major threat on all continents,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
affecting some 110 countries

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and about 70 percent of the world's agricultural drylands.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
It seriously threatens the livelihoods

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
of millions of people,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and especially in Africa and China.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And it is largely an issue that we've created for ourselves

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
through unsustainable use of scarce resources.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
So, we get climate change.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
We get droughts,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
increased desertification,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
crashing food systems, water scarcity,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
famine, forced migration,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
political instability, warfare, crisis.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
That's a potential scenario

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
if we fail to take this seriously.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
But, how far away is it?

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
I went to Sokoto in northern Nigeria

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
to try and find out how far away it is.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
The dunes here move southward at a pace of around 600 meters a year.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
That's the Sahara eating up almost [two meters] a day of the arable land,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
physically pushing people away from their homes.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Here I am -- I'm the second person on the left --

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
(Laughter)

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
with the elders in Gidan-Kara,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
a tiny village outside of Sokoto.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
They had to move this village in 1987

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
as a huge dune threatened to swallow it.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
So, they moved the entire village, hut by hut.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
This is where the village used to be.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
It took us about 10 minutes to climb up to the top of that dune,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
which goes to show why they had to move to a safer location.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
That's the kind of forced migration

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
that desertification can lead to.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
If you happen to live close to the desert border,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
you can pretty much calculate how long it will be

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
before you have to carry your kids away,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
and abandon your home and your life as you know it.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Now, sand dunes cover only about one fifth of our deserts.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
And still, those extreme environments are very good places

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
if we want to stop the shifting sands.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Four years ago, 23 African countries

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
came together to create the Great Green Wall Sahara.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
A fantastic project, the initial plan

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
called for a shelter belt of trees to be planted

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
right across the African continent,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
from Mauritania in the west, all the way to Djibouti in the east.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
If you want to stop a sand dune from moving,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
what you need to make sure to do is to stop the grains

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
from avalanching over its crest.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And a good way of doing that, the most efficient way,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
is to use some kind of sand catcher.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Trees or cacti are good for this.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
But, one of the problems with planting trees is that

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
the people in these regions are so poor

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
that they chop them down for firewood.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Now there is an alternative to just planting trees

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
and hoping that they won't get chopped down.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
This sandstone wall that I'm proposing essentially does three things.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
It adds roughness to the dune's surface,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
to the texture of the dune's surface, binding the grains.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
It provides a physical support structure for the trees,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
and it creates physical spaces,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
habitable spaces inside of the sand dunes.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
If people live inside of the green barrier

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
they can help support the trees, protect them from humans,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and from some of the forces of nature.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Inside of the dunes we find shade.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
We can start harvesting condensation,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
and start greening the desert from within.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Sand dunes are almost like ready-made buildings in a way.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
All we need to do is solidify the parts that we need to be solid,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
and then excavate the sand,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
and we have our architecture.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
We can either excavate it by hand

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
or we can have the wind excavate it for us.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
So, the wind carries the sand onto the site

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
and then it carries the redundant sand away from the structure for us.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
But, by now, you're probably asking,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
how am I planning to solidify a sand dune?

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
How do we glue those grains of sand together?

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
And the answer is, perhaps, that you use these guys,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Bacillus pasteurii,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
a micro-organism that is readily available in wetlands

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and marshes, and does precisely that.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
It takes a pile of loose sand

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
and it creates sandstone out of it.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
These images from the American Society for Microbiology show us the process.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
What happens is, you pour Bacillus pasteurii onto a pile of sand,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
and it starts filling up the voids in between the grains.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
A chemical process produces calcite,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
which is a kind of natural cement

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
that binds the grains together.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
The whole cementation process takes about 24 hours.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
I learned about this from a professor at U.C. Davis called Jason DeJong.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
He managed to do it in a mere 1,400 minutes.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Here I am, playing the part of the mad scientist,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
working with the bugs at UCL in London,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
trying to solidify them.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
So, how much would this cost?

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
I'm not an economist, very much not,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
but I did, quite literally, a back of the envelope calculation --

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
(Laughter)

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
-- and it seems that for a cubic meter of concrete

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
we would have to pay in the region of 90 dollars.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
And, after an initial cost of 60 bucks to buy the bacteria,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
which you'll never have to pay again,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
one cubic meter of bacterial sand

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
would be about 11 dollars.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
How do we construct something like this?

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Well, I'll quickly show you two options.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
The first is to create a kind of balloon structure,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
fill it with bacteria, then allow the sand to wash over the balloon,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
pop the balloon, as it were, disseminating the bacteria into the sand and solidifying it.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Then, a few years afterwards,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
using permacultural strategies,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
we green that part of the desert.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
The second alternative would be to use injection piles.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
So, we pushed the piles down through the dune,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
and we create an initial bacterial surface.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
We then pull the piles up through the dune

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
and we're able to create almost any conceivable shape inside of the sand

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
with the sand acting as a mold as we go up.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
So, we have a way of turning sand into sandstone,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
and then creating these habitable spaces inside of the desert dunes.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
But, what should they look like?

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Well, I was inspired, for my architectural form, by tafoni,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
which look a little bit like this, this is a model representation of it.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
These are cavernous rock structures that I found on the site in Sokoto.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
And I realized that if I scaled them up, they would provide me

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
with good spatial qualities,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
for ventilation, for thermal comfort, and for other things.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Now, part of the formal control over this structure

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
would be lost to nature, obviously,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
as the bacteria do their work.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
And I think this creates a kind of boundless beauty actually.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
I think there is really something in that articulation

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
that is quite nice.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
We see the result, the traces, if you like,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
of the Bacillus pasteurii being harnessed to sculpt the desert

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
into these habitable environments.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Some people believe that

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
this would spread uncontrollably,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
and that the bacteria would kill everything in its way.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
That's not true at all.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
It's a natural process. It goes on in nature today,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
and the bacteria die as soon as we stop feeding them.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
So, there it is --

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
architectural anti-desertification structures

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
made from the desert itself.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Sand-stopping devices, made from sand.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
The world is likely to lose one third of its arable land

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
by the end of the century.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
In a period of unprecedented population growth

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
and increased food demands, this could prove disastrous.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
And quite frankly, we're putting our heads in the sand.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
If nothing else, I would like for this scheme to initiate a discussion.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
But, if I had something like a TED wish,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
it would be to actually get it built,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
to start building this habitable wall,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
this very, very long, but very narrow city in the desert,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000
built into the dunescape itself.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
It's not only something that supports trees,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
but something that connects people and countries together.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000
I would like to conclude by showing you an animation of the structure,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:31.000
and leave you with a sentence by Jorge Luis Borges.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Borges said that "nothing is built on stone,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
everything is built on sand,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
but we must build as if the sand were stone."

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Now, there are many details left to explore in this scheme --

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
political, practical, ethical, financial.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
My design, as it takes you down the rabbit hole,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
is fraught with many challenges

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
and difficulties in the real world.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
But, it's a beginning, it's a vision.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
As Borges would have it, it's the sand.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
And I think now is really the time

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
to turn it into stone. Thank you.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
