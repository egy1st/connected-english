00:00:00.031 --> 00:00:03.321
This is really a two-hour presentation
I give to high school students,

00:00:03.345 --> 00:00:04.596
cut down to three minutes.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.261
And it all started one day
on a plane, on my way to TED,

00:00:07.285 --> 00:00:08.579
seven years ago.

00:00:08.603 --> 00:00:12.976
And in the seat next to me
was a high school student, a teenager,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.007
and she came from a really poor family.

00:00:15.483 --> 00:00:17.976
And she wanted to make
something of her life,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.039
and she asked me a simple little question.

00:00:20.063 --> 00:00:22.008
She said, "What leads to success?"

00:00:22.032 --> 00:00:23.411
And I felt really badly,

00:00:23.435 --> 00:00:25.896
because I couldn't give her a good answer.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.976
So I get off the plane, and I come to TED.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.730
And I think, jeez, I'm in the middle
of a room of successful people!

00:00:31.754 --> 00:00:34.365
So why don't I ask them
what helped them succeed,

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:36.103
and pass it on to kids?

00:00:36.817 --> 00:00:40.426
So here we are, seven years,
500 interviews later,

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.390
and I'm going to tell you
what really leads to success

00:00:43.414 --> 00:00:44.779
and makes TEDsters tick.

00:00:45.367 --> 00:00:46.976
And the first thing is passion.

00:00:47.787 --> 00:00:50.319
Freeman Thomas says,
"I'm driven by my passion."

00:00:50.763 --> 00:00:53.223
TEDsters do it for love;
they don't do it for money.

00:00:53.247 --> 00:00:56.731
Carol Coletta says, "I would pay
someone to do what I do."

00:00:56.755 --> 00:00:58.166
And the interesting thing is:

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.381
if you do it for love,
the money comes anyway.

00:01:00.866 --> 00:01:03.976
Work! Rupert Murdoch said
to me, "It's all hard work.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.083
Nothing comes easily.
But I have a lot of fun."

00:01:07.107 --> 00:01:09.977
Did he say fun? Rupert? Yes!

00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:11.477
(Laughter)

00:01:11.501 --> 00:01:14.247
TEDsters do have fun working.
And they work hard.

00:01:14.271 --> 00:01:17.224
I figured, they're not workaholics.
They're workafrolics.

00:01:17.248 --> 00:01:18.838
(Laughter)

00:01:18.862 --> 00:01:19.919
Good!

00:01:19.943 --> 00:01:20.944
(Applause)

00:01:20.968 --> 00:01:24.314
Alex Garden says, "To be successful,
put your nose down in something

00:01:24.338 --> 00:01:25.584
and get damn good at it."

00:01:25.608 --> 00:01:28.450
There's no magic;
it's practice, practice, practice.

00:01:28.474 --> 00:01:29.493
And it's focus.

00:01:29.517 --> 00:01:31.251
Norman Jewison said to me,

00:01:31.275 --> 00:01:34.267
"I think it all has to do
with focusing yourself on one thing."

00:01:34.773 --> 00:01:35.838
And push!

00:01:36.235 --> 00:01:38.223
David Gallo says, "Push yourself.

00:01:38.247 --> 00:01:40.889
Physically, mentally,
you've got to push, push, push."

00:01:40.913 --> 00:01:43.524
You've got to push through shyness
and self-doubt.

00:01:43.548 --> 00:01:45.976
Goldie Hawn says,
"I always had self-doubts.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.096
I wasn't good enough;
I wasn't smart enough.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.663
I didn't think I'd make it."

00:01:50.264 --> 00:01:52.303
Now it's not always easy to push yourself,

00:01:52.327 --> 00:01:54.415
and that's why they invented mothers.

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:55.439
(Laughter)

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.000
(Applause)

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.976
Frank Gehry said to me,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.370
"My mother pushed me."

00:02:01.394 --> 00:02:02.608
(Laughter)

00:02:02.632 --> 00:02:03.648
Serve!

00:02:04.427 --> 00:02:07.466
Sherwin Nuland says,
"It was a privilege to serve as a doctor."

00:02:08.093 --> 00:02:10.203
A lot of kids want to be millionaires.

00:02:10.227 --> 00:02:11.477
The first thing I say is:

00:02:11.501 --> 00:02:13.403
"OK, well you can't serve yourself;

00:02:13.427 --> 00:02:15.664
you've got to serve others
something of value.

00:02:15.688 --> 00:02:18.225
Because that's the way
people really get rich."

00:02:19.074 --> 00:02:20.099
Ideas!

00:02:20.123 --> 00:02:22.976
TEDster Bill Gates says, "I had an idea:

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.976
founding the first micro-computer
software company."

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.976
I'd say it was a pretty good idea.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.976
And there's no magic to creativity
in coming up with ideas --

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.335
it's just doing some very simple things.

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:34.976
And I give lots of evidence.

00:02:35.291 --> 00:02:36.405
Persist!

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:37.800
Joe Kraus says,

00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:40.418
"Persistence is the number
one reason for our success."

00:02:40.832 --> 00:02:44.374
You've got to persist through failure.
You've got to persist through crap!

00:02:44.398 --> 00:02:47.913
Which of course means "Criticism,
Rejection, Assholes and Pressure."

00:02:47.937 --> 00:02:50.703
(Laughter)

00:02:50.727 --> 00:02:54.446
So, the answer to this question is simple:

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.595
Pay 4,000 bucks and come to TED.

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:57.812
(Laughter)

00:02:57.836 --> 00:03:00.574
Or failing that, do
the eight things -- and trust me,

00:03:00.598 --> 00:03:03.818
these are the big eight things
that lead to success.

00:03:03.842 --> 00:03:06.561
Thank you TEDsters
for all your interviews!

00:03:06.585 --> 00:03:09.585
(Applause)
