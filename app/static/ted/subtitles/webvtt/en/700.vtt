00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.381
Chris Anderson: Thank you
so much, Prime Minister,

00:00:10.405 --> 00:00:12.596
that was both fascinating
and quite inspiring.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.302
So, you're calling for a global ethic.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.976
Would you describe that
as global citizenship?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.191
Is that an idea that you believe in,
and how would you define that?

00:00:23.215 --> 00:00:25.341
Gordon Brown: It is
about global citizenship

00:00:25.365 --> 00:00:27.562
and recognizing
our responsibilities to others.

00:00:27.586 --> 00:00:30.976
There is so much to do
over the next few years

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.976
that is obvious to so many of us

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.636
to build a better world.

00:00:36.176 --> 00:00:40.542
And there is so much shared sense
of what we need to do,

00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:42.572
that it is vital
that we all come together.

00:00:42.596 --> 00:00:45.298
But we don't necessarily have
the means to do so.

00:00:45.322 --> 00:00:47.116
So there are challenges to be met.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.976
I believe the concept
of global citizenship

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.976
will simply grow out of people talking
to each other across continents.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.434
But of course the task
is to create the institutions

00:00:56.458 --> 00:00:58.394
that make that global society work.

00:00:58.418 --> 00:01:00.379
But I don't think we should underestimate

00:01:00.403 --> 00:01:02.976
the extent to which
massive changes in technology

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.185
make possible the linking up
of people across the world.

00:01:06.209 --> 00:01:09.976
CA: But people get excited
about this idea of global citizenship,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.976
but then they get confused a bit again

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
when they start thinking about patriotism,

00:01:14.024 --> 00:01:15.738
and how to combine these two.

00:01:15.762 --> 00:01:17.976
I mean, you're elected as Prime Minister

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.292
with a brief to bat for Britain.

00:01:21.316 --> 00:01:24.396
How do you reconcile the two things?

00:01:24.921 --> 00:01:27.898
GB: Well, of course national identity
remains important.

00:01:27.922 --> 00:01:31.638
But it's not at the expense of people
accepting their global responsibilities.

00:01:31.662 --> 00:01:34.716
And I think one
of the problems of recession

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.843
is that people become more protectionist,

00:01:37.867 --> 00:01:39.652
they look in on themselves,

00:01:39.676 --> 00:01:41.976
they try to protect their own nation,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.248
perhaps at the expense of other nations.

00:01:45.272 --> 00:01:47.976
When you actually look
at the motor of the world economy,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.737
it cannot move forward

00:01:49.761 --> 00:01:52.656
unless there is trade
between the different countries.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.195
And any nation that would become
protectionist over the next few years

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.976
would deprive itself of the chance
of getting the benefits

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.076
of growth in the world economy.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.338
So, you've got to have
a healthy sense of patriotism;

00:02:04.362 --> 00:02:05.742
that's absolutely important.

00:02:05.766 --> 00:02:09.052
But you've got to realize
that this world has changed fundamentally,

00:02:09.076 --> 00:02:12.976
and the problems we have cannot be solved
by one nation and one nation alone.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.137
CA: Well, indeed.

00:02:14.161 --> 00:02:17.476
But what do you do
when the two come into conflict

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.501
and you're forced to make a decision

00:02:19.525 --> 00:02:23.976
that either is in Britain's interest,
or the interest of Britons,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.359
or citizens elsewhere in the world?

00:02:26.383 --> 00:02:28.386
GB: Well I think we can persuade people

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.976
that what is necessary
for Britain's long-term interests,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.429
what is necessary
for America's long-term interests,

00:02:34.453 --> 00:02:36.739
is proper engagement
with the rest of the world,

00:02:36.763 --> 00:02:41.670
and taking the action that is necessary.

00:02:41.694 --> 00:02:46.467
There is a great story, again,
told about Richard Nixon.

00:02:46.491 --> 00:02:50.442
1958, Ghana becomes independent,

00:02:50.466 --> 00:02:52.254
so it is just over 50 years ago.

00:02:52.873 --> 00:02:56.864
Richard Nixon goes to represent
the United States government

00:02:56.888 --> 00:02:59.864
at the celebrations
for independence in Ghana.

00:03:00.331 --> 00:03:04.976
And it's one of his first outings
as Vice President to an African country.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.640
He doesn't quite know what to do,

00:03:06.664 --> 00:03:08.413
so he starts going around the crowd

00:03:08.437 --> 00:03:09.976
and starts talking to people

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.286
and he says to people
in this rather unique way,

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.527
"How does it feel to be free?"

00:03:14.551 --> 00:03:17.273
And he's going around,
"How does it feel to be free?"

00:03:17.297 --> 00:03:18.884
"How does it feel to be free?"

00:03:18.908 --> 00:03:20.010
And then someone says,

00:03:20.034 --> 00:03:22.181
"How should I know? I come from Alabama."

00:03:22.205 --> 00:03:24.976
(Laughter)

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.404
And that was the 1950s.

00:03:28.428 --> 00:03:32.698
Now, what is remarkable

00:03:32.722 --> 00:03:36.443
is that civil rights in America
were achieved in the 1960s.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.976
But what is equally remarkable

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.976
is socioeconomic rights in Africa
have not moved forward very fast

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.341
even since the age of colonialism.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.865
And yet, America and Africa
have got a common interest.

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.976
And we have got to realize
that if we don't link up

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.976
with those people who are sensible voices
and democratic voices in Africa,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.976
to work together for common causes,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.976
then the danger of Al Qaeda
and related groups

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.976
making progress in Africa is very big.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.976
So, I would say that what seems sometimes

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.818
to be altruism, in relation to Africa,
or in relation to developing countries,

00:04:11.842 --> 00:04:12.991
is more than that.

00:04:13.015 --> 00:04:16.309
It is enlightened self-interest
for us to work with other countries.

00:04:16.333 --> 00:04:18.183
And I would say that national interest

00:04:18.207 --> 00:04:20.316
and, if you like,
what is the global interest

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.420
to tackle poverty and climate change

00:04:22.444 --> 00:04:24.976
do, in the long run, come together.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.239
And whatever the short-run price
for taking action on climate change

00:04:28.263 --> 00:04:30.946
or on security, or taking action
to provide opportunities

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.235
for people for education,

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:34.461
these are prices that are worth paying

00:04:34.485 --> 00:04:36.976
so that you build
a stronger global society

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.385
where people feel able to feel
comfortable with each other

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:43.091
and are able to communicate
with each other in such a way

00:04:43.115 --> 00:04:46.456
that you can actually build stronger
links between different countries.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.976
CA: I still just want to draw
out on this issue.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.397
So, you're on vacation at a nice beach,

00:04:52.421 --> 00:04:55.628
and word comes through
that there's been a massive earthquake

00:04:55.652 --> 00:04:58.072
and that there is a tsunami
advancing on the beach.

00:04:58.096 --> 00:05:02.853
One end of the beach, there is a house
containing a family of five Nigerians.

00:05:02.877 --> 00:05:05.590
And at the other end of the beach
there is a single Brit.

00:05:06.157 --> 00:05:07.538
You have time to --

00:05:07.562 --> 00:05:09.483
(Laughter)

00:05:09.507 --> 00:05:11.841
you have time to alert one house.

00:05:11.865 --> 00:05:12.866
What do you do?

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:14.976
(Laughter)

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.976
GB: Modern communications.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.976
(Applause)

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.976
Alert both.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.436
(Applause)

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.905
I do agree that my responsibility

00:05:28.929 --> 00:05:32.096
is first of all to make sure
that people in our country are safe.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.430
And I wouldn't like anything
that is said today to suggest

00:05:35.454 --> 00:05:38.183
that I am diminishing the importance
of the responsibility

00:05:38.207 --> 00:05:40.222
that each leader
has for their own country.

00:05:40.627 --> 00:05:43.779
But I'm trying to suggest
that there is a huge opportunity

00:05:43.803 --> 00:05:46.096
open to us that was never
open to us before.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.168
But the power to communicate
across borders

00:05:48.192 --> 00:05:51.421
allows us to organize
the world in a different way.

00:05:51.952 --> 00:05:55.524
And I think, look at the tsunami,
it's a classic example.

00:05:55.548 --> 00:05:57.524
Where was the early warning systems?

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.786
Where was the world acting together

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.045
to deal with the problems
that they knew arose

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:05.502
from the potential for earthquakes,

00:06:05.526 --> 00:06:07.623
as well as the potential
for climate change?

00:06:07.647 --> 00:06:09.696
And when the world
starts to work together,

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.409
with better early-warning systems,

00:06:11.433 --> 00:06:14.115
you can deal with some
of these problems in a better way.

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:16.262
I just think we're not seeing,
at the moment,

00:06:16.286 --> 00:06:20.216
the huge opportunities open to us
by the ability of people to cooperate

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.217
in a world where either
there was isolationism before

00:06:23.241 --> 00:06:26.976
or there was limited alliances
based on convenience

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.466
which never actually took you to deal
with some of the central problems.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.468
CA: But I think this is the frustration

00:06:32.492 --> 00:06:35.712
that perhaps a lot of people have,
like people in the audience here,

00:06:35.736 --> 00:06:38.625
where we love the kind of language
that you're talking about.

00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:39.658
It is inspiring.

00:06:39.682 --> 00:06:42.976
A lot of us believe
that that has to be the world's future.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.976
And yet, when the situation changes,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.782
you suddenly hear
politicians talking as if,

00:06:48.806 --> 00:06:51.976
you know, for example,
the life of one American soldier

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.656
is worth countless numbers
of Iraqi civilians.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.235
When the pedal hits the metal,

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:01.235
the idealism can get moved away.

00:07:01.626 --> 00:07:07.096
I'm just wondering whether
you can see that changing over time,

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.976
whether you see in Britain

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.660
that there are changing attitudes,

00:07:10.684 --> 00:07:12.813
and that people are actually
more supportive

00:07:12.837 --> 00:07:15.836
of the kind of global ethic
that you talk about.

00:07:16.431 --> 00:07:19.280
GB: I think every religion, every faith,

00:07:19.304 --> 00:07:22.409
and I'm not just talking here
to people of faith or religion --

00:07:22.433 --> 00:07:26.060
it has this global ethic
at the center of its credo.

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:29.783
And whether it's Jewish
or whether it's Muslim

00:07:29.807 --> 00:07:32.640
or whether it's Hindu,
or whether it's Sikh,

00:07:32.664 --> 00:07:37.659
the same global ethic is at the heart
of each of these religions.

00:07:37.683 --> 00:07:39.976
So, I think you're dealing with something

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.791
that people instinctively
see as part of their moral sense.

00:07:44.815 --> 00:07:48.577
So you're building on something
that is not pure self-interest.

00:07:48.601 --> 00:07:52.578
You're building
on people's ideas and values --

00:07:52.602 --> 00:07:58.269
that perhaps they're candles
that burn very dimly on certain occasions.

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:02.878
But it is a set of values that cannot,
in my view, be extinguished.

00:08:02.902 --> 00:08:04.457
Then the question is,

00:08:04.481 --> 00:08:07.139
how do you make that change happen?

00:08:07.163 --> 00:08:11.051
How do you persuade people
that it is in their interest

00:08:11.075 --> 00:08:12.814
to build strong --

00:08:12.838 --> 00:08:14.342
After the Second World War,

00:08:14.366 --> 00:08:17.343
we built institutions, the United Nations,

00:08:17.367 --> 00:08:18.730
the IMF, the World Bank,

00:08:18.754 --> 00:08:21.588
the World Trade Organization,
the Marshall Plan.

00:08:21.612 --> 00:08:25.645
There was a period in which people
talked about an act of creation,

00:08:25.669 --> 00:08:27.646
because these institutions were so new.

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:30.781
But they are now out of date.
They don't deal with the problems.

00:08:30.805 --> 00:08:32.940
You can't deal
with the environmental problem

00:08:32.964 --> 00:08:34.439
through existing institutions.

00:08:34.463 --> 00:08:37.976
You can't deal with the security problem
in the way that you need to.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.572
You can't deal with the economic
and financial problem.

00:08:40.596 --> 00:08:42.976
So we have got to rebuild
our global institutions,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.219
build them in a way that is suitable
to the challenges of this time.

00:08:46.243 --> 00:08:49.311
And I believe that if you look
at the biggest challenge we face,

00:08:49.335 --> 00:08:51.977
it is to persuade people
to have the confidence

00:08:52.001 --> 00:08:54.482
that we can build a truly global society

00:08:54.506 --> 00:08:57.586
with the institutions
that are founded on these rules.

00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:59.927
So, I come back to my initial point.

00:08:59.951 --> 00:09:01.952
Sometimes you think things are impossible.

00:09:01.976 --> 00:09:03.929
Nobody would have said 50 years ago

00:09:03.953 --> 00:09:05.976
that apartheid would have gone in 1990,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.399
or that the Berlin wall would have fallen
at the turn of the '80s and '90s,

00:09:10.423 --> 00:09:12.197
or that polio could be eradicated,

00:09:12.221 --> 00:09:13.662
or perhaps 60 years ago,

00:09:13.686 --> 00:09:16.154
nobody would have said
a man could gone to the Moon.

00:09:16.178 --> 00:09:17.976
All these things have happened.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.976
By tackling the impossible,
you make the impossible possible.

00:09:21.416 --> 00:09:24.976
CA: And we have had a speaker
who said that very thing,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.419
and swallowed a sword right
after that, which was quite dramatic.

00:09:28.443 --> 00:09:29.576
(Laughter)

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.976
GB: Followed my sword and swallow.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.976
CA: But, surely a true global ethic
is for someone to say,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.662
"I believe that the life
of every human on the planet

00:09:39.686 --> 00:09:42.663
is worth the same, equal consideration,

00:09:42.687 --> 00:09:45.976
regardless of nationality and religion."

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.977
And you have politicians who have --

00:09:49.001 --> 00:09:50.054
you're elected.

00:09:50.078 --> 00:09:51.493
In a way, you can't say that.

00:09:51.517 --> 00:09:53.603
Even if, as a human being,
you believe that,

00:09:53.627 --> 00:09:54.996
you can't say that.

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.372
You're elected for Britain's interests.

00:09:57.396 --> 00:09:59.976
GB: We have a responsibility to protect.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.276
I mean look, 1918,
the Treaty of Versailles,

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:05.112
and all the treaties before that,

00:10:05.136 --> 00:10:07.263
the Treaty of Westphalia
and everything else,

00:10:07.287 --> 00:10:09.907
were about protecting
the sovereign right of countries

00:10:09.931 --> 00:10:11.250
to do what they want.

00:10:11.274 --> 00:10:13.526
Since then, the world has moved forward,

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:16.527
partly as a result of what happened
with the Holocaust,

00:10:16.551 --> 00:10:19.398
and people's concern
about the rights of individuals

00:10:19.422 --> 00:10:22.976
within territories
where they need protection,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.801
partly because of what we saw in Rwanda,

00:10:25.825 --> 00:10:27.802
partly because of what we saw in Bosnia.

00:10:27.826 --> 00:10:29.976
The idea of the responsibility to protect

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.976
all individuals who are in situations
where they are at humanitarian risk

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.048
is now being established as a principle
which governs the world.

00:10:37.072 --> 00:10:40.691
So, while I can't automatically say

00:10:40.715 --> 00:10:46.976
that Britain will rush to the aid
of any citizen of any country, in danger,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.976
I can say that Britain is in a position

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.976
where we're working with other countries

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.286
so that this idea
that you have a responsibility

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:59.588
to protect people who are victims
of either genocide or humanitarian attack,

00:10:59.612 --> 00:11:01.937
is something that is accepted
by the whole world.

00:11:01.961 --> 00:11:03.962
Now, in the end, that can only be achieved

00:11:03.986 --> 00:11:07.564
if your international institutions
work well enough to be able to do so.

00:11:07.588 --> 00:11:10.732
And that comes back to what the future
role of the United Nations,

00:11:10.756 --> 00:11:12.976
and what it can do, actually is.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.976
But, the responsibility to protect
is a new idea that is, in a sense,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.632
taken over from the idea
of self-determination

00:11:19.656 --> 00:11:22.403
as the principle governing
the international community.

00:11:22.427 --> 00:11:24.976
CA: Can you picture, in our lifetimes,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.420
a politician ever going out on a platform

00:11:28.444 --> 00:11:33.110
of the kind of full-form global ethic,
global citizenship?

00:11:33.618 --> 00:11:38.286
And basically saying, "I believe
that all people across the planet

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:39.761
have equal consideration,

00:11:39.785 --> 00:11:42.667
and if in power we will act in that way.

00:11:42.691 --> 00:11:44.968
And we believe that the people
of this country

00:11:44.992 --> 00:11:47.969
are also now global citizens
and will support that ethic."

00:11:47.993 --> 00:11:51.878
GB: Is that not what we're doing
in the debate about climate change?

00:11:51.902 --> 00:11:54.648
We're saying that you cannot solve

00:11:54.672 --> 00:11:56.976
the problem of climate change
in one country;

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.823
you've got to involve all countries.

00:11:58.847 --> 00:12:03.418
You're saying that you must, and you have
a duty to help those countries

00:12:03.442 --> 00:12:07.114
that cannot afford to deal with
the problems of climate change themselves.

00:12:07.138 --> 00:12:09.075
You're saying you want a deal

00:12:09.099 --> 00:12:11.210
with all the different
countries of the world

00:12:11.234 --> 00:12:12.846
where we're all bound together

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:16.976
to cutting carbon emissions in a way
that is to the benefit of the whole world.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.976
We've never had this before
because Kyoto didn't work.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.861
If you could get a deal at Copenhagen,
where people agreed,

00:12:24.885 --> 00:12:28.096
A, that there was a long-term target
for carbon emission cuts,

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.976
B, that there was short-range
targets that had to be met

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.787
so this wasn't just abstract;

00:12:32.811 --> 00:12:35.048
it was people actually
making decisions now

00:12:35.072 --> 00:12:36.836
that would make a difference now,

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:39.239
and if you could then find
a financing mechanism

00:12:39.263 --> 00:12:41.976
that meant that the poorest countries
that had been hurt

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.096
by our inability to deal
with climate change

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.976
over many, many years and decades

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.882
are given special help

00:12:47.906 --> 00:12:50.976
so that they can move
to energy-efficient technologies,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.794
and they are in a position financially

00:12:53.818 --> 00:12:56.143
to be able to afford
the long-term investment

00:12:56.167 --> 00:12:58.580
that is associated
with cutting carbon emissions,

00:12:58.604 --> 00:13:02.219
then you are treating the world equally,

00:13:02.243 --> 00:13:05.695
by giving consideration
to every part of the planet

00:13:05.719 --> 00:13:07.346
and the needs they have.

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:10.307
It doesn't mean that everybody
does exactly the same thing,

00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:12.639
because we've actually got
to do more financially

00:13:12.663 --> 00:13:14.107
to help the poorest countries,

00:13:14.131 --> 00:13:16.874
but it does mean
there is equal consideration

00:13:16.898 --> 00:13:20.357
for the needs of citizens
in a single planet.

00:13:20.381 --> 00:13:21.396
CA: Yes.

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:24.885
And then of course the theory
is still that those talks get rent apart

00:13:24.909 --> 00:13:28.143
by different countries fighting
over their own individual interests.

00:13:28.167 --> 00:13:30.852
GB: Yes, but I think
Europe has got a position,

00:13:30.876 --> 00:13:33.981
which is 27 countries have
already come together.

00:13:34.005 --> 00:13:35.976
I mean, the great difficulty in Europe

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.209
is if you're at a meeting
and 27 people speak,

00:13:38.233 --> 00:13:39.976
it takes a very, very long time.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.797
But we did get an agreement
on climate change.

00:13:43.821 --> 00:13:46.976
America has made
its first disposition on this

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.818
with the bill that President Obama
should be congratulated

00:13:50.842 --> 00:13:52.350
for getting through Congress.

00:13:52.374 --> 00:13:54.555
Japan has made an announcement.

00:13:54.579 --> 00:13:57.976
China and India have signed up
to the scientific evidence.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.844
And now we've got to move them to accept

00:14:00.868 --> 00:14:03.516
a long-term target,
and then short-term targets.

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:06.599
But more progress has been made,
I think, in the last few weeks

00:14:06.623 --> 00:14:08.323
than had been made for some years.

00:14:08.347 --> 00:14:11.627
And I do believe
that there is a strong possibility

00:14:11.651 --> 00:14:15.143
that if we work together, we can get
that agreement to Copenhagen.

00:14:15.167 --> 00:14:17.406
I certainly have been
putting forward proposals

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:20.239
that would have allowed
the poorest parts of the world

00:14:20.263 --> 00:14:24.306
to feel that we have taken into account
their specific needs.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:26.307
And we would help them adapt.

00:14:26.331 --> 00:14:30.048
And we would help them make
the transition to a low-carbon economy.

00:14:30.072 --> 00:14:33.834
I do think a reform of the international
institutions is vital to this.

00:14:33.858 --> 00:14:36.159
When the IMF was created in the 1940s,

00:14:36.183 --> 00:14:39.851
it was created with resources that were
five percent or so of the world's GDP.

00:14:39.875 --> 00:14:42.185
The IMF now has limited
resources, one percent.

00:14:42.209 --> 00:14:43.908
It can't really make the difference

00:14:43.932 --> 00:14:46.081
that ought to be made
in a period of crisis.

00:14:46.105 --> 00:14:48.976
So, we've got to rebuild
the world institutions.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.568
And that's a big task:

00:14:50.592 --> 00:14:52.422
persuading all the different countries

00:14:52.446 --> 00:14:55.491
with the different voting shares
in these institutions to do so.

00:14:55.515 --> 00:14:58.699
There is a story told
about the three world leaders

00:14:58.723 --> 00:15:02.853
of the day getting a chance
to get some advice from God.

00:15:03.381 --> 00:15:07.380
And the story is told
that Bill Clinton went to God

00:15:07.404 --> 00:15:12.570
and he asked when there will be
successful climate change

00:15:12.594 --> 00:15:14.143
and a low-carbon economy.

00:15:14.167 --> 00:15:15.754
And God shook his head and said,

00:15:15.778 --> 00:15:19.897
"Not this year, not this decade,
perhaps not even in [your] lifetime."

00:15:19.921 --> 00:15:22.976
And Bill Clinton walked away in tears

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.096
because he had failed
to get what he wanted.

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:28.745
And then the story is that Barroso,
the president of the European Commission,

00:15:28.769 --> 00:15:30.226
went to God and he asked,

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:34.595
"When will we get
a recovery of global growth?"

00:15:34.619 --> 00:15:36.954
And God said, "Not this year,
not in this decade,

00:15:36.978 --> 00:15:38.597
perhaps not in your lifetime."

00:15:38.621 --> 00:15:41.399
So Barroso walked away
crying and in tears.

00:15:42.377 --> 00:15:46.976
And then the Secretary-General
of the United Nations

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.464
came up to speak to God and said,

00:15:49.488 --> 00:15:52.048
"When will our international
institutions work?"

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:53.923
And God cried.

00:15:53.947 --> 00:15:57.705
(Laughter)

00:15:57.729 --> 00:16:04.375
It is very important to recognize
that this reform of institutions

00:16:04.399 --> 00:16:08.399
is the next stage after
agreeing upon ourselves

00:16:08.423 --> 00:16:10.898
that there is a clear ethic
upon which we can build.

00:16:11.634 --> 00:16:14.365
CA: Prime Minister, I think
there are many in the audience

00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:16.751
who are truly appreciative
of the efforts you made

00:16:16.775 --> 00:16:19.276
in terms of the financial mess
we got ourselves into.

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:21.929
And there are certainly
many people in the audience

00:16:21.953 --> 00:16:25.237
who will be cheering you on as you seek
to advance this global ethic.

00:16:25.261 --> 00:16:27.192
Thank you so much for coming to TED.

00:16:27.216 --> 00:16:28.525
GB: Well, thank you.

00:16:28.549 --> 00:16:31.549
(Applause)
