00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
How do you observe something you can't see?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This is the basic question of somebody who's interested

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
in finding and studying black holes.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Because black holes are objects

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
whose pull of gravity is so intense

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
that nothing can escape it, not even light,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
so you can't see it directly.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So, my story today about black holes

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
is about one particular black hole.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I'm interested in finding whether or not

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
there is a really massive, what we like to call

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
"supermassive" black hole at the center of our galaxy.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And the reason this is interesting is that

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
it gives us an opportunity to prove

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
whether or not these exotic objects really exist.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And second, it gives us the opportunity

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
to understand how these supermassive black holes

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
interact with their environment,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and to understand how they affect the formation and evolution

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
of the galaxies which they reside in.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So, to begin with,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
we need to understand what a black hole is

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
so we can understand the proof of a black hole.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So, what is a black hole?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Well, in many ways a black hole is an incredibly simple object,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
because there are only three characteristics that you can describe:

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
the mass,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
the spin, and the charge.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And I'm going to only talk about the mass.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So, in that sense, it's a very simple object.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
But in another sense, it's an incredibly complicated object

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
that we need relatively exotic physics to describe,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and in some sense represents the breakdown of our physical understanding

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
of the universe.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
But today, the way I want you to understand a black hole,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
for the proof of a black hole,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
is to think of it as an object

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
whose mass is confined to zero volume.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
So, despite the fact that I'm going to talk to you about

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
an object that's supermassive,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and I'm going to get to what that really means in a moment,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
it has no finite size.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
So, this is a little tricky.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
But fortunately there is a finite size that you can see,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and that's known as the Schwarzschild radius.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And that's named after the guy who recognized

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
why it was such an important radius.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
This is a virtual radius, not reality; the black hole has no size.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
So why is it so important?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
It's important because it tells us

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
that any object can become a black hole.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
That means you, your neighbor, your cellphone,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
the auditorium can become a black hole

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
if you can figure out how to compress it down

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
to the size of the Schwarzschild radius.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
At that point, what's going to happen?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
At that point gravity wins.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Gravity wins over all other known forces.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And the object is forced to continue to collapse

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
to an infinitely small object.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And then it's a black hole.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
So, if I were to compress the Earth down to the size of a sugar cube,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
it would become a black hole,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
because the size of a sugar cube is its Schwarzschild radius.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Now, the key here is to figure out what that Schwarzschild radius is.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And it turns out that it's actually pretty simple to figure out.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
It depends only on the mass of the object.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Bigger objects have bigger Schwarzschild radii.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Smaller objects have smaller Schwarzschild radii.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So, if I were to take the sun

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
and compress it down to the scale of the University of Oxford,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
it would become a black hole.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
So, now we know what a Schwarzschild radius is.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
And it's actually quite a useful concept,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
because it tells us not only

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
when a black hole will form,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
but it also gives us the key elements for the proof of a black hole.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
I only need two things.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
I need to understand the mass of the object

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
I'm claiming is a black hole,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
and what its Schwarzschild radius is.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And since the mass determines the Schwarzschild radius,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
there is actually only one thing I really need to know.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
So, my job in convincing you

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
that there is a black hole

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
is to show that there is some object

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
that's confined to within its Schwarzschild radius.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And your job today is to be skeptical.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Okay, so, I'm going to talk about no ordinary black hole;

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
I'm going to talk about supermassive black holes.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
So, I wanted to say a few words about what an ordinary black hole is,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
as if there could be such a thing as an ordinary black hole.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
An ordinary black hole is thought to be the end state

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
of a really massive star's life.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
So, if a star starts its life off

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
with much more mass than the mass of the Sun,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
it's going to end its life by exploding

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
and leaving behind these beautiful supernova remnants that we see here.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
And inside that supernova remnant

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
is going to be a little black hole

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
that has a mass roughly three times the mass of the Sun.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
On an astronomical scale

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
that's a very small black hole.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Now, what I want to talk about are the supermassive black holes.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
And the supermassive black holes are thought to reside at the center of galaxies.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
And this beautiful picture taken with the Hubble Space Telescope

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
shows you that galaxies come in all shapes and sizes.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
There are big ones. There are little ones.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Almost every object in that picture there is a galaxy.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And there is a very nice spiral up in the upper left.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
And there are a hundred billion stars in that galaxy,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
just to give you a sense of scale.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
And all the light that we see from a typical galaxy,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
which is the kind of galaxies that we're seeing here,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
comes from the light from the stars.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
So, we see the galaxy because of the star light.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Now, there are a few relatively exotic galaxies.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
I like to call these the prima donna of the galaxy world,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
because they are kind of show offs.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
And we call them active galactic nuclei.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And we call them that because their nucleus,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
or their center, are very active.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
So, at the center there, that's actually where

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
most of the starlight comes out from.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And yet, what we actually see is light

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
that can't be explained by the starlight.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
It's way more energetic.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
In fact, in a few examples it's like the ones that we're seeing here.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
There are also jets emanating out from the center.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Again, a source of energy that's very difficult to explain

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
if you just think that galaxies are composed of stars.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
So, what people have thought is that perhaps

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
there are supermassive black holes

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
which matter is falling on to.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
So, you can't see the black hole itself,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
but you can convert the gravitational energy of the black hole

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
into the light we see.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
So, there is the thought that maybe supermassive black holes

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
exist at the center of galaxies.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
But it's a kind of indirect argument.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Nonetheless, it's given rise to the notion

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
that maybe it's not just these prima donnas

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
that have these supermassive black holes,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
but rather all galaxies might harbor these

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
supermassive black holes at their centers.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And if that's the case -- and this is an example of a normal galaxy;

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
what we see is the star light.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
And if there is a supermassive black hole,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
what we need to assume is that it's a black hole on a diet.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Because that is the way to suppress the energetic phenomena that we see

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
in active galactic nuclei.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
If we're going to look for these stealth black holes

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
at the center of galaxies,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
the best place to look is in our own galaxy, our Milky Way.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And this is a wide field picture

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
taken of the center of the Milky Way.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
And what we see is a line of stars.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
And that is because we live in a galaxy which has

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
a flattened, disk-like structure.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And we live in the middle of it, so when we look towards the center,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
we see this plane which defines the plane of the galaxy,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
or line that defines the plane of the galaxy.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Now, the advantage of studying our own galaxy

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
is it's simply the closest example of the center of a galaxy

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
that we're ever going to have, because the next closest galaxy

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
is 100 times further away.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
So, we can see far more detail in our galaxy

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
than anyplace else.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
And as you'll see in a moment, the ability to see detail

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
is key to this experiment.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
So, how do astronomers prove that there is a lot of mass

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
inside a small volume?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Which is the job that I have to show you today.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
And the tool that we use is to watch the way

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
stars orbit the black hole.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Stars will orbit the black hole

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
in the very same way that planets orbit the sun.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
It's the gravitational pull

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
that makes these things orbit.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
If there were no massive objects these things would go flying off,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
or at least go at a much slower rate

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
because all that determines how they go around

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
is how much mass is inside its orbit.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
So, this is great, because remember my job is to show

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
there is a lot of mass inside a small volume.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
So, if I know how fast it goes around, I know the mass.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
And if I know the scale of the orbit I know the radius.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
So, I want to see the stars

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
that are as close to the center of the galaxy as possible.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Because I want to show there is a mass inside as small a region as possible.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
So, this means that I want to see a lot of detail.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
And that's the reason that for this experiment we've used

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
the world's largest telescope.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
This is the Keck observatory. It hosts two telescopes

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
with a mirror 10 meters, which is roughly

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
the diameter of a tennis court.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Now, this is wonderful,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
because the campaign promise

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
of large telescopes is that is that the bigger the telescope,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
the smaller the detail that we can see.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
But it turns out these telescopes, or any telescope on the ground

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
has had a little bit of a challenge living up to this campaign promise.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
And that is because of the atmosphere.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Atmosphere is great for us; it allows us

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
to survive here on Earth.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
But it's relatively challenging for astronomers

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
who want to look through the atmosphere to astronomical sources.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
So, to give you a sense of what this is like,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
it's actually like looking at a pebble

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
at the bottom of a stream.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Looking at the pebble on the bottom of the stream,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
the stream is continuously moving and turbulent,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
and that makes it very difficult to see the pebble on the bottom of the stream.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Very much in the same way, it's very difficult

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
to see astronomical sources, because of the

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
atmosphere that's continuously moving by.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
So, I've spent a lot of my career working on ways

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
to correct for the atmosphere, to give us a cleaner view.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
And that buys us about a factor of 20.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
And I think all of you can agree that if you can

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
figure out how to improve life by a factor of 20,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
you've probably improved your lifestyle by a lot,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000
say your salary, you'd notice, or your kids, you'd notice.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
And this animation here shows you one example of

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
the techniques that we use, called adaptive optics.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
You're seeing an animation that goes between

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
an example of what you would see if you don't use this technique --

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
in other words, just a picture that shows the stars --

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
and the box is centered on the center of the galaxy,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
where we think the black hole is.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
So, without this technology you can't see the stars.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
With this technology all of a sudden you can see it.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
This technology works by introducing a mirror

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
into the telescope optics system

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000
that's continuously changing to counteract what the atmosphere is doing to you.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
So, it's kind of like very fancy eyeglasses for your telescope.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Now, in the next few slides I'm just going to focus on

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
that little square there.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
So, we're only going to look at the stars inside that small square,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
although we've looked at all of them.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
So, I want to see how these things have moved.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
And over the course of this experiment, these stars

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
have moved a tremendous amount.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
So, we've been doing this experiment for 15 years,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
and we see the stars go all the way around.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Now, most astronomers have a favorite star,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
and mine today is a star that's labeled up there, SO-2.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Absolutely my favorite star in the world.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
And that's because it goes around in only 15 years.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
And to give you a sense of how short that is,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
the sun takes 200 million years to go around the center of the galaxy.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Stars that we knew about before, that were as close to the center of the galaxy

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
as possible, take 500 years.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000
And this one, this one goes around in a human lifetime.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
That's kind of profound, in a way.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
But it's the key to this experiment. The orbit tells me

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
how much mass is inside a very small radius.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
So, next we see a picture here that shows you

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
before this experiment the size to which we could

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
confine the mass of the center of the galaxy.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
What we knew before is that there was four million

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
times the mass of the sun inside that circle.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
And as you can see, there was a lot of other stuff inside that circle.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
You can see a lot of stars.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
So, there was actually lots of alternatives

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
to the idea that there was a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
because you could put a lot of stuff in there.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
But with this experiment, we've confined

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
that same mass to a much smaller volume

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
that's 10,000 times smaller.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
And because of that, we've been able to show

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
that there is a supermassive black hole there.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
To give you a sense of how small that size is,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
that's the size of our solar system.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
So, we're cramming four million times the mass of the sun

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
into that small volume.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Now, truth in advertising. Right?

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
I have told you my job is to get it down to the Schwarzchild radius.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
And the truth is, I'm not quite there.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
But we actually have no alternative today

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
to explaining this concentration of mass.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
And, in fact, it's the best evidence we have to date

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
for not only existence of a supermassive black hole

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
at the center of our own galaxy, but any in our universe.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
So, what next? I actually think

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
this is about as good as we're going to do with today's technology,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
so let's move on with the problem.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
So, what I want to tell you, very briefly,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
is a few examples

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
of the excitement of what we can do today

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
at the center of the galaxy, now that we know that there is,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
or at least we believe,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
that there is a supermassive black hole there.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
And the fun phase of this experiment

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
is, while we've tested some of our ideas

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
about the consequences of a supermassive black hole

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
being at the center of our galaxy,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
almost every single one

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
has been inconsistent with what we actually see.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
And that's the fun.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
So, let me give you the two examples.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
You can ask, "What do you expect

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
for the old stars, stars that have been around the center of the galaxy

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
for a long time, they've had plenty of time to interact with the black hole."

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
What you expect there is that old stars

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
should be very clustered around the black hole.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
You should see a lot of old stars next to that black hole.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Likewise, for the young stars, or in contrast, the young stars,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
they just should not be there.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
A black hole does not make a kind neighbor to a stellar nursery.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
To get a star to form, you need a big ball of gas and dust to collapse.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And it's a very fragile entity.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
And what does the big black hole do?

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
It strips that gas cloud apart.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
It pulls much stronger on one side than the other

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
and the cloud is stripped apart.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
In fact, we anticipated that star formation shouldn't proceed in that environment.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
So, you shouldn't see young stars.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
So, what do we see?

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Using observations that are not the ones I've shown you today,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
we can actually figure out which ones are old and which ones are young.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
The old ones are red.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
The young ones are blue. And the yellow ones, we don't know yet.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
So, you can already see the surprise.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
There is a dearth of old stars.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
There is an abundance of young stars, so it's the exact opposite of the prediction.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
So, this is the fun part.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
And in fact, today, this is what we're trying to figure out,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
this mystery of how do you get --

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
how do you resolve this contradiction.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
So, in fact, my graduate students

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
are, at this very moment, today, at the telescope,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
in Hawaii, making observations to get us

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
hopefully to the next stage,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
where we can address this question

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
of why are there so many young stars,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
and so few old stars.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
To make further progress we really need to look at the orbits

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
of stars that are much further away.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
To do that we'll probably need much more

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
sophisticated technology than we have today.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Because, in truth, while I said we're correcting

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
for the Earth's atmosphere, we actually only

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
correct for half the errors that are introduced.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
We do this by shooting a laser up into the atmosphere,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
and what we think we can do is if we

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
shine a few more that we can correct the rest.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
So this is what we hope to do in the next few years.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
And on a much longer time scale,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
what we hope to do is build even larger telescopes,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
because, remember, bigger is better in astronomy.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
So, we want to build a 30 meter telescope.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
And with this telescope we should be able to see

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
stars that are even closer to the center of the galaxy.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
And we hope to be able to test some of

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
Einstein's theories of general relativity,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
some ideas in cosmology about how galaxies form.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
So, we think the future of this experiment

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
is quite exciting.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
So, in conclusion, I'm going to show you an animation

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
that basically shows you how these

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
orbits have been moving, in three dimensions.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
And I hope, if nothing else,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
I've convinced you that, one, we do in fact

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
have a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
And this means that these things do exist in our universe,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
and we have to contend with this, we have to explain

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
how you can get these objects in our physical world.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Second, we've been able to look at that interaction

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
of how supermassive black holes interact,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
and understand, maybe, the role in which they play

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
in shaping what galaxies are, and how they work.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
And last but not least,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
none of this would have happened

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
without the advent of the tremendous progress

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
that's been made on the technology front.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
And we think that this is a field that is moving incredibly fast,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
and holds a lot in store for the future.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Thanks very much.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
(Applause)
