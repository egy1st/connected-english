WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
For emotions, we should not move quickly to the desert.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So, first, a small housekeeping announcement:

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
please switch off your

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
proper English check programs

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
installed in your brain.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
(Applause)

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So, welcome to the Golden Desert, Indian desert.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It receives the least rainfall in the country,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
lowest rainfall.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
If you are well-versed with inches, nine inches,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
centimeters, 16 [centimeters].

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The groundwater is 300 feet deep, 100 meters.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And in most parts it is saline, not fit for drinking.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So, you can't install hand pumps or dig wells,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
though there is no electricity in most of the villages.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
But suppose you use the green technology, solar pumps --

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
they are of no use in this area.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So, welcome to the Golden Desert.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Clouds seldom visit this area.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:19.000
But we find 40 different names of clouds in this dialect used here.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
There are a number of techniques to harvest rain.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
This is a new work, it's a new program.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
But for the desert society

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
this is no program; this is their life.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And they harvest rain in many ways.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So, this is the first device they use

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
in harvesting rain.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
It's called kunds; somewhere it is called [unclear].

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And you can notice they have created

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
a kind of false catchment.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
The desert is there, sand dunes, some small field.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And this is all big raised platform.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
You can notice the small holes

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
the water will fall on this catchment,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and there is a slope.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Sometimes our engineers and architects

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
do not care about slopes in bathrooms,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
but here they will care properly.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And the water will go where it should go.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And then it is 40 feet deep.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
The waterproofing is done perfectly,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
better than our city contractors,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
because not a single drop should go waste in this.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
They collect 100 thousand liters in one season.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And this is pure drinking water.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Below the surface there is hard saline water.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
But now you can have this for year round.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
It's two houses.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
We often use a term called bylaws.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Because we are used to get written things.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
But here it is unwritten by law.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And people made their house,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
and the water storage tanks.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000
These raised up platforms just like this stage.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
In fact they go 15 feet deep,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and collect rain water from roof,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
there is a small pipe, and from their courtyard.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.000
It can also harvest something like 25,000 in a good monsoon.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Another big one,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.000
this is of course out of the hardcore desert area.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
This is near Jaipur. This is called the Jaigarh Fort.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And it can collect six million gallons of rainwater in one season.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
The age is 400 years.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
So, since 400 years it has been giving you

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
almost six million gallons of water per season.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
You can calculate the price of that water.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.000
It draws water from 15 kilometers of canals.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
You can see a modern road, hardly 50 years old.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
It can break sometimes.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
But this 400 year old canal, which draws water,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
it is maintained for so many generations.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Of course if you want to go inside, the two doors are locked.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
But they can be opened for TED people.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000
(Laughter)

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And we request them.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
You can see person coming up with

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
two canisters of water.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And the water level -- these are not empty canisters --

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
water level is right up to this.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
It can envy many municipalities,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.000
the color, the taste, the purity of this water.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
And this is what they call Zero B type of water,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
because it comes from the clouds,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
pure distilled water.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
We stop for a quick commercial break,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
and then we come back to the traditional systems.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
The government thought that this is a very

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
backward area and we should bring

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
a multi-million dollar project

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
to bring water from the Himalayas.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
That's why I said that this is a commercial break.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000
(Laughter)

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
But we will come back, once again,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
to the traditional thing.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
So, water from 300, 400 kilometers away,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
soon it become like this.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
In many portions, water hyacinth

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
covered these big canals like anything.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Of course there are some areas where water is reaching,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
I'm not saying that it is not reaching at all.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
But the tail end, the Jaisalmer area,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
you will notice in Bikaner things like this:

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
where the water hyacinth couldn't grow,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
the sand is flowing in these canals.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
The bonus is that you can find wildlife around it.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
(Laughter)

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
We had full-page advertisements,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
some 30 years, 25 years ago when this canal came.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
They said that throw away your traditional systems,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
these new cement tanks will supply you piped water.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
It's a dream. And it became a dream also.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Because soon the water was not able to reach these areas.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
And people started renovating their own structures.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
These are all traditional water structures,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
which we won't be able to explain in such a short time.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
But you can see that no woman is standing on those.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000
(Laughter)

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And they are plaiting hair.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
(Applause)

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Jaisalmer. This is heart of desert.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
This town was established 800 years ago.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
I'm not sure by that time

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Bombay was there, or Delhi was there,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
or Chennai was there, or Bangalore was there.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
So, this was the terminal point for silk route.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Well connected, 800 years ago, through Europe.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
None of us were able to go to Europe,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
but Jaisalmer was well connected to it.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
And this is the 16 centimeter area.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Such a limited rainfall,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000
and highest colorful life flourished in these areas.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
You won't find water in this slide.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
But it is invisible.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Somewhere a stream or a rivulet

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
is running through here.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Or, if you want to paint, you can paint it blue throughout

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
because every roof which you see in this picture

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
collects rainwater drops

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000
and deposit in the rooms.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
But apart from this system,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:10.000
they designed 52 beautiful water bodies around this town.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
And what we call private public partnership

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
you can add estate also.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
So, estate, public and private entrepreneurs

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
work together to build this beautiful water body.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And it's a kind of water body for all seasons.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
You will admire it. Just behold the beauty throughout the year.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Whether water level goes up or down,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
the beauty is there throughout.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Another water body, dried up, of course,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
during the summer period,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
but you can see how the traditional society

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
combines engineering with aesthetics, with the heart.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
These statues, marvelous statues,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
gives you an idea of water table.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
When this rain comes and the water starts filling this tank,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
it will submerge these beautiful statues

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
in what we call in English today "mass communication."

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
This was for mass communication.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Everybody in the town will know that this elephant has drowned,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
so water will be there for seven months or nine months,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
or 12 months.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
And then they will come and worship this pond,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
pay respect, their gratitude.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Another small water body, called the [unclear].

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
It is difficult to translate in English,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
especially in my English.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
But the nearest would be "glory," a reputation.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
The reputation in desert of this small water body is

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
that it never dries up.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
In severe drought periods

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
nobody has seen this water body

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
getting dried up.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:59.000
And perhaps they knew the future also.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
It was designed some 150 years ago.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
But perhaps they knew that on sixth, November, 2009,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
there will be a TED green and blue session,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
so they painted it like this.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000
(Laughter)

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.000
(Applause)

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Dry water body. Children are standing on

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
a very difficult device to explain.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
This is called kund. We have, in English, surface water and ground water.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
But this is not ground water.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
You can draw ground water from any well.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
But this is no ordinary well.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
It squeeze the moisture

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
hidden in the sand.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
And they have dubbed this water as the third one called [unclear].

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
And there is a gypsum belt running below it.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
And it was deposited by the great mother Earth,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
some three million years ago.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
And where we have this gypsum strip

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
they can harvest this water.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
This is the same dry water body.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Now, you don't find any kund;

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
they are all submerged.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
But when the water goes down they will be able

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
to draw water from those structures throughout the year.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
This year they have received only six centimeters.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Six centimeter of rainfall,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
and they can telephone you

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
that if you find any water problem in your city,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Delhi, Bombay, Bangalore, Mysore,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
please come to our area of six centimeters, we can give you water.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000
(Laughter)

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
How they maintain them?

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
There are three things: concept, planning,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
making the actual thing, and also maintaining them.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
It is a structure for maintain,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000
for centuries, by generations, without any department,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
without any funding,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
So the secret is "[unclear]," respect.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Your own thing, not personal property,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
my property, every time.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
So, these stone pillars

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
will remind you that you are entering into a water body area.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Don't spit, don't do anything wrong,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
so that the clean water can be collected.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Another pillar, stone pillar on your right side.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
If you climb these three, six steps

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
you will find something very nice.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
This was done in 11th century.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
And you have to go further down.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
They say that a picture is worth a thousand words,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
so we can say a thousand words right now,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
an another thousand words.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
If the water table goes down,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
you will find new stairs.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
If it comes up, some of them will be submerged.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
So, throughout the year

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000
this beautiful system will give you some pleasure.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Three sides, such steps, on the fourth side

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
there is a four-story building

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
where you can organize such TED conferences anytime.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:08.000
(Applause)

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Excuse me, who built these structures?

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
They are in front of you.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
The best civil engineers we had, the best planners,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
the best architects.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
We can say that because of them,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
because of their forefathers,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
India could get the first engineering college

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
in 1847.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
There were no English medium schools at that time,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
even no Hindi schools, [unclear] schools.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
But such people, compelled to the East India Company,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
which came here for business, a very dirty kind of business ...

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
(Laughter)

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
but not to create the engineering colleges.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
But because of them, first engineering college was created

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
in a small village, not in the town.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
The last point, we all know in our primary schools that

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
that camel is a ship of desert.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
So, you can find through your Jeep,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
a camel, and a cart.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
This tire comes from the airplane.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
So, look at the beauty from the desert society

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
who can harvest rainwater,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
and also create something

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
through a tire from a jet plane,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
and used in a camel cart.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Last picture, it's a tattoo,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
2,000-years-old tattoo.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
They were using it on their body.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Tattoo was, at one time,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
a kind of a blacklisted

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
or con thing, but now it is in thing.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
(Laughter)

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
(Applause)

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
You can copy this tattoo. I have some posters of this.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
(Laughter)

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000
The center of life is water.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
These are the beautiful waves.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
These are the beautiful stairs

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
which we just saw in one of the slides.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
These are the trees.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
And these are the flowers which

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
add fragrance to our lives.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
So, this is the message of desert.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Thank you very much.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:45.000
(Applause)

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Chris Anderson: So, first of all, I wish I had your eloquence, truly, in any language.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:56.000
(Applause)

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:02.000
These artifacts and designs are inspiring.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Do you believe that they can be used elsewhere,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
that the world can learn from this?

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Or is this just right for this place?

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Anupam Mishra: No, the basic idea is to

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
utilize water that falls on our area.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
So, the ponds, the open bodies, are everywhere,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000
right from Sri Lanka to Kashmir, and in other parts also.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
And these [unclear], which stored water,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
there are two type of things.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
One recharge, and one stores.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
So, it depends on the terrain.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
But kund, which uses the gypsum belt,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
for that you have to go back to your calendar,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
three million years ago.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
If it is there it can be done right now.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Otherwise, it can't be done.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000
(Laughter)

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
(Applause)

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
CA: Thank you so much.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
(Applause)
