00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm talking to you about

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
the worst form of human rights violation,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
the third-largest organized crime,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
a $10 billion industry.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I'm talking to you about modern-day slavery.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I'd like to tell you the story

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
of these three children,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Pranitha, Shaheen and Anjali.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Pranitha's mother was a woman in prostitution,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
a prostituted person.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
She got infected with HIV,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and towards the end of her life,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
when she was in the final stages of AIDS,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
she could not prostitute,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
so she sold four-year-old Pranitha to a broker.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
By the time we got the information, we reached there,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Pranitha was already raped by three men.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Shaheen's background I don't even know.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
We found her in a railway track,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
raped by many, many men, I don't know many.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
But the indications of that on her body was

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
that her intestine was outside her body.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And when we took her to the hospital

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
she needed 32 stitches to put back her intestine into her body.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
We still don't know who her parents are, who she is.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
All that we know that hundreds of men

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
had used her brutally.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Anjali's father, a drunkard,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
sold his child for pornography.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
You're seeing here images of

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
three years, four-year-olds, and five-year-old children

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
who have been trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
In this country, and across the globe,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
hundreds and thousands of children,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
as young as three, as young as four,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
are sold into sexual slavery.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
But that's not the only purpose that human beings are sold for.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
They are sold in the name of adoption.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
They are sold in the name of organ trade.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
They are sold in the name of forced labor,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
camel jockeying, anything, everything.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I work on the issue of commercial sexual exploitation.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And I tell you stories from there.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
My own journey to work with these children

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
started as a teenager.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I was 15 when I was gang-raped by eight men.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I don't remember the rape part of it so much

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
as much as the anger part of it.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Yes, there were eight men who defiled me, raped me,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
but that didn't go into my consciousness.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I never felt like a victim, then or now.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
But what lingered from then till now -- I am 40 today --

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
is this huge outrageous anger.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Two years, I was ostracized, I was stigmatized, I was isolated,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
because I was a victim.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And that's what we do to all traffic survivors.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
We, as a society, we have PhDs

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
in victimizing a victim.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Right from the age of 15,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
when I started looking around me,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
I started seeing hundreds and thousands of women and children

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
who are left in sexual slavery-like practices,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
but have absolutely no respite,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
because we don't allow them to come in.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Where does their journey begin?

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Most of them come from very optionless families,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
not just poor.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
You have even the middle class sometimes getting trafficked.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
I had this I.S. officer's daughter,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
who is 14 years old, studying in ninth standard,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
who was raped chatting with one individual,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and ran away from home because she wanted to become a heroine,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
who was trafficked.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000
I have hundreds and thousands of stories of very very well-to-do families,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
and children from well-to-do families,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
who are getting trafficked.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
These people are deceived, forced.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
99.9 percent of them

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
resist being inducted into prostitution.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Some pay the price for it.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
They're killed; we don't even hear about them.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
They are voiceless, [unclear],

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
nameless people.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
But the rest, who succumb into it,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
go through everyday torture.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Because the men who come to them are not men who want to make you your girlfriends,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
or who want to have a family with you.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
These are men who buy you for an hour, for a day,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
and use you, throw you.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Each of the girls that I have rescued --

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
I have rescued more than 3,200 girls --

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
each of them tell me one story in common ...

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
(Applause)

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
one story about one man, at least,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
putting chili powder in her vagina,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
one man taking a cigarette and burning her,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
one man whipping her.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
We are living among those men: they're our brothers, fathers,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
uncles, cousins, all around us.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
And we are silent about them.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
We think it is easy money.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
We think it is shortcut.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
We think the person likes to do what she's doing.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
But the extra bonuses that she gets

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
is various infections, sexually transmitted infections,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
HIV, AIDS, syphilis, gonorrhea, you name it,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
substance abuse, drugs, everything under the sun.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And one day she gives up on you and me,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
because we have no options for her.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And therefore she starts normalizing this exploitation.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
She believes, "Yes, this is it, this is what my destiny is about."

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And this is normal, to get raped by 100 men a day.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And it's abnormal to live in a shelter.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
It's abnormal to get rehabilitated.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
It's in that context that I work.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
It's in that context that I rescue children.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
I've rescued children as young as three years,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and I've rescued women as old as 40 years.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
When I rescued them, one of the biggest challenges I had

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
was where do I begin.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Because I had lots of them

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
who were already HIV infected.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
One third of the people I rescue

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
are HIV positive.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
And therefore my challenge was to

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
understand how can I get out

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
the power from this pain.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
And for me, I was my greatest experience.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Understanding my own self,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
understanding my own pain,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
my own isolation,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
was my greatest teacher.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Because what we did with these girls

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
is to understand their potential.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000
You see a girl here who is trained as a welder.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
She works for a very big company,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
a workshop in Hyderabad,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
making furnitures.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
She earns around 12,000 rupees.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
She is an illiterate girl,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
trained, skilled as a welder.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Why welding and why not computers?

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000
We felt, one of the things that these girls had

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
is immense amount of courage.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
They did not have any pardas inside their body,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
hijabs inside themselves;

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
they've crossed the barrier of it.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
And therefore they could fight in a male-dominated world,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
very easily, and not feel very shy about it.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
We have trained girls as carpenters,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
as masons,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
as security guards, as cab drivers.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
And each one of them are excelling

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
in their chosen field,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
gaining confidence, restoring dignity,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
and building hopes in their own lives.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
These girls are also working in big construction companies

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.000
like Ram-ki construction, as masons, full-time masons.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
What has been my challenge?

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
My challenge has not been the traffickers who beat me up.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
I've been beaten up more than 14 times in my life.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
I can't hear from my right ear.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
I've lost a staff of mine who was murdered

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
while on a rescue.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
My biggest challenge

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
is society.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
It's you and me.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
My biggest challenge is your blocks to accept these victims

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
as our own.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
A very supportive friend of mine,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
a well-wisher of mine,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
used to give me every month, 2,000 rupees for vegetables.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
When her mother fell sick she said,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
"Sunitha, you have so much of contacts.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Can you get somebody in my house to work,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
so that she can look after my mother?"

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
And there is a long pause.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
And then she says, "Not one of our girls."

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
It's very fashionable to talk about human trafficking,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
in this fantastic A-C hall.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
It's very nice for discussion, discourse,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
making films and everything.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
But it is not nice to bring them to our homes.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000
It's not nice to give them employment in our factories, our companies.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
It's not nice for our children to study with their children.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
There it ends.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
That's my biggest challenge.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
If I'm here today, I'm here not only as Sunitha Krishnan.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
I'm here as a voice of the victims and survivors of human trafficking.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
They need your compassion.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
They need your empathy.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
They need, much more than anything else,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
your acceptance.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Many times when I talk to people,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
I keep telling them one thing:

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
don't tell me hundred ways

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
how you cannot respond to this problem.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Can you ply your mind for that one way

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
that you can respond to the problem?

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
And that's what I'm here for,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
asking for your support,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
demanding for your support,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
requesting for your support.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Can you break your culture of silence?

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Can you speak to at least two persons about this story?

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Tell them this story. Convince them to tell the story to another two persons.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
I'm not asking you all to become Mahatma Gandhis

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
or Martin Luther Kings, or Medha Patkars,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
or something like that.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
I'm asking you, in your limited world,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
can you open your minds? Can you open your hearts?

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Can you just encompass these people too?

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Because they are also a part of us.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
They are also part of this world.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
I'm asking you, for these children,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
whose faces you see, they're no more.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
They died of AIDS last year.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
I'm asking you to help them,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
accept as human beings --

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
not as philanthropy, not as charity,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
but as human beings who deserve all our support.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
I'm asking you this because no child, no human being,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
deserves what these children have gone through.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Thank you.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:20.000
(Applause)
