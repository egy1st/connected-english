00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
For the last 20 years I've been designing puzzles.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And I'm here today to give you

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
a little tour, starting from the very first puzzle I designed,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
through what I'm doing now.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I've designed puzzles for books, printed things.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I'm the puzzle columnist for Discover Magazine.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I've been doing that for about 10 years.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I have a monthly puzzle calendar.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I do toys. The bulk of my work is in computer games.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I did puzzles for "Bejeweled."

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000
(Applause)

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I didn't invent "Bejeweled." I can't take credit for that.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So, very first puzzle,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
sixth grade, my teacher said,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
"Oh, let's see, that guy, he likes to make stuff.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I'll have him cut out letters out of construction paper

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
for the board."

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I thought this was a great assignment.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And so here is what I came up with. I start fiddling with it.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I came up with this letter. This is a letter of the alphabet

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
that's been folded just once.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
The question is, which letter is it if I unfold it?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
One hint: It's not "L."

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
(Laughter)

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
It could be an "L," of course.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So, what else could it be?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Yeah, a lot of you got it.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Oh yeah. So, clever thing.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Now, that was my first puzzle. I got hooked.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I created something new, I was very excited

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
because, you know, I'd made crossword puzzles,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
but that's sort of like filling in somebody else's matrix.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
This was something really original. I got hooked.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I read Martin Gardner's columns in Scientific American.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Went on, and eventually decided to devote myself, full time, to that.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Now, I should pause and say, what do I mean by puzzle?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
A puzzle is a problem that is fun to solve

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and has a right answer.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
"Fun to solve," as opposed to everyday problems,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
which, frankly, are not very well-designed puzzles.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
You know, they might have a solution.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
It might take a long time. Nobody wrote down the rules clearly.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Who designed this?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
It's like, you know, life is not a very well-written story

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
so we have to hire writers to make movies.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Well, I take everyday problems, and I make puzzles out of them.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And "right answer," of course there might be more than one right answer;

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
many puzzles have more than one.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
But as opposed to a couple other forms of play,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
toys and games --

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
by toy I mean, something you play with that doesn't have a particular goal.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
You can create one out of Legos.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
You know, you can do anything you want.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Or competitive games like chess where,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
well, you're not trying to solve ... You can make a chess puzzle,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
but the goal really is to beat another player.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
I consider that puzzles are an art form.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
They're very ancient. It goes back as long as there is written history.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
It's a very small form, like a joke,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
a poem, a magic trick or a song, very compact form.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
At worst, they're throwaways, they're for amusement.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
But at best they can reach for something more

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and create a memorable impression.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
The progression of my career that you'll see

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
is looking for creating puzzles that have a memorable impact.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
So, one thing I found early on, when I started doing computer games,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
is that I could create puzzles that will alter your perception.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
I'll show you how. Here is a famous one.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
So, it's two profiles in black, or a white vase in the middle.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
This is called a figure-ground illusion.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
The artist M.C. Escher exploited that

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
in some of his wonderful prints.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Here we have "Day and Night."

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Here is what I did with figure and ground.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
So, here we have "figure" in black.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Here we have "figure" in white.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And it's all part of the same design.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
The background to one is the other.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Originally I tried to do the words "figure" and "ground."

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
But I couldn't do that, I realized. I changed the problem.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
It's all "figure."

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
(Laughter)

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
A few other things. Here is my name.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
And that turns into the title of my first book, "Inversions."

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
These sorts of designs now go by the word "ambigram."

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
I'll show you just a couple others. Here we have

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
the numbers one through 10, the digits zero through nine, actually.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Each letter here is one of these digits.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Not strictly an ambigram in the conventional sense.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
I like pushing on what an ambigram can mean.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Here's the word "mirror." No, it's not the same upside-down.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
It's the same this way.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
And a marvelous fellow from the Media Lab

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
who just got appointed head of RISD, is John Maeda.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And so I did this for him. It's sort of a visual canon.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000
(Laughter)

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And recently in Magic magazine

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
I've done a number of ambigrams on magician's names.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
So here we have Penn and Teller, same upside-down.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
This appears in my puzzle calendar.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Okay, let's go back to the slides.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Thank you very much.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Now, those are fun to look at.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Now how would you do it interactively?

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
For a while I was an interface designer.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
And so I think a lot about interaction.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Well, let's first of all simplify the vases illusion,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
make the thing on the right.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Now, if you could pick up the black vase,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
it would look like the figure on top.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
If you could pick up the white area,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
it would look like the figure on the bottom.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Well, you can't do that physically,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
but on a computer you can do it. Let's switch over to the P.C.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
And here it is, figure-ground.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
The goal here is to take the pieces on the left

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
and make them so they look like the shape on the right.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And this follows the rules I just said:

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
any black area that is surrounded by white can be picked up.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
But that is also true of any white area.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
So, here we got the white area in the middle,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
and you can pick it up.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
I'll just go one step further.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
So, here is --

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
here is a couple pieces. Move them together,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
and now this is an active piece.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
You can really get inside somebody's perception

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
and have them experience something.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
It's like the old maxim of

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
"you can tell somebody something

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
and show them, but if they do it they really learn it."

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Here is another thing you can do.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
There is a game called Rush Hour.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
This is one of the true masterpieces in puzzle design

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
besides Rubik's cube.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
So, here we have a crowded parking lot

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
with cars all over the place.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
The goal is to get the red car out. It's a sliding block puzzle.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
It's made by the company Think Fun.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
It's done very well. I love this puzzle.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Well, let's play one. Here. So, here is a very simple puzzle.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Well, that's too simple, let's add another piece.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Okay, so how would you solve this one?

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Well, move the blue one out of the way.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Here, let's make it a little harder. Still pretty easy.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Now we'll make it harder, a little harder.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Now, this one is a little bit trickier.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
You know? What do you do here?

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
The first move is going to be what?

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
You're going to move the blue one up in order to get the lavender one to the right.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
And you can make puzzles like this one that aren't solvable at all.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Those four are locked in a pinwheel; you can't get them apart.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
I wanted to make a sequel.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
I didn't come up with the original idea. But this is another way

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
I work as an inventor is to create a sequel.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
I came up with this. This is Railroad Rush Hour.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
It's the same basic game except I introduced a new piece,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
a square piece that can move both horizontally and vertically.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
In the other game the cars can only move forward and back.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Created a whole bunch of levels for it.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Now I'm making it available to schools.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
And it includes exercises that show you

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
not just how to solve these puzzles,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
but how to extract the principles that will let you solve

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
mathematical puzzles or problems in science, other areas.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
So, I'm really interested in you learning how to make your own puzzles

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
as well as just me creating them.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Garry Trudeau calls himself an investigative cartoonist.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
You know, he does a lot of research before he writes a cartoon.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
In Discover Magazine, I'm an investigative puzzle maker.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
I got interested in gene sequencing.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
And I said, "Well, how on Earth can you come up with a sequence

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
of the base pairs in DNA?"

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Cut up the DNA, you sequence individual pieces,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
and then you look for overlaps,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
and you basically match them at the edges. And I said,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
"This is kind of like a jigsaw puzzle, except the pieces overlap."

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
So, here is what I created for Discover Magazine.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
And it has to be solvable in a magazine.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
You know, you can't cut out the pieces and move them around.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
So, here is the nine pieces. And you're supposed to put them into this grid.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
And you have to choose pieces that overlap on the edge.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
There is only one solution. It's not that hard.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
But it takes some persistence.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
And when you're done, it makes this design,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000
which, if you squint, is the word "helix."

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
So, that's the form of the puzzle coming out of the content,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
rather than the other way around.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Here is a couple more. Here is a physics-based puzzle.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Which way will these fall?

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
One of these weighs 50 pounds, 30 pounds and 10 pounds.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
And depending on which one weighs which amount,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
they'll fall different directions.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
And here is a puzzle based on color mixing.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
I separated this image into cyan, magenta, yellow, black,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
the basic printing colors, and then mixed up the separations,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
and you get these peculiar pictures.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Which separations were mixed up to make those pictures?

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Gets you thinking about color.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Finally, what I'm doing now. So, ShuffleBrain.com,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
website you can go visit, I joined up with my wife, Amy-Jo Kim.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
She could easily be up here giving a talk about her work.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
So, we're making smart games for social media.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
I'll explain what that means. We're looking at three trends.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
This is what's going on in the games industry right now.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
First of all, you know, for a long time

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
computer games meant things like "Doom,"

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
where you're going around shooting things, very violent games, very fast,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
aimed at teenage boys. Right? That's who plays computer games.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Well, guess what? That's changing.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
"Bejeweled" is a big hit. It was the game that really broke open

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
what's called casual games.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
And the main players are over 35, and are female.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Then recently "Rock Band" has been a big hit.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And it's a game you play with other people.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
It's very physical. It looks nothing like a traditional game.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
This is what's becoming the dominant form of electronic gaming.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Now, within that there is some interesting things happening.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
There is also a trend towards games that are good for you.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Why? Well, we aging Boomers,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Baby Boomers, we're eating our healthy food,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
we're exercising. What about our minds?

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Oh no, our parents are getting Alzheimer's. We better do something.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Turns out doing crossword puzzles can stave off some of the effects of Alzheimer's.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000
So, we got games like "Brain Age" coming out for the Nintendo DS, huge hit.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
A lot of people do Sudoku. In fact some doctors prescribe it.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
And then there is social media, and what's happening on the Internet.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Everybody now considers themselves a creator,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
and not just a viewer.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
And what does this add up to?

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Here is what we see coming.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
It's games that fit into a healthy lifestyle.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
They're part of your life. They're not necessarily a separate thing.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
And they are both, something that is good for you, and they're fun.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
I'm a puzzle guy. My wife is an expert in social media.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
And we decided to combine our skills.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Our first game is called "Photo Grab." The game takes about a minute and 20 seconds.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
This is your first time playing my game. Okay.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Let's see how well we can do. There are three images.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
And we have 24 seconds each.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Where is that?

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
I'll play as fast as I can.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
But if you can see it, shout out the answer.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
You get more -- Down, okay, yeah where is that?

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Oh, yeah. There, okay. J-O and --

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
I guess that's that part. We got the bow. That bow helps.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
That's his hair. You get a lot of figure-ground problems.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Yeah, that one is easy. Okay. So, ahhh! Okay on to the next one.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Okay, so that's the lens.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Anybody?

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Looks like a black shape. So, where is that?

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
That's the corner of the whole thing.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Yeah, I've played this image before,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
but even when I make up my own puzzles --

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
and you can put your own images in here.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
And we have people all over the world doing that now.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
There we are. Visit ShuffleBrain.com

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
if you want to try it yourself. Thank you.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
(Applause)
