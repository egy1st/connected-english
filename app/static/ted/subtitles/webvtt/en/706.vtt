00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Chris has been so nice.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I don't know how you keep it up, Chris, I really don't.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
So nice, all week. He's the kind of man you could say to,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
"Chris, I'm really sorry, I've crashed your car.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And it gets worse, I crashed it into your house.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Your house has caught fire.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And what's more, your wife has just run off with your best friend."

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And you know that Chris would say, "Thank you."

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
(Laughter)

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
"Thank you for sharing, that's really interesting."

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
(Laughter)

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
"Thank you for taking me to a place that I didn't know existed. Thank you."

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
(Laughter)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
One of the -- (Applause) Thank you for inviting us.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
One of the things about appearing later on in the TED week is that,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
gradually, as the days go by,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
all the other speakers cover most of what you were going to say.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
(Laughter)

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Nuclear fusion, I had about 10 minutes on that.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Spectroscopy, that was another one.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Parallel universes.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And so this morning I thought, "Oh well, I'll just do a card trick."

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
(Laughter)

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
That one's gone as well.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And today is Emmanuel's day, I think we've agreed that, already, haven't we?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Emmanuel? Absolutely. (Applause)

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I was planning on finishing on a dance ...

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000
(Laughter)

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So, that's going to look pretty shabby now.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So, what I thought I'd do is -- in honor of Emmanuel --

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
is, what I can do is to launch today the first

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
TED Global auction.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
If I could start, this is the Enigma decoding machine.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
(Laughter)

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Who will start me with $1,000? Anyone?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Thank you. Bruno's face, just then,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
he said, "No, don't go through this. Don't, please don't.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Don't go through this. Don't do it."

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
(Laughter)

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I'm worried. When I first got the invitation,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
they said somewhere in the thing, they said, "15 minutes to change the world,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
your moment onstage." 15 minutes to change the world.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I don't know about you, it takes me 15 minutes to change a plug.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000
(Laughter)

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So, the idea of changing the world is really quite an extraordinary one.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Well, of course now we know we don't have to change a plug,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
now we've seen that wonderful demonstration

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
of the wireless electric -- fantastic. You know, it inspires us.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
300 years ago he'd have been burnt at the stake for that.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
(Laughter)

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And now it's an idea.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
(Laughter)

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
It's great. It's fantastic.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
But you do meet some fantastic people,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
people who look at the world in a totally different way.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Yesterday, David Deutsch, another one

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
who covered most of what I was going to say.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
(Laughter)

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
But when you think of the world in that way,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
it does make going to Starbucks a whole new experience, don't you think?

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I mean, he must walk in and they will say,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
"Would you like a macchiato,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
or a latte, or an Americano,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
or a cappuccino?"

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And he'll say,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
"You're offering me things that are infinitely variable."

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
(Laughter)

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
"How can your coffee be true?"

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
(Laughter)

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And they will say,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
"Would you mind if I serve the next customer?"

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
(Laughter)

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And Elaine Morgan yesterday, wasn't she wonderful?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Fantastic. Really good.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Her talk about the aquatic ape, and the link, of course,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
the link between Darwinism

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and the fact that we are all naked beneath this --

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
we're not hirsute and we can swim rather well.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
And she said, you know, she's 90. She's running out of time, she said.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And she's desperate to find more evidence for the link.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And I think, "I'm sitting next to Lewis Pugh."

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
(Laughter)

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
This man has swum around the North Pole, what more evidence do you want?

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
(Laughter)

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And there he is.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000
(Applause)

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
That's how TED brings these connections together.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
I wasn't here on Tuesday. I didn't actually see Gordon Brown's

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
job application -- um, sorry.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000
(Laughter)

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
I'm so sorry. (Applause)

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
I'm so sorry. No, no. (Applause)

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
No, no, ahh ... (Applause)

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
(As Brown): "Global problems require Scottish solutions."

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
(Laughter)

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
The problem I have is because Gordon Brown, he comes onstage

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and he looks for all the world like a man

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
who's just taken the head off a bear suit.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
(As Brown): "Hello, can I tell you what happened in the woods back there?

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Uh, no." (Laughter)

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
"I'm sorry. I've only got 18 minutes, 18 minutes to talk about saving the world,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
saving the planet, global institutions.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Our work on climate change,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
I've only got 18 minutes, unfortunately I'm not able to tell you about

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
all the wonderful things we're doing to promote the climate change agenda

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
in Great Britain,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
like the third runway we're planning at Heathrow Airport ..."

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
(Laughter)

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
"The large coal-fired power station we're building

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
at King's North,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
and of course the exciting news that only today,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
only this week, Britain's only manufacturer

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
of wind turbines has been forced to close.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
No time, unfortunately,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
to mention those."

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
(Applause)

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
"British jobs for Scottish people ...

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
No." (Laughter)

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
"Christian principles, Christian values.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife."

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
(Laughter)

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
"Although to be honest, when I was at Number 11 that was never going to be a problem."

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
(Laughter)

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
(As Tony Blair): "Yeah, alright, come on, eh.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Alright Gordon, come on, eh.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
I just, can I just say a few things about,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
first about Cherie, because she's a wonderful lady,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
my wife, with a wonderful smile.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
That reminds me, I must post that letter."

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
(Laughter)

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
"I just think, you know, what people forget,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Gordon and I, we always got on perfectly well.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Alright, it was never exactly 'Brokeback Mountain.'"

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
(Laughter)

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
"You know, I wrote to him, just before I left office. I said,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
'Can I rely on your support for the next month?'

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And he wrote back. He said, 'No, you can't.'

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Which kind of surprised me, because I'd never seen 'can't' spelled that way before."

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
(Laughter)

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Another thing Gordon could have mentioned in his speech

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
to the Mansion House in 2002 --

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
that was to the building; the people weren't listening.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
But the people, when talking about the finance industry, he said,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.000
"What you as the city of London have done for financial services,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
we, as a government, hope to do for the economy as a whole."

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
(Laughter)

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
When you think what's happened to financial services,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
and you see what's happened to the economy, you think,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
"Well, there is a man who delivers on his promises."

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000
(Laughter)

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
But we're in a new world now. We're in a completely new world.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
This is the first time that I can remember, where if you get a letter

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
from the bank manager about a loan, you don't know if you're borrowing

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
money from him, or if he's borrowing money from you.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Am I right?

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
These extraordinary things, Icelandic Internet accounts.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Did anyone here have an Icelandic Internet account?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Why would you do that? Why would -- It's like one step up

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
from replying to one of those emails from Nigeria, isn't it?

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000
(Laughter)

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Asking for your bank details.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
And, you know, Iceland, it was never going to cut it.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
It didn't have that kind of collateral.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
What does it have? It has fish, that's all.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
That's why the Prime Minister went on television. He said,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
"This has left us all

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
with a very big haddock."

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
(Laughter)

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
A lot of what I do -- I have to try and make sense

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
of things before I can make nonsense of them.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
And making sense of the financial crisis is very, very difficult.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Luckily, somebody like George Bush was really helpful.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
He summed it up, really, at a dinner.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
He was speaking at a dinner, he said,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
"Wall Street got drunk."

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
(Laughter)

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
"And now it's got a hangover."

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
And that's, you know, that's something --

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
(Applause)

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
And that's something we can relate to.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
It's certainly something he can relate to.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
(Laughter)

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
And the other one, of course, is Donald Rumsfeld, who said,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
"There are the known knowns, the things we know we know.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
And then you got the known unknowns,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
the things we know we don't know.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
And then you got the unknown unknowns, those are the things

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
we don't know we don't know."

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
And being English, when I first heard that I thought, "What a load of cock."

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
And then, you're now, well, actually, that's what this is about.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
This whole, what Ben Bernanke has said,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
the chaotic unwinding of the world's financial system,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
it's about -- they don't know, they didn't know what they were doing.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
In 2006, the head of the American Mortgage Bankers Association said, quote,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
"As we can clearly see,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
no seismic occurrence

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
is about to overwhelm the U.S. economy."

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Now, there is a man on top of his job.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000
(Laughter)

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
And when the crisis was happening, the head of quantitative equities

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
at Lehman Brothers said,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
"Events which models predicted would happen

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
once every 10,000 years

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
happened every day for three days."

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
So, it's extraordinary. It's a new world that's very, very difficult to make sense of.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
But we have a new hope. We have a new man.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
America has now elected its first openly black President.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
(Laughter)

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Wonderful news.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Not only that, he's left-handed. Have you noticed this?

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
How many people here are left-handed?

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
You see, a lot of the people that I most admire,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
they're great artists, great designers, great thinkers,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
they're left-handed.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
And somebody said to me last night, you know, being left-handed,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
you have to learn to write without smudging the ink.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
And somebody was talking about metaphors on Monday.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
And I thought, what a wonderful metaphor, isn't it? An American President who

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
has to write without smudging the ink.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
You like that one? As opposed to you could see

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
George Bush, well, what's the metaphor there?

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
I think it would be something out of the aquatic ape thing, wouldn't it?

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
"Well, you know I'm sorry about that.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
I'm right-handed but I seem to have smudged that ink as well."

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
(Laughter)

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
But, you know, he's gone. Now he's gone.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
That's eight years of American History, eight minutes of my act,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
just gone like that.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
"You know, it's the end of an error [sic].

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
I happen to believe it was a great error.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
I know folks said to me they believe it was one of the greatest errors

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
in the history of the United States.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
But we proved them wrong in Iraq.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
They said there was no link between Iraq and Al Qaeda.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
There is now."

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000
(Laughter)

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
"But I have a message for the suicide bombers,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
for those people who've blown themselves up."

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
(Laughter)

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
"We're going to find you."

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000
(Laughter)

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
"We're going to make sure you don't do it again."

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000
(Laughter)

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
But now he's gone, and it's great to see one of the --

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
arguably one of the worst speech makers

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
in American history,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
now given way to one of the greatest, in Obama.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
You were there, maybe, on the night of his victory.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
And he spoke to the crowd in Chicago, he said,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000
"If there is anyone out there

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
who still doubts

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
that America is a place

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
where all things are possible ..."

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
I can't do the whole thing because it would take too long, it really would.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000
(Laughter)

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
But you get the picture. And then it goes to the inauguration.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
And he and the Chief Justice, they trip over each other,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
they get their words wrong and they screw the thing up.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
And there is George Bush sitting there going, "Heh heh heh heh ..."

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000
(Laughter)

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
"Not so easy is it? Heh heh heh."

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
(Laughter)

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
But the interesting thing is, Gordon Brown was talking about Cicero,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
who said, people would listen to a speech, they said, "Great speech."

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
And then they'd listen to Demosthenes,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
and they'd say, "Let's march."

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
And we all want to believe in President Obama.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
It's rather like that line in the film "As Good As it Gets."

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Do you remember that film with Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
and Helen Hunt says to Jack Nicholson, "What do you see in me?"

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
And Jack Nicholson just says,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
"You make me want to be a better man."

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
And you want a leader who inspires and challenges

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
and makes you want to be a better citizen. Right?

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
But at the moment, it's a Cicero thing.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
We like what Barack Obama says, but we don't do anything about it.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
So he comes over to this country, and he says,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
"We need

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
a big fiscal stimulus."

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
And everyone goes, "Great!" He leaves the country

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
and the French and the Germans go, "No, no, forget about that,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
absolutely not." Nothing happens. He goes to Strasburg.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
He says, "We need more boots on the ground in Afghanistan."

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
And everyone goes, "Great idea."

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
He leaves, people go, "No no no, we're not going to do that.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
5,000 maximum, and no rockets. No, no, not going to do it."

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
He goes to Prague, he says, "We believe in a nuclear-free world."

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
And it's great to have an American president who can say the word "nuclear,"

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
let's just point that out first.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Do you remember that? George Bush, "A nu-ca-ler."

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Sorry, what? "A nu-ca-ler."

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000
(Laughter)

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Could you say "avuncular"? "Avunclear."

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000
(Laughter)

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Thank you very much.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
But he says, "We want a nuclear-free world."

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
And that day, North Korea, that very day,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
North Korea is just seeing if it can

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
just get one over Japan --

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000
(Laughter) --

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
and land it before ...

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
So, where do we look for inspiration? We've still got Bill Clinton.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
"Travels the world." (Laughs)

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:30.000
"I believe, I believe it was President Dwight D. Eisenhower who said ..."

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000
(Laughter)

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
"Tell a lie; it was Diana Ross ..."

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000
(Laughter)

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
"... who said, reach out and touch ..."

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
(Laughter)

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
"... somebody's gla -- hand."

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
(Laughter)

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
"Make this world a better place, if you can.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
I just think that's important. I really do.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
And I was hoping Hillary would get to the White House,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
because she'd have been out of our home for four years.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
And I, you know." (Laughter)

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
"So, when that didn't work out I had to make a few arrangements, let me tell you."

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
(Laughter)

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
So, there's him. In Britain we have Prince Charles:

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
"And the environment is so important, all we can do.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
My wife gets fed up with me constantly trying to

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
push emissions up her agenda."

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
(Laughter)

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Or, any South Africans, we have Mandela to inspire.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Mandela, the great man Mandela.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
He's been honored with a statue now.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
The previous highest honor he had in Britain

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
was a visit from the team from Ground Force, a gardening program.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
"So, Nelson, how would you like a nice water feature?"

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
"Ahh, listen to me Mr. Titchmarsh."

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
(Laughter)

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.000
"I was held in prison

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
for nearly 30 years

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
on an island

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
in the middle of the ocean.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Why would I need a bloody water feature?"

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
(Laughter)

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Very quickly: I wasn't quite sure how to end this talk

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
and then yesterday that man came up with a wonderful quote

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
from the "Japanese Essays on Idleness"

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
which said it's nice to have something which is unfinished

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
because it implies there is still room for growth.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Thank you very much indeed.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:20.000
(Applause)
