00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The National Portrait Gallery is the place dedicated

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
to presenting great American lives,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
amazing people.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And that's what it's about.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We use portraiture as a way to deliver those lives, but that's it.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And so I'm not going to talk about the painted portrait today.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I'm going to talk about a program I started there,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
which, from my point of view, is the proudest thing I did.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I started to worry about the fact

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
that a lot of people don't get their portraits painted anymore,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and they're amazing people,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and we want to deliver them to future generations.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So, how do we do that?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And so I came up with the idea of the living self-portrait series.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And the living self-portrait series was the idea of basically

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
my being a brush in the hand

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
of amazing people who would come and I would interview.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And so what I'm going to do is, not so much give you

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
the great hits of that program,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
as to give you this whole notion

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
of how you encounter people in that kind of situation,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
what you try to find out about them,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and when people deliver and when they don't and why.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Now, I had two preconditions.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
One was that they be American.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
That's just because, in the nature of the National Portrait Gallery,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
it's created to look at American lives.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
That was easy, but then I made the decision,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
maybe arbitrary,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
that they needed to be people of a certain age,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
which at that point, when I created this program,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
seemed really old.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Sixties, seventies, eighties and nineties.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
For obvious reasons, it doesn't seem that old anymore to me.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And why did I do that?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Well, for one thing, we're a youth-obsessed culture.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And I thought really what we need is an elders program

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
to just sit at the feet of amazing people and hear them talk.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
But the second part of it -- and the older I get,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
the more convinced I am that that's true.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
It's amazing what people will say when they know

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
how the story turned out.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
That's the one advantage that older people have.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Well, they have other, little bit of advantage,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
but they also have some disadvantages,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
but the one thing they or we have is that

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
we've reached the point in life

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
where we know how the story turned out.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So, we can then go back in our lives,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
if we've got an interviewer who gets that,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and begin to reflect on how we got there.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
All of those accidents that wound up

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
creating the life narrative that we inherited.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
So, I thought okay, now,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
what is it going to take to make this work?

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
There are many kinds of interviews. We know them.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
There are the journalist interviews,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
which are the interrogation that is expected.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
This is somewhat against resistance

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and caginess on the part of the interviewee.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Then there's the celebrity interview,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
where it's more important who's asking the question than who answers.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
That's Barbara Walters and others like that, and we like that.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
That's Frost-Nixon, where Frost seems to be as important

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
as Nixon in that process.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Fair enough.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
But I wanted interviews that were different.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.000
I wanted to be, as I later thought of it, empathic,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
which is to say, to feel what they wanted to say

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
and to be an agent of their self-revelation.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
By the way, this was always done in public.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
This was not an oral history program.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
This was all about 300 people sitting at the feet of this individual,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
and having me be the brush in their self-portrait.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Now, it turns out that I was pretty good at that.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
I didn't know it coming into it.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And the only reason I really know that

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
is because of one interview I did with Senator William Fulbright,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
and that was six months after he'd had a stroke.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And he had never appeared in public since that point.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
This was not a devastating stroke,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
but it did affect his speaking and so forth.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And I thought it was worth a chance,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
he thought it was worth a chance,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
and so we got up on the stage,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
and we had an hour conversation about his life,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
and after that a woman rushed up to me,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
essentially did,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
and she said, "Where did you train as a doctor?"

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
And I said, "I have no training as a doctor. I never claimed that."

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
And she said, "Well, something very weird was happening.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
When he started a sentence, particularly

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
in the early parts of the interview,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
and paused, you gave him the word,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
the bridge to get to the end of the sentence,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and by the end of it,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
he was speaking complete sentences on his own."

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
I didn't know what was going on,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
but I was so part of the process of getting that out.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
So I thought, okay, fine, I've got empathy,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
or empathy, at any rate,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
is what's critical to this kind of interview.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
But then I began to think of other things.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Who makes a great interview in this context?

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
It had nothing to do with their intellect,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
the quality of their intellect.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Some of them were very brilliant,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
some of them were,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
you know, ordinary people who would never claim to be intellectuals,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
but it was never about that.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
It was about their energy.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
It's energy that creates extraordinary interviews

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
and extraordinary lives.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
I'm convinced of it.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
And it had nothing to do with the energy of being young.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
These were people through their 90s.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
In fact, the first person I interviewed

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
was George Abbott, who was 97,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
and Abbott was filled with the life force --

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
I guess that's the way I think about it -- filled with it.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
And so he filled the room,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and we had an extraordinary conversation.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
He was supposed to be the toughest interview that anybody would ever do

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
because he was famous for being silent,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
for never ever saying anything

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
except maybe a word or two.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And, in fact, he did wind up opening up --

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
by the way, his energy is evidenced in other ways.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
He subsequently got married again at 102,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
so he, you know, he had a lot of the life force in him.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
But after the interview, I got a call,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
very gruff voice, from a woman.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
I didn't know who she was,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
and she said, "Did you get George Abbott to talk?"

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And I said, "Yeah. Apparently I did."

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
And she said, "I'm his old girlfriend, Maureen Stapleton,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
and I could never do it."

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
And then she made me go up with the tape of it

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
and prove that George Abbott actually could talk.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
So, you know, you want energy,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
you want the life force,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
but you really want them also to think

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
that they have a story worth sharing.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
The worst interviews that you can ever have

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
are with people who are modest.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Never ever get up on a stage with somebody who's modest,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
because all of these people have been assembled

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
to listen to them, and they sit there and they say,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
"Aw, shucks, it was an accident."

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
There's nothing that ever happens that justifies

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
people taking good hours of the day to be with them.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
The worst interview I ever did: William L. Shirer.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
The journalist who did "The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich."

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
This guy had met Hitler and Gandhi within six months,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
and every time I'd ask him about it, he'd say, "Oh, I just happened to be there.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Didn't matter." Whatever.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Awful.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
I never would ever agree to interview a modest person.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
They have to think that they did something

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
and that they want to share it with you.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
But it comes down, in the end,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:46.000
to how do you get through all the barriers we have.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
All of us are public and private beings,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000
and if all you're going to get from the interviewee is their public self,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
there's no point in it.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
It's pre-programmed. It's infomercial,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
and we all have infomercials about our lives.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
We know the great lines, we know the great moments,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
we know what we're not going to share,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
and the point of this was not to embarrass anybody.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
This wasn't -- and some of you will remember

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Mike Wallace's old interviews --

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
tough, aggressive and so forth. They have their place.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
I was trying to get them to say what they probably wanted to say,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.000
to break out of their own cocoon of the public self,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
and the more public they had been,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000
the more entrenched that person, that outer person was.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
And let me tell you at once the worse moment and the best moment

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
that happened in this interview series.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:46.000
It all has to do with that shell that most of us have,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
and particularly certain people.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
There's an extraordinary woman named Clare Boothe Luce.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
It'll be your generational determinant

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
as to whether her name means much to you.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
She did so much. She was a playwright.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
She did an extraordinary play called "The Women."

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
She was a congresswoman

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
when there weren't very many congresswomen.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
She was editor of Vanity Fair,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
one of the great phenomenal women of her day.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
And, incidentally, I call her

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
the Eleanor Roosevelt of the Right.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
She was sort of adored on the Right

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
the way Eleanor Roosevelt was on the Left.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
And, in fact, when we did the interview --

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
I did the living self-portrait with her --

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
there were three former directors of the CIA

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
basically sitting at her feet,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
just enjoying her presence.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
And I thought, this is going to be a piece of cake,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
because I always have preliminary talks with these people

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
for just maybe 10 or 15 minutes.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
We never talk before that because if you talk before,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
you don't get it on the stage.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
So she and I had a delightful conversation.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
We were on the stage and then --

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
by the way, spectacular.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
It was all part of Clare Boothe Luce's look.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
She was in a great evening gown.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
She was 80, almost that day of the interview,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
and there she was and there I was,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
and I just proceeded into the questions.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
And she stonewalled me. It was unbelievable.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Anything that I would ask, she would turn around, dismiss,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
and I was basically up there -- any of you

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
in the moderate-to-full entertainment world

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
know what it is to die onstage.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
And I was dying. She was absolutely not giving me a thing.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
And I began to wonder what was going on,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
and you think while you talk,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
and basically, I thought, I got it.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
When we were alone, I was her audience.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Now I'm her competitor for the audience.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
That's the problem here, and she's fighting me for that,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
and so then I asked her a question --

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
I didn't know how I was going to get out of it --

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000
I asked her a question about her days as a playwright,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
and again, characteristically,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
instead of saying, "Oh yes, I was a playwright, and this is what blah blah blah,"

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
she said, "Oh, playwright. Everybody knows I was a playwright.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Most people think that I was an actress. I was never an actress."

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
But I hadn't asked that, and then she went off on a tear,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
and she said, "Oh, well, there was that one time that I was an actress.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
It was for a charity in Connecticut when I was a congresswoman,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
and I got up there," and she went on and on, "And then I got on the stage."

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
And then she turned to me and said,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
"And you know what those young actors did?

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
They upstaged me." And she said, "Do you know what that is?"

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Just withering in her contempt.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
And I said, "I'm learning."

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
(Laughter)

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000
And she looked at me, and it was like the successful arm-wrestle,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
and then, after that, she delivered an extraordinary account

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
of what her life really was like.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
I have to end that one. This is my tribute to Clare Boothe Luce.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Again, a remarkable person.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
I'm not politically attracted to her, but through her life force,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
I'm attracted to her.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000
And the way she died -- she had, toward the end, a brain tumor.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
That's probably as terrible a way to die as you can imagine,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:19.000
and very few of us were invited to a dinner party.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
And she was in horrible pain.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
We all knew that.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
She stayed in her room.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Everybody came. The butler passed around canapes.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
The usual sort of thing.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Then at a certain moment, the door opened

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
and she walked out perfectly dressed, completely composed.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
The public self, the beauty, the intellect,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
and she walked around and talked to every person there

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
and then went back into the room and was never seen again.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.000
She wanted the control of her final moment, and she did it amazingly.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Now, there are other ways that you get somebody to open up,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
and this is just a brief reference.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
It wasn't this arm-wrestle,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
but it was a little surprising for the person involved.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
I interviewed Steve Martin. It wasn't all that long ago.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
And we were sitting there,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
and almost toward the beginning of the interview,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
I turned to him and I said, "Steve," or "Mr. Martin,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:27.000
it is said that all comedians have unhappy childhoods.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Was yours unhappy?"

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
And he looked at me, you know, as if to say,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
"This is how you're going to start this thing, right off?"

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
And then he turned to me, not stupidly,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
and he said, "What was your childhood like?"

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
And I said -- these are all arm wrestles, but they're affectionate --

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
and I said, "My father was loving and supportive,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
which is why I'm not funny."

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
(Laughter)

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
And he looked at me, and then we heard the big sad story.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
His father was an SOB,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
and, in fact, he was another comedian with an unhappy childhood,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
but then we were off and running.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000
So the question is:

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
What is the key that's going to allow this to proceed?

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Now, these are arm wrestle questions,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
but I want to tell you about questions

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
that are more related to empathy

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
and that really, very often, are the questions

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
that people have been waiting their whole lives to be asked.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
And I'll just give you two examples of this because of the time constraints.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:32.000
One was an interview I did with one of the great American biographers.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Again, some of you will know him, most of you won't, Dumas Malone.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
He did a five-volume biography of Thomas Jefferson,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
spent virtually his whole life with Thomas Jefferson,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
and by the way, at one point I asked him,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
"Would you like to have met him?"

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
And he said, "Well, of course,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
but actually, I know him better than anyone who ever met him,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
because I got to read all of his letters."

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.000
So, he was very satisfied with the kind of relationship they had over 50 years.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
And I asked him one question.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
I said, "Did Jefferson ever disappoint you?"

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000
And here is this man who had given his whole life to uncovering Jefferson

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
and connecting with him,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000
and he said, "Well ..." -- I'm going to do a bad southern accent.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
Dumas Malone was from Mississippi originally.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
But he said, "Well," he said, "I'm afraid so."

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
He said, "You know, I've read everything,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:37.000
and sometimes Mr. Jefferson would smooth the truth a bit."

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
And he basically was saying that this was a man

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
who lied more than he wished he had,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
because he saw the letters.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
He said, "But I understand that." He said, "I understand that."

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
He said, "We southerners do like a smooth surface,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
so that there were times when he just didn't want the confrontation."

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
And he said, "Now, John Adams was too honest."

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
And he started to talk about that, and later on he invited me to his house,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
and I met his wife who was from Massachusetts,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
and he and she had exactly the relationship

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
of Thomas Jefferson and John Adams.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
She was the New Englander and abrasive,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
and he was this courtly fellow.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
But really the most important question I ever asked,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
and most of the times when I talk about it,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000
people kind of suck in their breath at my audacity, or cruelty,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
but I promise you it was the right question.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
This was to Agnes de Mille.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Agnes de Mille is one of the great choreographers in our history.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
She basically created the dances in "Oklahoma,"

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
transforming the American theater.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
An amazing woman.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000
At the time that I proposed to her that --

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
by the way, I would have proposed to her; she was extraordinary --

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
but proposed to her that she come on.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
She said, "Come to my apartment."

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
She lived in New York.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
"Come to my apartment and we'll talk for those 15 minutes,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
and then we'll decide whether we proceed."

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000
And so I showed up in this dark, rambling New York apartment,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
and she called out to me, and she was in bed.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
I had known that she had had a stroke,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
and that was some 10 years before.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000
And so she spent almost all of her life in bed,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
but -- I speak of the life force --

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
her hair was askew.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
She wasn't about to make up for this occasion.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
And she was sitting there surrounded by books,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
and her most interesting possession she felt at that moment

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:44.000
was her will, which she had by her side.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
She wasn't unhappy about this. She was resigned.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:54.000
She said, "I keep this will by my bed, memento mori,

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
and I change it all the time

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
just because I want to."

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000
And she was loving the prospect of death as much as she had loved life.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
I thought, this is somebody I've got to get in this series.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
She agreed.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
She came on. Of course she was wheelchaired on.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Half of her body was stricken, the other half not.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
She was, of course, done up for the occasion,

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
but this was a woman in great physical distress.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
And we had a conversation,

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
and then I asked her this unthinkable question.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:37.000
I said, "Was it a problem for you in your life that you were not beautiful?"

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000
And the audience just -- you know,

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
they're always on the side of the interviewee,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
and they felt that this was a kind of assault,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
but this was the question she had

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
wanted somebody to ask her whole life.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000
And she began to talk about her childhood, when she was beautiful,

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
and she literally turned -- here she was, in this broken body --

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000
and she turned to the audience and

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
described herself as the fair demoiselle

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:10.000
with her red hair and her light steps and so forth,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
and then she said, "And then puberty hit."

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
And she began to talk about things that had happened

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
to her body and her face,

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000
and how she could no longer count on her beauty,

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:28.000
and her family then treated her like the ugly sister of the beautiful one

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
for whom all the ballet lessons were given.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000
And she had to go along just to be with her sister for company,

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
and in that process, she made a number of decisions.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
First of all, was that dance, even though

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
it hadn't been offered to her, was her life.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
And secondly, she had better be,

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
although she did dance for a while, a choreographer

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
because then her looks didn't matter.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:56.000
But she was thrilled to get that out as a real, real fact in her life.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000
It was an amazing privilege to do this series.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:07.000
There were other moments like that, very few moments of silence.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
The key point was empathy

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
because everybody in their lives

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000
is really waiting for people to ask them questions,

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
so that they can be truthful about who they are

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
and how they became what they are,

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000
and I commend that to you, even if you're not doing interviews.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
Just be that way with your friends

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000
and particularly the older members of your family.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
Thank you very much.
