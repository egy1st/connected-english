WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Good morning.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I've come here to share with you an experiment

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
of how to get rid of one form of human suffering.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
It really is a story of Dr. Venkataswamy.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
His mission and his message is about the Aravind Eye Care System.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I think first it's important for us to recognize what it is to be blind.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
(Music)

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Woman: Everywhere I went looking for work, they said no,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
what use do we have for a blind woman?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I couldn't thread a needle or see the lice in my hair.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
If an ant fell into my rice, I couldn't see that either.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Thulasiraj Ravilla: Becoming blind is a big part of it,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
but I think it also deprives the person of their livelihood, their dignity,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
their independence, and their status in the family.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So she is just one amongst the millions who are blind.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And the irony is that they don't need to be.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
A simple, well-proven surgery can restore sight to millions,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and something even simpler, a pair of glasses, can make millions more see.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
If we add to that the many of us here now

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
who are more productive because they have a pair of glasses,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
then almost one in five Indians will require eye care,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
a staggering 200 million people.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Today, we're reaching not even 10 percent of them.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
So this is the context in which Aravind came into existence

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
about 30 years back

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
as a post-retirement project of Dr. V.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
He started this with no money.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
He had to mortgage all his life savings

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
to make a bank loan.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And over time, we have grown into a network of five hospitals,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
predominately in the state of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and then we added several, what we call Vision Centers

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
as a hub-and-spoke model.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And then more recently we started managing hospitals

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
in other parts of the country

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and also setting up hospitals in other parts of the world as well.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
The last three decades,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
we have done about three-and-a-half million surgeries,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
a vast majority of them for the poor people.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Now, each year we perform about 300,000 surgeries.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
A typical day at Aravind, we would do about a thousand surgeries,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
maybe see about 6,000 patients,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
send out teams into the villages to examine, bring back patients,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
lots of telemedicine consultations,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and, on top of that, do a lot of training,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.000
both for doctors and technicians who will become the future staff of Aravind.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And then doing this day-in and day-out, and doing it well,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
requires a lot of inspiration and a lot of hard work.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And I think this was possible thanks to the building blocks

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
put in place by Dr. V.,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
a value system, an efficient delivery process,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and fostering the culture of innovation.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.000
(Music)

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Dr. V: I used to sit with the ordinary village man because I am from a village,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
and suddenly you turn around and seem to be in contact with his inner being,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
you seem to be one with him.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Here is a soul which has got all the simplicity of confidence.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Doctor, whatever you say, I accept it.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
An implicit faith in you

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
and then you respond to it.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Here is an old lady who has got so much faith in me, I must do my best for her.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
When we grow in spiritual consciousness,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
we identify ourselves with all that is in the world,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
so there is no exploitation.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
It is ourselves we are helping.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
It is ourselves we are healing.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
(Applause)

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000
This helped us build a very ethical and very highly patient-centric organization

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
and systems that support it.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000
But on a practical level, you also have to deliver services efficiently,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
and, odd as it may seem, the inspiration came from McDonald's.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Dr. V: See, McDonald's' concept is simple.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:38.000
They feel they can train people all over the world,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
irrespective of different religions, cultures, all those things,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
to produce a product in the same way

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
and deliver it in the same manner

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
in hundreds of places.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Larry Brilliant: He kept talking about McDonalds and hamburgers,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000
and none of it made any sense to us.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
He wanted to create a franchise,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
a mechanism of delivery of eye care

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
with the efficiency of McDonald's.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Dr. V: Supposing I'm able to produce eye care,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
techniques, methods, all in the same way,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
and make it available in every corner of the world.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
The problem of blindness is gone.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
TR: If you think about it, I think the eyeball is the same,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
as American or African,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
the problem is the same, the treatment is the same.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
And yet, why should there be so much variation in quality and in service,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
and that was the fundamental principle that we followed

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
when we designed the delivery systems.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And, of course, the challenge was that it's a huge problem,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
we are talking of millions of people,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
very little resource to deal with it,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and then lots of logistics and affordability issues.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
And then so, one had to constantly innovate.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
And one of the early innovations, which still continues,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
is to create ownership in the community to the problem,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
and then engage with them as a partner,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
and here is one such event.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Here a community camp just organized

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
by the community themselves,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
where they find a place, organize volunteers,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
and then we'll do our part. You know, check their vision,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
and then you have doctors who you find out what the problem is

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
and then determine what further testing should be done,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000
and then those tests are done by technicians

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
who check for glasses,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
or check for glaucoma.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
And then, with all these results, the doctor makes a final diagnosis,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
and then prescribes a line of treatment,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
and if they need a pair of glasses, they are available right there at the camp site,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
usually under a tree.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
But they get glasses in the frames of their choice,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
and that's very important because I think glasses,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
in addition to helping people see,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
is also a fashion statement, and they're willing to pay for it.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
So they get it in about 20 minutes

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
and those who require surgery, are counseled,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
and then there are buses waiting,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
which will transport them to the base hospital.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000
And if it was not for this kind of logistics and support,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
many people like this would probably never get services,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
and certainly not when they most need it.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
They receive surgery the following day,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
and then they will stay for a day or two,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
and then they are put back on the buses

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
to be taken back to where they came from,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
and where their families will be waiting to take them back home.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.000
(Applause)

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
And this happens several thousand times each year.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
It may sound impressive that we're seeing lots of patients,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
very efficient process,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
but we looked at, are we solving the problem?

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
We did a study, a scientifically designed process,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
and then, to our dismay,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
we found this was only reaching seven percent of those in need,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
and we're not adequately addressing more, bigger problems.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
So we had to do something different,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000
so we set up what we call primary eye care centers, vision centers.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
These are truly paperless offices

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
with completely electronic medical records and so on.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
They receive comprehensive eye exams.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
We kind of changed the simple digital camera into a retinal camera,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
and then every patient gets their teleconsultation with a doctor.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
The effect of this has been that, within the first year,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
we really had a 40 percent penetration in the market that it served,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
which is over 50,000 people.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
And the second year went up to 75 percent.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
So I think we have a process by which

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
we can really penetrate into the market

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
and reach everyone who needs it,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
and in this process of using technology, make sure

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
that most don't need to come to the base hospital.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
And how much will they pay for this?

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
We fixed the pricing, taking into account

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
what they would save in bus fare in coming to a city,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
so they pay about 20 rupees, and that's good for three consultations.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
(Applause)

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
The other challenge was, how do you give high-tech

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
or more advanced treatment and care?

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
We designed a van with a VSAT,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
which sends out images of patients to the base hospital

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
where it is diagnosed,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
and then as the patient is waiting, the report goes back to the patient,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
it gets printed out, the patient gets it,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
and then gets a consultation about what they should be doing --

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
I mean, go see a doctor or come back after six months,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
and then this happens as a way of

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
bridging the technology competence.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
So the impact of all this has been essentially one of growing the market,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
because it focused on the non-customer,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
and then by reaching the unreached,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
we're able to significantly grow the market.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
The other aspect is how do you deal with this efficiently

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
when you have very few ophthalmologists?

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
So what is in this video is a surgeon operating,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
and then you see on the other side,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
another patient is getting ready.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
So, as they finish the surgery,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
they just swing the microscope over,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
the tables are placed so that their distance is just right,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
and then we need to do this, because, by doing this kind of process,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000
we're able to more than quadruple the productivity of the surgeon.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
And then to support the surgeon,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
we require a certain workforce.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
And then we focused on village girls that we recruited,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
and then they really are the backbone of the organization.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
They do almost all of the skill-based routine tasks.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
They do one thing at a time. They do it extremely well.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
With the result we have very high productivity,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
very high quality at very, very low cost.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
So, putting all this together, what really happened was

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
the productivity of our staff was

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
significantly higher than anyone else.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.000
(Applause)

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
This is a very busy table,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
but what this really is conveying is that,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
when it comes to quality, we have put in

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
very good quality-assurance systems.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
As a result, our complications are significantly lower

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
than what has been reported in the United Kingdom,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
and you don't see those kind of numbers very often.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
(Applause)

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
So the final part of the puzzle is,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
how do you make all this work financially,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
especially when the people can't pay for it?

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
So what we did was, we gave away a lot of it for free,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
and then those who pay, I mean, they paid local market rates,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
nothing more, and often much less.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And we were helped by the market inefficiency.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
I think that has been a big savior, even now.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
And, of course, one needs the mindset to be wanting to give away

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
what you have as a surplus.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
The result has been, over the years,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
the expenditure has increased with volumes.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
The revenues increase at a higher level,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
giving us a healthy margin

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
while you're treating a large number of people for free.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
I think in absolute terms,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
last year we earned about 20-odd million dollars,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000
spent about 13 million, with over a 40 percent EBITA.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:51.000
(Applause)

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
But this really requires going beyond what we do,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
or what we have done,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
if you really want to achieve solving this problem of blindness.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
And what we did was a couple of very counter-intuitive things.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
We created competition for ourselves,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
and then we made eye care affordable

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
by making low-cost consumables.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
We proactively and systematically

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
promoted these practices to many hospitals in India,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
many in our own backyards and then in other parts of the world as well.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
The impact of this has been that these hospitals,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
in the second year after our consultation,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
are double their output

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000
and then achieve financial recovery as well.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
The other part was how do you address

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
this increase in cost of technology?

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
There was a time when we failed to negotiate

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
the [intra-ocular lens] prices to be at affordable levels,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
so we set up a manufacturing unit.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
And then, over time, we were able to bring down the cost significantly

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000
to about two percent of what it used to be when we started out.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Today, we believe we have about seven percent of the global market,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
and they're used in about 120-odd countries.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
To conclude, I mean, what we do, does it have a broader relevance,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000
or is it just India or developing countries?

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:27.000
So to address this, we studied UK versus Aravind.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
What it shows is that we do roughly about 60 percent

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
of the volume of what the UK does,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
near a half-million surgeries as a whole country.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
And we do about 300,000.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
And then we train about 50 ophthalmologists

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
against the 70 trained by them,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
comparable quality, both in training and in patient care.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
So we're really comparing apples to apples.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
We looked at cost.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
(Laughter)

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:02.000
(Applause)

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
So, I think it is simple to say

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
just because the U.K. isn't India the difference is happening.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
I think there is more to it.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
I mean, I think one has to look at other aspects as well.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Maybe there is --

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
the solution to the cost could be in productivity,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
maybe in efficiency, in the clinical process,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
or in how much they pay for the lenses or consumables,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
or regulations, their defensive practice.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
So, I think decoding this can probably bring

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000
answers to most developed countries

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
including the U.S., and maybe

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Obama's ratings can go up again.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
(Laughter)

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Another insight, which, again, I want to leave with you,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
in conditions where the problem is very large,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
which cuts across all economic strata,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
where we have a good solution,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
I think the process I described,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
you know, productivity, quality, patient-centered care,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
can give an answer,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
and there are many which fit this paradigm.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
You take dentistry, hearing aid, maternity and so on.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
There are many where this paradigm can now play,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
but I think probably one of the most challenging things

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
is on the softer side.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Now, how do you create compassion?

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Now, how do you make people own the problem,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
want to do something about it?

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
There are a bit harder issues.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
And I'm sure people in this crowd can probably find the solutions to these.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
So I want to end my talk leaving this thought and challenge to you.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Dr. V: When you grow in spiritual consciousness,

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
we identify with all that is in the world

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
so there is no exploitation.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
It is ourselves we are helping.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
It is ourselves we are healing.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
TR: Thank you very much.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:17:05.000
(Applause)
