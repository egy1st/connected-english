00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hello, everyone. Because this is my first time at TED,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I've decided to bring along an old friend

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
to help break the ice a bit.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Yes. That's right. This is Barbie.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
She's 50 years old. And she's looking as young as ever.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
(Laughter)

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
But I'd also like to introduce you to

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
what may be an unfamiliar face.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
This is Fulla. Fulla is the Arab world's answer to Barbie.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Now, according to proponents of the clash of civilizations,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Barbie and Fulla occupy these completely separate spheres.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
They have different interests. They have divergent values.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And should they ever come in contact ...

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
well, I've got to tell you, it's just not going to be pretty.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
My experience, however, in the Islamic world is very different.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Where I work, in the Arab region,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
people are busy taking up Western innovations

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and changing them into things

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
which are neither conventionally Western,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
nor are they traditionally Islamic.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I want to show you two examples.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
The first is 4Shbab.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
It means "for youth" and it's a new Arab TV channel.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
(Video): Video clips from across the globe.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
The USA.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
♫ I am not afraid to stand alone ♫

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
♫ I am not afraid to stand alone, if Allah is by my side ♫

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
♫ I am not afraid to stand alone ♫

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
♫ Everything will be all right ♫

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
♫ I am not afraid to stand alone ♫

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The Arab world.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:45.000
(Music)

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
♫ She was preserved by modesty of the religion ♫

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
♫ She was adorned by the light of the Quran ♫

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Shereen El Feki: 4Shbab has been dubbed Islamic MTV.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Its creator, who is an Egyptian TV producer

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
called Ahmed Abu Haïba,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
wants young people to be inspired

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
by Islam to lead better lives.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
He reckons the best way to get that message across

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
is to use the enormously popular medium of music videos.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
4Shbab was set up as an alternative

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
to existing Arab music channels.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And they look something like this.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
(Music)

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
That, by the way is Haifa Wehbe. She's a Lebanese pop star

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and pan-Arab pin-up girl.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
In the world of 4Shbab, it's not about bump and grind.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
But it's not about fire and brimstone either.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Its videos are intended to show

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
a kinder, gentler face of Islam,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
for young people to deal with life's challenges.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Now, my second example is for a slightly younger crowd.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And it's called "The 99."

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Now, these are the world's first Islamic superheroes.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
They were created by a Kuwaiti psychologist

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
called Naif Al Mutawa.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
And his desire is to rescue Islam

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
from images of intolerance,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
all in a child-friendly format.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
"The 99." The characters are meant to embody

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
the 99 attributes of Allah:

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
justice, wisdom, mercy, among others.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
So, for example, there is the character of Noora.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
She is meant to have the power

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
to look inside people

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and see the good and bad in everyone.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Another character called Jami

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
has the ability to create fantastic inventions.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Now, "The 99" is not just a comic book.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
It's now a theme park.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
There is an animated series in the works.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And by this time next year,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
the likes of Superman and Wonder Woman

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
will have joined forces with "The 99"

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000
to beat injustice wherever they find it.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
"The 99" and 4Shbab are just two of many examples

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
of this sort of Islamic cross-cultural hybridization.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
We're not talking here about a clash of civilizations.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Nor is it some sort of indistinguishable mash.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
I like to think of it as a mesh of civilizations,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
in which the strands of different cultures are intertwined.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Now, while 4Shbab and "The 99" may look new and shiny,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
there is actually a very long tradition of this.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Throughout its history, Islam has borrowed and adapted from other civilizations

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
both ancient and modern.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
After all, it's the Quran which encourages us to do this:

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
"We made you into nations and tribes

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
so that you could learn from one another."

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
And to my mind, those are pretty wise words,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
no matter what your creed. Thank you.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000
(Applause)
