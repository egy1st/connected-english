00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm going to show you how terrorism

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
actually interacts with our daily life.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
15 years ago I received a phone call from a friend.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
At the time he was looking after the rights of political prisoners

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
in Italian jails.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
He asked me if I wanted to interview the Red Brigades.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Now, as many of you may remember,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
the Red Brigades was a terrorist, Marxist organization

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
which was very active in Italy

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
from the 1960s until the mid-1980s.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
As part of their strategy

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
the Red Brigades never spoke with anybody, not even with their lawyers.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
They sat in silence through their trails,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
waving occasionally at family and friends.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
In 1993 they declared the end of the armed struggle.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And they drew a list of people with whom they would talk,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and tell their story.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And I was one of those people.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
When I asked my friend why the Red Brigades want to talk to me,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
he said that the female members of the organization

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
had actually supported my name.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
In particular, one person had put it forward.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
She was my childhood friend.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
She had joined the Red Brigades

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and became a leader of the organization.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Naturally, I didn't know that

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
until the day she was arrested.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
In fact, I read it in the newspaper.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
At the time of the phone call

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I just had a baby,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I successfully completed a management buyout

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
to the company I was working with,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and the last thing I wanted to do was to go back home

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and touring the high-security prisons.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
But this is exactly what I did

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
because I wanted to know

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
what had turned my best friend

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
into a terrorist,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and why she'd never tried to recruit me.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
(Laughter)

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
(Applause)

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
So, this is exactly what I did.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Now, I found the answer very quickly.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I actually had failed

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
the psychological profiling of a terrorist.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
The center committee of the Red Brigades

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
had judged me too single-minded

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and too opinionated to become a good terrorist.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
My friend, on the other hand, she was a good terrorist

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
because she was very good at following orders.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
She also embraced violence.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Because she believed that the only way

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
to unblock what, at the time,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
was known as a blocked democracy,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Italy, a country run by the same party for 35 years

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
was the arms struggle.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
At the same time, while I was interviewing the Red Brigades,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I also discovered that their life was not ruled

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
by politics or ideology,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
but actually was ruled by economics.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
They were constantly short of cash.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
They were constantly searching for cash.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Now, contrary to what many people believe,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
terrorism is actually a very expensive business.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
I'll give you an idea.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
In the 1970s, the turnover of the Red Brigades

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
on a yearly basis

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
was seven million dollars.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
This is roughly between 100

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
and 150 million, today.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Now, you know, if you live underground

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
it's really hard to produce this amount of money.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
But this also explains why, when I was interviewing the Red Brigades,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
and then, later on, other arms organizations,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
including members of al-Zarqawi group in the Middle East,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
everybody was extremely reluctant

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
to talk about ideology, or politics.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Because they had no idea.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
The political vision of a terrorist organization

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
is decided by the leadership,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
which, generally, is never more than five to seven people.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
All the others do, day in and day out,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
is search for money.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Once, for example, I was interviewing

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
this part-timer from the Red Brigades.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
It was a psychiatrist. He loved sailing.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
He was a really keen sailor. And he had this beautiful boat.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
And he told me that the best time of his life

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
was when he was a member of the Red Brigades

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
and he went sailing, every summer, back and forth

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
from Lebanon, where he would pick up

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Soviet weapons from the PLO,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
and then carry them all the way to Sardinia

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
where the other arms organization from Europe would go

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
and take their share of the arms.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
For that service the Red Brigades were actually paid a fee,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
which went to fund their organization.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
So, because I am a trained economist

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
and I think in economic terms,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
all of the sudden I thought,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
maybe there is something here.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Maybe there is a link, a commercial link,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
between one organization and another one.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
But it was only when I interviewed

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Mario Moretti, the head of the Red Brigades,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
the man who kidnapped and killed Aldo Moro,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Italian former prime minister,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
that I finally realized

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
that terrorism is actually business.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
I was having lunch with him

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
in a high-security prison in Italy.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And as we were eating,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
I had the distinct feeling

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
that I was back in the city of London,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
having lunch with a fellow banker or an economist.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
This guy thought in the same way I did.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000
So, I decided that I wanted to investigate the economics of terrorism.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Naturally, nobody wanted to fund my research.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
In fact, I think many people thought that I was a bit crazy.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
You know, that woman that goes around to foundations

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
asking for money, thinking about the economics of terrorism.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
So, in the end, I took a decision

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
that, in retrospect, did change my life.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
I sold my company,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
and funded the research myself.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And what I discovered

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
is this parallel reality,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
another international economic system,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
which runs parallel to our own,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
which has been created by arms organizations

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
since the end of World War II.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
And what is even more shocking

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
is that this system

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
has followed, step by step, the evolution

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
of our own system,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
of our Western capitalism.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
And there are three main stages.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
The first one is the state sponsor of terrorism.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
The second one is the privatization of terrorism.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And the third, of course, is the globalization of terrorism.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
So, state sponsor of terrorism,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
feature of the Cold War.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
This is when the two superpowers were fighting

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
a war by proxy,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
along the periphery of the sphere of influence,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
fully funding arms organizations.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
A mix of legal and illegal activities is used.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
So, the link between crime and terror

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
is established very early on.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
And here is the best example,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
the Contras in Nicaragua, created by the CIA,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
legally funded by the U.S. Congress,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
illegally funded by the Reagan administration

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.000
via covert operation, for example, the Iran-Contra Affair.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Then comes the late 1970s, early '80s,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
and some groups successfully carry out

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
the privatization of terrorism.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
So, they gain independence from the sponsor,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
and start funding themselves.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Now, again we see a mix of legal and illegal activities.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
So, Arafat used to get a percentage

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
of the smuggling of hashish

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
from Bekáa Valley, which is the valley between Lebanon and Syria.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
And the IRA, which control the private transportation system

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
in Northern Ireland, did exactly the same thing.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
So, every single time

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
that somebody got into a taxi in Belfast

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
without knowing, actually,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
was funding the IRA.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
But the great change came, of course,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
with globalization and deregulation.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
This is when arms organization were able to link up,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
also financially, with each other.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
But above all, they started to do

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
serious business with the world of crime.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
And together they money-laundered

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
their dirty business through the same channel.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
This is when we see the birth of the transnational

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
arms organization Al Qaeda.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
This is an organization that can raise money across border.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
But also that is able to carry out attacks

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
in more than one country.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Now, deregulation also brought back

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
rogue economics.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
So what is rogue economics?

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Rogue economics is a force which is constantly

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
lurking in the background of history.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
It comes back at times of great transformation,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
globalization being one of those transformations.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
It is at this times in which

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
politics actually loses control of the economy,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
and the economy becomes a rogue force

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
working against us.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000
It has happened before in history.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
It has happened with the fall of the Roman Empire.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
It has happened with Industrial Revolution.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:37.000
And it actually happened again, with the fall of the Berlin wall.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Now, I calculated how big was this international

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
economic system composed by crime,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
terror, and illegal economy,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
before 9-11.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.000
And it is a staggering 1.5 trillion dollars.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
It is trillions, it's not billions.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
This is about twice the GDP of the United Kingdom,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
soon will be more,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
considering where this country is going.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
(Laughter)

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Now, until 9-11,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
the bulk of all this money

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
flew into the U.S. economy

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
because the bulk of the money was denominated in U.S. dollars

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
and the money laundering was taking place

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
inside the United States.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
The entry point, of course, of most of this money

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
were the off-shore facilities.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
So, this was a vital injection of cash

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
into the U.S. economy.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Now, when I went to look at the figures of the U.S. money supply,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
the U.S. money supply is the amount

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
of dollars that the Federal Reserve

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
prints every year

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
in order to satisfy

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
the increase in the demand for dollars,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
which, of course, reflects the growth

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
of the economy.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
So, when I went to look at those figures, I noted that since the late 1960s

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
a growing number of these dollars

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
was actually leaving the United States,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
never to come back.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
These were money taken out

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
in suitcases or in containers, in cash of course.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
These were money taken out by criminals and money launderers.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
These were money taken out to fund

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
the growth of the terror,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
illegal and criminal economy.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
So, you see, what is the relationship?

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
The United States actually is a country

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
that is the reserve currency of the world.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
What does it mean? That means that

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
it has a privilege that other countries do not have.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
It can borrow against the total amount of dollars

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
in circulation in the world.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
This privilege is called seigniorage.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
No other country can do that.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
All the other countries, for example the United Kingdom,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
can borrow only against the amount of money

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
in circulation inside its own borders.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
So, here is the implication of the relationship

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
between the worlds of crime, terror, and illegal economy, and our economy.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
The U.S. in the 1990s

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
was borrowing against the growth

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
of the terror, illegal and criminal economy.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
This is how close we are with this world.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Now, this situation changed, of course, after 9-11,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
because George Bush launched the War on Terror.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Part of the War on Terror

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
was the introduction of the Patriot Act.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Now, many of you know that the Patriot Act

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
is a legislation that greatly reduces

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
the liberties of Americans in order to protect them

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
against terrorism.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
But there is a section of the Patriot Act

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
which refers specifically to finance.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
And it is, in fact, an anti-money-laundering legislation.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
What the Patriot Act did was

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
to prohibit U.S. bank,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
and U.S.-registered foreign banks

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
from doing any businesses with off-shore facilities.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
It closed that door between the money laundering

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
in dollars, and the U.S. economy.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000
It also gave the U.S. monetary authorities

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
the right to monitor any dollar transaction

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
taking place anywhere in the world.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Now, you can imagine what was the reaction of the international

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
finance and banking.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
All the bankers said to their clients,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
"Get out of the dollars and go and invest somewhere else."

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Now, the Euro was a newly born currency

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
of great opportunity for business, and, of course, for investment.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
And this is what people did.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
Nobody wants the U.S. monetary authority

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
to check their relationship,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000
to monitor their relationship with their clientele.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
The same thing happened, of course,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
in the world of crime and terror.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.000
People simply moved their money-laundering activities

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
away from the United States

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
into Europe.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Why did this happen? This happened because

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
the Patriot Act was a unilateral legislation.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
It was introduced only in the United States.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
And it was introduced only for the U.S. dollars.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
In Europe, a similar legislation

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
was not introduced.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
So, within six months

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Europe became the epicenter

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
of the money-laundering activities

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
of the world.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
So, this is how incredible are the relationship

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
between the world of crime

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
and the world of terror,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
and our own life.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
So, why did I tell you this story?

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
I told you this story because you

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
must understand that there is a world

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
that goes well beyond the headlines of the newspapers,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
including the personal relationship that you have

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
with friends and family.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
You got to question everything that is told to you,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
including what I just told you today.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
(Laughter)

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
This is the only way for you

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
to step into the dark side, and have a look at it.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
And believe me,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
it's going to be scary.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
It's going to be frightful, but it's going to enlighten you.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
And, above all, it's not going to be boring.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
(Laughter)

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
(Applause)
