00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
My name is Ryan Lobo,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
and I've been involved in the documentary

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
filmmaking business all over the world for the last 10 years.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
During the process of making these films

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I found myself taking photographs,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
often much to the annoyance of the video cameramen.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I found this photography of mine almost compulsive.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And at the end of a shoot, I would sometimes feel that

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I had photographs that told a better story

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
than a sometimes-sensational documentary.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I felt, when I had my photographs,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
that I was holding on to something true,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
regardless of agendas or politics.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
In 2007, I traveled to three war zones.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I traveled to Iraq, Afghanistan and Liberia.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And over there I experienced

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
other people's suffering, up close and personal,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
immersed myself in some rather intense and emotional stories,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and at times I experienced great fear for my own life.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
As always, I would return to Bangalore,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and often to animated discussions at friend's homes,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
where we would discuss various issues

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
while they complained bitterly about the new pub timings,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
where a drink often cost more than what they'd paid

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
their 14-year-old maid.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I would feel very isolated during these discussions.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
But at the same time, I questioned myself

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and my own integrity and purpose in storytelling.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And I decided that I had compromised,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
just like my friends in those discussions,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
where we told stories

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
in contexts we made excuses for,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
rather than taking responsibility for.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I won't go into details about what led to a decision I made,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
but let's just say it involved alcohol, cigarettes,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
other substances and a woman.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
(Laughter)

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I basically decided that it was I,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
not the camera or the network,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
or anything that lay outside myself,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
that was the only instrument in storytelling

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
truly worth tuning.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
In my life, when I tried to achieve things

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
like success or recognition, they eluded me.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Paradoxically, when I let go of these objectives,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and worked from a place of compassion and purpose,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
looking for excellence, rather than the results of it,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
everything arrived on its own, including fulfillment.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Photography transcended culture, including my own.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And it is, for me, a language which expressed the intangible,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
and gives voice to people and stories without.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I invite you into three recent stories of mine,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
which are about this way of looking, if you will,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
which I believe exemplify the tenets

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
of what I like to call compassion in storytelling.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
In 2007 I went to Liberia,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
where a group of my friends and I

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
did an independent, self-funded film, still in progress,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
on a very legendary and brutal war-lord

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
named General Butt Naked.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
His real name is Joshua, and he's pictured here in a cell

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
where he once used to torture and murder people,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
including children.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Joshua claims to have personally killed

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
more than 10,000 people during Liberia's civil war.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
He got his name from fighting stark naked.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
And he is probably the most prolific mass murderer

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
alive on Earth today.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
This woman witnessed the General murdering her brother.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Joshua commanded his child-soldiers to commit unspeakable crimes,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
and enforced his command with great brutality.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Today many of these children are addicted to drugs like heroin,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and they are destitute, like these young men in the image.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
How do you live with yourself

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
if you know you've committed horrific crimes?

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Today the General is a baptized Christian evangelist.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
And he's on a mission.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
We accompanied Joshua, as he walked the Earth,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
visiting villages where he had once killed and raped.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
He seeked forgiveness,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and he claims to endeavor to improve

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
the lives of his child-soldiers.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
During this expedition I expected him

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
to be killed outright, and us as well.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
But what I saw opened my eyes

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
to an idea of forgiveness

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
which I never thought possible.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
In the midst of incredible poverty and loss,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
people who had nothing absolved a man

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
who had taken everything from them.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
He begs for forgiveness,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and receives it from the same woman

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
whose brother he murdered.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Senegalese, the young man seated on the wheelchair here,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
was once a child soldier, under the General's command,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
until he disobeyed orders,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
and the General shot off both his legs.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
He forgives the General in this image.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
He risked his life as he walked up to people

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
whose families he'd murdered.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
In this photograph a hostile crowd in a slum surrounds him.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
And Joshua remains silent

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
as they vented their rage against him.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
This image, to me, is almost like from a Shakespearean play,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
with a man, surrounded by various influences,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000
desperate to hold on to something true within himself,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
in a context of great suffering that he has created himself.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
I was intensely moved during all this.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
But the question is,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
does forgiveness and redemption replace justice?

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Joshua, in his own words, says that he does not mind

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
standing trial for his crimes,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
and speaks about them from soapboxes across Monrovia,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
to an audience that often includes his victims.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
A very unlikely spokesperson for the idea of

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
separation of church and state.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
The second story I'm going to tell you about

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
is about a group of very special fighting women

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
with rather unique peace-keeping skills.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Liberia has been devastated by one of Africa's

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
bloodiest civil wars,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
which has left more than 200,000 people dead,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
thousands of women scarred by rape and crime

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
on a spectacular scale.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Liberia is now home

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
to an all-woman United Nations contingent

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
of Indian peacekeepers.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
These women, many from small towns in India,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
help keep the peace, far away from home and family.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
They use negotiation and tolerance

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
more often than an armed response.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
The commander told me that a woman could gauge

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
a potentially violent situation

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
much better than men.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
And that they were definitely capable of diffusing it non-aggressively.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
This man was very drunk,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
and he was very interested in my camera,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
until he noticed the women, who handled him

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
with smiles, and AK-47s at the ready, of course.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000
(Laughter)

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
This contingent seems to be quite lucky,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
and it has not sustained any casualties,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
even though dozens of peacekeepers have been killed in Liberia.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And yes, all of those people killed were male.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Many of the women are married with children,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
and they say the hardest part of their deployment

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
was being kept away from their children.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
I accompanied these women on their patrols,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
and watched as they walked past men,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
many who passed very lewd comments incessantly.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And when I asked one of the women about the shock and awe response,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
she said, "Don't worry, same thing back home.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
We know how to deal with these fellows,"

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
and ignored them.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
In a country ravaged by violence against women,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Indian peacekeepers have inspired many local women

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
to join the police force.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Sometimes, when the war is over and all the film crews have left,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
the most inspiring stories are the ones

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
that float just beneath the radar.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
I came back to India and nobody was interested in buying the story.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
And one editor told me that she wasn't interested

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.000
in doing what she called "manual labor stories."

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
In 2007 and 2009 I did stories on the Delhi Fire Service, the DFS,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
which, during the summer, is probably the world's most active fire department.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
They answer more than 5,000 calls in just two months.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And all this against incredible logistical odds,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
like heat and traffic jams.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Something amazing happened during this shoot.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Due to a traffic jam, we were late in getting to a slum,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
a large slum, which had caught fire.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
As we neared, angry crowds attacked our trucks

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
and stoned them, by hundreds of people all over the place.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
These men were terrified,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
as the mob attacked our vehicle.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
But nonetheless, despite the hostility,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
firefighters left the vehicle and successfully fought the fire.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Running the gauntlet through hostile crowds,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
and some wearing motorbike helmets to prevent injury.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Some of the local people forcibly took away the hoses

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
from the firemen to put out the fire in their homes.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Now, hundreds of homes were destroyed.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
But the question that lingered in my mind was,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
what causes people to destroy fire trucks

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
headed to their own homes?

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Where does such rage come from?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
And how are we responsible for this?

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
45 percent of the 14 million people

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
who live in Delhi live in unauthorized slums,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
which are chronically overcrowded.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
They lack even the most basic amenities.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And this is something that is common to all our big cities.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Back to the DFS. A huge chemical depot caught fire,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
thousands of drums filled with petrochemicals

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
were blazing away and exploding all around us.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
The heat was so intense, that hoses were used

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
to cool down firefighters

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
fighting extremely close to the fire, and with no protective clothing.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
In India we often love to complain about our government bodies.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
But over here, the heads of the DFS,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Mr. R.C. Sharman, Mr. A.K. Sharman,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
led the firefight with their men.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Something wonderful in a country where

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
manual labor is often looked down upon.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
(Applause)

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Over the years, my faith in the power of storytelling has been tested.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
And I've had very serious doubt about its efficacy,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
and my own faith in humanity.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
However, a film we shot still airs on the National Geographic channel.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
And when it airs I get calls from all the guys I was with

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
and they tell me that they receive hundreds of calls congratulating them.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Some of the firemen told me that they were also inspired

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
to do better because they were so pleased

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
to get thank-yous rather than brick bats.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
It seems that this story helped change perceptions about the DFS,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
at least in the minds of an audience in part on televisions,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
read magazines and whose huts aren't on fire.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Sometimes, focusing on what's heroic, beautiful and dignified,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
regardless of the context,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
can help magnify these intangibles three ways,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
in the protagonist of the story, in the audience,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
and also in the storyteller.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
And that's the power of storytelling.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Focus on what's dignified, courageous and beautiful,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
and it grows. Thank you.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:59.000
(Applause)
