00:00:01.316 --> 00:00:04.269
There are a lot of web 2.0 consultants
who make a lot of money.

00:00:04.293 --> 00:00:06.467
In fact, they make
their living on this stuff.

00:00:06.491 --> 00:00:08.899
I'm going to try to save you
all the time and money

00:00:08.923 --> 00:00:11.781
and go through it in the next
three minutes, so bear with me.

00:00:11.805 --> 00:00:14.975
Started a website in 2005
with a few friends, called Reddit.com.

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:17.035
It's what you'd call
a social news website;

00:00:17.059 --> 00:00:20.313
basically, the democratic front page
of the best stuff on the web.

00:00:20.337 --> 00:00:24.199
You find some interesting content --
say, a TED Talk -- submit it to Reddit,

00:00:24.223 --> 00:00:27.788
and a community of your peers votes up
if they like it, down if they don't.

00:00:27.812 --> 00:00:29.149
That creates the front page.

00:00:29.173 --> 00:00:32.330
It's always rising, falling;
a half million people visit every day.

00:00:32.354 --> 00:00:33.691
But this isn't about Reddit.

00:00:33.715 --> 00:00:36.416
It's about discovering new things
that pop up on the web.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.984
In the last four years,
we've seen all kinds of memes,

00:00:39.008 --> 00:00:41.633
all kinds of trends get born
right on our front page.

00:00:41.657 --> 00:00:44.873
This isn't about Reddit itself,
it's actually about humpback whales.

00:00:44.897 --> 00:00:48.577
Well, technically, it's about Greenpeace,
an environmental organization

00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:51.685
that wanted to stop the Japanese
government's whaling campaign.

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:54.778
The whales were getting killed;
they wanted to put an end to it.

00:00:54.802 --> 00:00:56.555
One of the ways they wanted to do it

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.067
was to put a tracking chip
inside one of the whales.

00:00:59.091 --> 00:01:01.709
But to personify the movement,
they wanted to name it.

00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:04.052
So in true web fashion,
they put together a poll,

00:01:04.076 --> 00:01:07.500
where they had a bunch of very erudite,
very thoughtful, cultured names.

00:01:07.524 --> 00:01:09.778
I believe this is the Farsi word
for "immortal."

00:01:09.802 --> 00:01:13.836
I think this means "divine power
of the ocean" in a Polynesian language.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.690
And then there was this:
"Mister Splashy Pants."

00:01:16.714 --> 00:01:17.948
(Laughter)

00:01:17.972 --> 00:01:19.337
And this was a special name.

00:01:19.361 --> 00:01:23.034
Mister Pants, or "Splashy" to his friends,
was very popular on the Internet.

00:01:23.058 --> 00:01:24.806
In fact, someone on Reddit thought,

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.144
"What a great thing,
we should all vote this up."

00:01:27.168 --> 00:01:29.571
And Redditors responded and all agreed.

00:01:29.595 --> 00:01:30.884
So the voting started.

00:01:30.908 --> 00:01:33.778
We got behind it ourselves;
we changed our logo for the day,

00:01:33.802 --> 00:01:36.372
from the alien to Splashy,
to help the cause.

00:01:36.396 --> 00:01:39.388
And it wasn't long before other sites
like Fark and Boing Boing

00:01:39.412 --> 00:01:42.689
and the rest of the Internet started
saying, "We love Splashy Pants!"

00:01:42.713 --> 00:01:46.358
So it went from about five percent,
which was when this meme started,

00:01:46.382 --> 00:01:48.976
to 70 percent at the end of voting.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.386
Pretty impressive, right?
We won! Mister Splashy Pants was chosen.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.436
Just kidding -- Greenpeace
actually wasn't that crazy about it,

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.286
because they wanted one
of the more thoughtful names to win.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.517
They said, "No, just kidding.
We'll give it another week of voting."

00:02:01.541 --> 00:02:04.976
Well, that got us a little angry,
so we changed it to Fightin' Splashy.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.001
(Laughter)

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:08.913
And the Reddit community --
really, the rest of the Internet,

00:02:08.937 --> 00:02:10.088
really got behind this.

00:02:10.112 --> 00:02:11.511
Facebook groups were created.

00:02:11.535 --> 00:02:13.233
Facebook applications were created.

00:02:13.257 --> 00:02:16.479
The idea was, "Vote your conscience,
vote for Mister Splashy Pants."

00:02:16.503 --> 00:02:19.549
People were putting up signs
in the real world about this whale.

00:02:19.573 --> 00:02:20.574
(Laughter)

00:02:20.598 --> 00:02:23.359
This was the final vote:
78 percent of the votes.

00:02:23.383 --> 00:02:27.380
To give you an idea of the landslide,
the next highest name pulled in three.

00:02:27.404 --> 00:02:30.541
There was a clear lesson:
the Internet loves Mister Splashy Pants.

00:02:30.565 --> 00:02:32.303
Which is obvious. It's a great name.

00:02:32.327 --> 00:02:35.579
Everyone wants to hear their news
anchor say, "Mister Splashy Pants."

00:02:35.603 --> 00:02:36.604
(Laughter)

00:02:36.628 --> 00:02:38.457
I think that's what helped drive this.

00:02:38.481 --> 00:02:40.361
What was cool were the repercussions.

00:02:40.385 --> 00:02:43.266
Greenpeace created an entire
marketing campaign around it --

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.083
Mister Splashy Pants shirts and pins,

00:02:45.107 --> 00:02:47.828
an e-card so you could send
your friend a dancing Splashy.

00:02:47.852 --> 00:02:51.116
But even more important
was that they accomplished their mission.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.972
The Japanese government
called off their whaling expedition.

00:02:53.996 --> 00:02:56.163
Mission accomplished:
Greenpeace was thrilled,

00:02:56.187 --> 00:02:58.096
the whales were happy -- that's a quote.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.121
(Laughter)

00:02:59.145 --> 00:03:02.294
And actually, Redditors
in the Internet community

00:03:02.318 --> 00:03:04.998
were happy to participate,
but they weren't whale lovers.

00:03:05.022 --> 00:03:07.749
A few, certainly, but we're talking
about a lot of people,

00:03:07.773 --> 00:03:09.888
really interested
and caught up in this meme.

00:03:09.912 --> 00:03:13.412
Greenpeace came back to the site
and thanked Reddit for its participation.

00:03:13.436 --> 00:03:17.043
But this wasn't really altruism;
just interest in doing something cool.

00:03:17.067 --> 00:03:19.983
This is how the Internet works.
This is that great big secret.

00:03:20.007 --> 00:03:22.067
The Internet provides
a level playing field.

00:03:22.091 --> 00:03:25.055
Your link is as good as your link,
which is as good as my link.

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:28.277
With a browser, anyone can get
to any website no matter your budget.

00:03:28.301 --> 00:03:30.971
That is, as long as you can
keep net neutrality in place.

00:03:30.995 --> 00:03:34.093
Another important thing is it costs
nothing to get content online.

00:03:34.117 --> 00:03:36.215
There are so many
publishing tools available,

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.537
it only takes a few minutes
to produce something.

00:03:38.561 --> 00:03:41.241
and the cost of iteration
is so cheap, you might as well.

00:03:41.265 --> 00:03:43.278
If you do, be genuine.
Be honest, up-front.

00:03:43.302 --> 00:03:45.321
One of the great lessons
Greenpeace learned

00:03:45.345 --> 00:03:47.169
is that it's OK to lose control,

00:03:47.193 --> 00:03:49.261
OK to take yourself
a little less seriously,

00:03:49.285 --> 00:03:51.638
given that, even though
it's a very serious cause,

00:03:51.662 --> 00:03:53.574
you could ultimately achieve your goal.

00:03:53.598 --> 00:03:56.773
That's the final message I want to share:
you can do well online.

00:03:56.797 --> 00:03:59.715
But no longer is the message
coming from just the top down.

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.580
If you want to succeed you've got
to be OK to lose control.

00:04:02.604 --> 00:04:04.010
Thank you.

00:04:04.034 --> 00:04:06.034
(Applause)
