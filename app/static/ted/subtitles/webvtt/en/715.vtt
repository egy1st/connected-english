WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Actually, I come from Britain,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
but I've been living in Maldives for 26 years now.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So, that's home really.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The Maldives, as I'm sure you're aware, are a chain of islands

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
off the southwest coast of India here.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Capital, Malé, where I live.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Actually, sitting here today in Mysore,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
we're closer to Malé than we are to Delhi, for example.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
If you're in IT, India, obviously, is the place to be at the moment.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
But if you're a marine biologist, Maldives is not such a bad place to be.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And it has been my home these years.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
For those of you who've been there, fantastic coral reefs,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
fantastic diving, fantastic snorkeling.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I spend as much of my time as possible

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
investigating the marine life.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I study fish,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
also the bigger things, whales and dolphins.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
This is a blue whale. We have blue whales

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
in the waters around here, off Maldives,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
around the waters of India. You can see them off Kerala.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And, in fact, we're very lucky in this region.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
One of the best places in the world to see blue whales

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
is here in this region.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
In Sri Lanka, if you go down to the south coast of Sri Lanka,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
during the northeast monsoon season,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
you can see blue whales very, very easily.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
It's probably the best place in the world to see them.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Now, when I talk about the northeast monsoon season,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I'm sure many of you here know exactly what I mean,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
but perhaps some of you are not quite so sure.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I need to explain a little bit about monsoons.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Now, monsoon, the root of the word "monsoon"

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
comes from the word "season."

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So, it's just a season. And there are two seasons in most of South Asia.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And in the summer India heats up, gets very hot.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Hot air rises, and air is drawn in off the sea to replace it.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And the way it works is, it comes from the southwest.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
It comes off the ocean here and is drawn up towards India.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So it comes from the southwest. It's a southwest monsoon.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Picks up moisture as it crosses the ocean.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
That's what brings the monsoon rain.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And then in the winter things cool down.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
High pressure builds over India.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And the whole system goes into reverse.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
So, the wind is now coming from the northeast

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
out of India, across the Indian Ocean,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
this way towards Africa.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Keep that in mind.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Now, I'm a marine biologist, but I'm actually

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
a bit of an old fashioned naturalist, I suppose.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I'm interested in all sorts of things, almost everything that moves,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
including dragonflies. And I'm actually

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
going to talk, this afternoon, about dragonflies.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
This is a very beautiful species, it's called the Oriental Scarlet.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And one thing you need to know about dragonflies,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
one important thing,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
is that they lay their eggs in fresh water.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
They need fresh water to breed.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
They lay the eggs into fresh water.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Little larvae hatch out in fresh water.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
They feed on other little things. They feed on mosquito larvae.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
So, they're very important.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
They control mosquito larvae, among other things.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And they grow and grow by stages. And they climb out

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
of the water, burst out, as the adult which we see.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And typically, there is a lot of variation,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
but if you have a dragonfly with, say, a one year life cycle,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
which is quite typical, the larva, living in the fresh water,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
lives for 10 or 11 months.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And then the adult, which comes after, lives for one or two months.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So it's essentially a freshwater animal.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
It really does need fresh water.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Now, the particular species of dragonfly

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I want to talk about is this one,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
because most dragonflies, like the one we've just seen,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
when the adult is there for its brief one or two months of life,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
it doesn't go very far. It can't travel very far.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
A few kilometers, maybe, is quite typical.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
They are very good fliers, but they don't go too far.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
But this guy is an exception.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
And this is called the Globe Skimmer,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
or Wandering Glider.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And, as the name might suggest, it is found pretty much around the world.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
It lives throughout the tropics, the Americas,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Africa, Asia, Australia, into the Pacific.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And it wanders far and wide. We know that much about it.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
But it really hasn't been studied very much.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
It's a rather mediocre looking dragonfly.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
If you're going to study dragonflies, you want to study those really bright beautiful ones,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
like that red one. Or the really rare ones, the endemic endangered ones.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
This is, it seems a bit dull you know.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
It's sort of dull-colored. And it's fairly common.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And it occurs everywhere -- you know, why bother?

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
But if you take that attitude, you're actually missing something rather special.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Because this dragonfly has a rather amazing story to tell.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And I feel very privileged to have stumbled across it

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
living in the Maldives.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
When I first went to the Maldives,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
dead keen on diving, spent as much of my time

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
as I could in and under the water.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Didn't notice any dragonflies; maybe they were there, maybe they weren't.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Didn't notice them.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
But after some time, after some months, one day

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
as I was going out and about,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
suddenly I noticed hundreds of dragonflies, hundreds of dragonflies.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Something like this, these are all this species Globe Skimmer.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
I didn't know at the time, but I know now,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
they're Globe Skimmers, hundreds of them.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
And they were there for some time. And then they were gone.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And I didn't think anything more of it until

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
the following year, when it happened again,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and then the year after that, and then the year after that.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And I was a bit slow, I didn't really take too much notice.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
But I asked some Maldivian friends and colleagues, and yes they come every year.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
And I asked people about them and yes,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
they knew, but they didn't know anything,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
where they came from, or anything.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
And again I didn't think too much of it.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
But slowly it began to dawn on me that something

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
rather special was happening.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Because dragonflies need fresh water to breed.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And the Maldives, and I'm sure some of you have been there --

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
so here is home.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
So, Maldives, beautiful place.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
(Laughter)

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
It's built entirely of coral reefs.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
And on top of the coral reefs are sand banks.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Average height, about that much above sea level.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
So, global warming, sea level rise, it's a real serious issue.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
But I'm not going to talk about that.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Another important point of these sand banks

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
is that when it rains,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
the rainwater soaks down into the soil. So, it's gone.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
So, it stays under the soil.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
The trees can put their roots into it.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Humans can dig holes and make a well.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
But dragonflies -- a bit tricky.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
There is no surface fresh water.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
There are no ponds, streams, rivers, lakes,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
nothing like that.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
So, why is it that every year

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
millions of dragonflies, millions,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
millions of dragonflies turn up?

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
I got a little bit curious. In fact I'll stop here,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
because I want to ask, and there is a lot of people who,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
from India of course, people who grew up spending your childhood here.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Those of you who are Indian or spent your childhood here,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
let me have a show of hands, who of you --

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
not yet, not yet!

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
You're too keen. You're too keen. No. Hang on. Hang on.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Wait for the go. I'll say go.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Those of you who grew up in India,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
do you remember in your childhood, dragonflies,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
swarms of dragonflies? Maybe at school,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
maybe tying little bits of string onto them?

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Maybe pulling bits off? I'm not asking about that.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
You've only got to say, do you remember seeing lots of dragonflies.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Any hands? Any hands? Yes. Thank you. Thank you.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
It's a widespread phenomenon

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
throughout South Asia, including the Maldives.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
And I got a bit curious about it.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
In the Maldives -- now, in India there is plenty of water,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
so, dragonflies, yeah, of course. Why not?

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
But in Maldives, no fresh water. So, what on Earth is going on?

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
And the first thing I did was started recording

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
when they turned up in the Maldives.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
And there is the answer, 21st of October.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Not every year, that's the average date.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
So, I've been writing it down for 15 years now.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
You'd think they're coming from India. It's the closest place.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
But in October, remember, we're still in southwest monsoon,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Maldives is still in the southwest monsoon.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
But wind is, invariably, every time, is from the west.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
It's going towards India, not from India.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
So, are these things, how are these things getting here?

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Are they coming from India against the wind?

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Seemed a bit unlikely.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
So, next thing I did is I got on the phone.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Maldives is a long archipelago.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
It stretches about 500 miles, of course it's India here.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
I got on the phone and emailed to friends and colleagues.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
When do you see the dragonflies appear?

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
And pretty soon, a picture started emerging.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
In Bangalore, a colleague there sent me

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
information for three years, average,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
24th of September, so late September.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Down in Trivandrum, a bit later.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Far north of Maldives, a bit later.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Then Malé, then further south.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
And then the southernmost Maldives.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
It's pretty obvious, they're coming from India.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
But they are coming 400 miles across the ocean, against the wind.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
How on Earth are they doing that?

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
I didn't know.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
The next thing I did was I started counting dragonflies.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
I wanted to know about their seasonality,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
what time of year, this is when they first arrive,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
but how long are they around for? Does that give any clues?

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
So, I started a very rigorous scientific process.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
I had a rigorous scientific transect.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
I got on my bicycle,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
and I cycled around the island of Malé.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
It's about five kilometers around,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
counting the dragonflies as I go,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
trying not to bump into people as I'm looking in the trees.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
And they're here for a very short time,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
October, November, December. That's it.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
And then they tail off, there's a few, but that's it.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
October, November, December. That is not the northeast monsoon season.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
That's not the southwest season.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
That's the inter-monsoon,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
the time when the monsoon changes.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Now, what I said was, you get the southwest monsoon going one way,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
and then it changes and you get the northeast monsoon going the other way.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
And that sort of gives the impression you've got one air mass

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
going up and down, up and down. It doesn't work like that.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
What happens, actually, is there is two air masses.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
And there is a front between them, and the front moves.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
So, if you've got India here,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
when the front is up above India you're into the southwest monsoon.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Then the front moves into the northeast monsoon.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
And that front in the middle is not vertical,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
it's at an angle.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
So, as it comes over towards Malé

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
I'm standing in Malé underneath the front.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
I can be in the southwest monsoon.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
But the wind above is from the northeast monsoon.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
So, the dragonflies are actually coming from India on the northeast monsoon,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.000
but at an altitude at 1,000 to 2,000 meters up in the air. Incredible.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
These little insects, it's the same ones we see out here [in India],

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
two inches long, five centimeters long,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
flying in their millions, 400 miles across the ocean,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
at 2,000 meters up. Quite incredible.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
So, I was quite pleased with myself. I thought wow, I've tracked this one,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
I know how they come here. Then I scratched my head a bit,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
and that's okay,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
I know how they come here, but why do they come here?

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000
What are millions of dragonflies doing, flying out over the ocean every year

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
to their apparent doom?

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
It doesn't make sense. There is nothing for them in Maldives.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
What on Earth are they doing?

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Well, to cut a long story short,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
they're actually flying right across the ocean.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
They're making it all the way across to East Africa.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
I know that because I have friends who work on fisheries' research vessels

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
who have sent to me reports from boats out in the ocean.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
I know because we have reports from Seychelles,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
which fit in as well, down here.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
And I know because

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
when you look at the rainfall,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
these particular insects, these Globe Skimmers

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
breed in temporary rain water pools.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Okay, they lay their eggs where the seasonal rains are,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
the monsoon rains.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
The larvae have to develop very quickly.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
They only take six weeks. Instead of 11 months, they're six weeks.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
They're up, and they're off.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Now, here we have, in case you can't read at the back,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
the top is rainfall for India.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
And we're starting in June. So this is the monsoon rain.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
By September, October, it's drying out.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Nothing for these dragonflies. There is no more seasonal rain.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
They've got to go hunting for seasonal rain.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
And they fly south. As the monsoon withdraws to the south

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
they come down through Karnataka, into Kerala.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
And then they run out of land.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
But they are incredibly good fliers. This particular species,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
it can fly for thousands of kilometers.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
And it just keeps going. And the wind, the northeast wind

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
swooshes it around and carries it off across the ocean to Africa,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
where it's raining.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
And they are breeding in the rains of Africa.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Now, this is southeast Africa. It makes it look like there are sort of

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
two breeding periods here. It's slightly more complicated than that.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
What's happening is they are breeding in the monsoon rains here.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
And the dragonflies you can see today

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
outside here, on the campus,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
are the young of this generation.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
They hatched out in India.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
They're looking for somewhere to breed. If it rains here they'll breed.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
But most of them are going to carry on. And next stop,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
perhaps only four or five days away is going to be East Africa.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
The wind will swoosh them out across here.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
If they pass the Maldives they might go and have a look,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
nothing there, they'll carry on.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Here, here, Kenya, East Africa,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
they've actually just come out of a long drought.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Just last week the rains broke. The short rains broke

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
and it's raining there now.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
And the dragonflies are there. I have reports from my various contacts.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
The dragonflies are here now. They're breeding there.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
When those guys, they'll lay their eggs now.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
They'll hatch out in six weeks. By that time

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
the seasonal rains have moved on. It's not there, it's down here.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
They'll fly down here. And the clever thing is

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
the wind is always converging to where the rain is.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
The rain occurs, these are summer rains.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
This is a summer monsoon.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
The sun is overhead there. Summer rains in southern Africa.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
The sun is overhead, maximum heating,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
maximum evaporation, maximum clouds,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
maximum rainfall,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
maximum opportunities for reproduction.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Not only that, because you have this convection,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
you have this rising of the air

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
where it's hot, air is drawn in.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
There's a convergence. So, wherever the rain is falling,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
the air is drawn towards it to replace the air that's rising.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
So, the little fellow that hatches out here,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
he gets up into the air, he is automatically carried

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
to where the rain is falling.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Lay their eggs, next generation, they come up,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
automatically carried to where the rain is falling.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
It's now back there. They come out, it's time to come back.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
So, in four generations, one, two, three,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
four and then back.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
A complete circuit of the Indian Ocean.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
This is a circuit of about 16,000 kilometers.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
16,000 kilometers, four generations, mind you,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
for a two inch long insect. It's quite incredible.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Those of you from North America

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
will be familiar with the Monarch butterfly.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Which, up until now has had the longest known insect migration.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
It's only half the length of this one.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
And this crossing here, of the ocean,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
is the only truly regular transoceanic crossing

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
of any insect.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
A quite incredible feat.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
And I only stumbled on this because I was living in Malé,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
in Maldives for long enough

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
for it to percolate into my brain

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
that something rather special was going on.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
But dragonflies are not the only creatures that make the crossing.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
There is more to the story.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
I'm also interested in birds. And I'm familiar

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
with this fellow. This is a rather special bird.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
It's a falcon. It's called the eastern red-footed falcon, obviously.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
But it's also called the Amur Falcon.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
And it's called the Amur Falcon

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
because it breeds in Amurland.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Which is an area along the Amur River, which is up here.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
It's the border, much of it is the border

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
between China and Russia, up here in the far east.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
So, Siberia, Manchuria.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
And that's where it breeds.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
And if you're a falcon it's quite a nice place to be in the summer.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
But it's a pretty miserable place to be in the winter.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
It's, well, you can imagine.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
So, as any sensible bird would do,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
he moves south. They move south. The whole population moves south.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
But then the being sensible stopped.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
So, now they don't stop here, or even down here.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
No, they turn across here.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
They have a little refueling stop in northeastern India.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
They come to the latitude of about Mumbai or Goa.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
And then they strike out across the ocean, down to Kenya.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
And down here, and they winter down here [in southern Africa].

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Incredible. This is the most extraordinary migration

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
of any bird of prey. A quite incredible migration.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
And they are not the only one that makes the crossing.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
They have the most incredible journey, but several make the crossing from India

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
to Africa. Includes this one, the hobby.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
This fellow is a very nice bird, this is the Pied cuckoo.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Those of you from northern India will be familiar with this.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
It comes with the monsoons.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
This time of year they cross back to Africa.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
And this guy, the roller, a rather beautiful bird.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
It's known as the Eurasian Roller. In India it occurs in the northwest,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
so it's known as the Kashmir Roller.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
And these birds, what I've done is I've complied all the records,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
all the available records of these birds,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
put them together, and found out they migrate at exactly the same time

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
as the dragonflies.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
They make use of exactly the same winds.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
They travel at exactly the same time with the same winds

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
to make the crossing. I know they travel at the same altitude.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
It's known about the Amur Falcon. This guy, unfortunately,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
one of these met an unfortunate end.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
He was flying off the coast of Goa,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
21 years ago, 1988. October, 1988.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
An Indian Navy jet was flying off Goa,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
bang! In the middle of the night. Fortunately, a two engine jet

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
got back to base, and they pulled the remains of one of these [Eurasian Rollers] out.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Flying at night over the Indian Ocean 2,424 meters.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Same height as the dragonflies go.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
So, they are using the same winds.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
And the other thing, the other important factor

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
for all these birds, all medium sized fellows,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
and this includes the next slide as well, which is a bee-eater.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Bee-eaters eat bees. This one has a nice blue cheek.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
It's a Blue-cheeked Bee-eater.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
And every one of these birds that makes the crossing

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
from India to East Africa

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
eats insects, large insects,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
the size of dragonflies. Thank you very much.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
(Applause)
