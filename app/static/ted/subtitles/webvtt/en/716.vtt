WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Metaphor lives a secret life all around us.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We utter about six metaphors a minute.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Metaphorical thinking is essential

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
to how we understand ourselves and others,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
how we communicate, learn, discover

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and invent.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
But metaphor is a way of thought before it is a way with words.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Now, to assist me in explaining this,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I've enlisted the help of one of our greatest philosophers,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
the reigning king of the metaphorians,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
a man whose contributions to the field

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
are so great that he himself

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
has become a metaphor.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I am, of course, referring to none other

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
than Elvis Presley.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
(Laughter)

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Now, "All Shook Up" is a great love song.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
It's also a great example of how

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
whenever we deal with anything abstract --

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
ideas, emotions, feelings, concepts, thoughts --

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
we inevitably resort to metaphor.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
In "All Shook Up," a touch is not a touch, but a chill.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Lips are not lips, but volcanoes.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
She is not she, but a buttercup.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And love is not love, but being all shook up.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
In this, Elvis is following Aristotle's classic definition of metaphor

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
as the process of giving the thing

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
a name that belongs to something else.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
This is the mathematics of metaphor.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And fortunately it's very simple.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
X equals Y.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
(Laughter)

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
This formula works wherever metaphor is present.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Elvis uses it, but so does Shakespeare

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
in this famous line from "Romeo and Juliet:"

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Juliet is the sun.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Now, here, Shakespeare gives the thing, Juliet,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
a name that belongs to something else, the sun.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
But whenever we give a thing a name that belongs to something else,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
we give it a whole network of analogies too.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
We mix and match what we know about the metaphor's source,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
in this case the sun,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
with what we know about its target, Juliet.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And metaphor gives us a much more vivid understanding of Juliet

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
than if Shakespeare had literally described what she looks like.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
So, how do we make and understand metaphors?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
This might look familiar.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
The first step is pattern recognition.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Look at this image. What do you see?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Three wayward Pac-Men,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and three pointy brackets are actually present.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
What we see, however,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
are two overlapping triangles.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Metaphor is not just the detection of patterns;

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
it is the creation of patterns.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Second step, conceptual synesthesia.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Now, synesthesia is the experience of a stimulus in once sense organ

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
in another sense organ as well,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
such as colored hearing.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
People with colored hearing

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
actually see colors when they hear the sounds

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
of words or letters.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
We all have synesthetic abilities.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
This is the Bouba/Kiki test.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
What you have to do is identify which of these shapes

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
is called Bouba, and which is called Kiki.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
(Laughter)

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
If you are like 98 percent of other people,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
you will identify the round, amoeboid shape as Bouba,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
and the sharp, spiky one as Kiki.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Can we do a quick show of hands?

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Does that correspond?

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Okay, I think 99.9 would about cover it.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Why do we do that?

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Because we instinctively find, or create,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
a pattern between the round shape

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
and the round sound of Bouba,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and the spiky shape and the spiky sound of Kiki.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And many of the metaphors we use everyday are synesthetic.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Silence is sweet.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Neckties are loud.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Sexually attractive people are hot.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Sexually unattractive people leave us cold.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Metaphor creates a kind of conceptual synesthesia,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
in which we understand one concept

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
in the context of another.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Third step is cognitive dissonance.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
This is the Stroop test.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
What you need to do here is identify

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
as quickly as possible

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
the color of the ink in which these words are printed.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
You can take the test now.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
If you're like most people, you will experience

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
a moment of cognitive dissonance

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
when the name of the color

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
is printed in a differently colored ink.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
The test shows that we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
even when the literal meaning gives the wrong answer.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Stroop tests have been done with metaphor as well.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
The participants had to identify, as quickly as possible,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
the literally false sentences.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
They took longer to reject metaphors as false

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
than they did to reject literally false sentences.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Why? Because we cannot ignore

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
the metaphorical meaning of words either.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
One of the sentences was, "Some jobs are jails."

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Now, unless you're a prison guard,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
the sentence "Some jobs are jails" is literally false.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Sadly, it's metaphorically true.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And the metaphorical truth interferes with our ability

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
to identify it as literally false.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Metaphor matters because

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
it's around us every day, all the time.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Metaphor matters because it creates expectations.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Pay careful attention the next time you read the financial news.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Agent metaphors describe price movements

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
as the deliberate action of a living thing,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
as in, "The NASDAQ climbed higher."

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Object metaphors describe price movements

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
as non-living things,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
as in, "The Dow fell like a brick."

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Researchers asked a group of people

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
to read a clutch of market commentaries,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
and then predict the next day's price trend.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Those exposed to agent metaphors

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
had higher expectations that price trends would continue.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
And they had those expectations because

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
agent metaphors imply the deliberate action

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
of a living thing pursuing a goal.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
If, for example, house prices

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
are routinely described as climbing and climbing,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
higher and higher, people might naturally assume

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
that that rise is unstoppable.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
They may feel confident, say,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
in taking out mortgages they really can't afford.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
That's a hypothetical example of course.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
But this is how metaphor misleads.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Metaphor also matters because it influences decisions

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
by activating analogies.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
A group of students was told that a small democratic country

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
had been invaded and had asked the U.S. for help.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
And they had to make a decision.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
What should they do?

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Intervene, appeal to the U.N., or do nothing?

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
They were each then given one of three

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
descriptions of this hypothetical crisis.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Each of which was designed to trigger

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
a different historical analogy:

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
World War II, Vietnam,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
and the third was historically neutral.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Those exposed to the World War II scenario

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
made more interventionist recommendations

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
than the others.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Just as we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
we cannot ignore the analogies

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
that are triggered by metaphor.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Metaphor matters because it opens the door to discovery.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Whenever we solve a problem, or make a discovery,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
we compare what we know with what we don't know.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
And the only way to find out about the latter

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
is to investigate the ways it might be like the former.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Einstein described his scientific method as combinatory play.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
He famously used thought experiments,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
which are essentially elaborate analogies,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
to come up with some of his greatest discoveries.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
By bringing together what we know

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
and what we don't know through analogy,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
metaphorical thinking strikes the spark

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
that ignites discovery.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Now metaphor is ubiquitous, yet it's hidden.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
But you just have to look at the words around you

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
and you'll find it.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Ralph Waldo Emerson described language

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
as "fossil poetry."

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
But before it was fossil poetry

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
language was fossil metaphor.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
And these fossils still breathe.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Take the three most famous words in all of Western philosophy:

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
"Cogito ergo sum."

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
That's routinely translated as, "I think, therefore I am."

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
But there is a better translation.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
The Latin word "cogito"

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
is derived from the prefix "co," meaning "together,"

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
and the verb "agitare," meaning "to shake."

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
So, the original meaning of "cogito"

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
is to shake together.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
And the proper translation of "cogito ergo sum"

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
is "I shake things up, therefore I am."

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
(Laughter)

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Metaphor shakes things up,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
giving us everything from Shakespeare to scientific discovery in the process.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
The mind is a plastic snow dome,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
the most beautiful, most interesting,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
and most itself, when, as Elvis put it,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
it's all shook up.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
And metaphor keeps the mind shaking,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
rattling and rolling, long after Elvis has left the building.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Thank you very much.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
(Applause)
