WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The anger in me against corruption

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
made me to make a big career change

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
last year, becoming a full-time practicing lawyer.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
My experiences over the last 18 months,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
as a lawyer, has seeded in me

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
a new entrepreneurial idea,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
which I believe is indeed

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
worth spreading.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So, I share it with all of you here today,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
though the idea itself is getting crystallized

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and I'm still writing up the business plan.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Of course it helps that fear of public failure

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
diminishes as the number of ideas

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
which have failed increases.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I've been a huge fan of enterprise and entrepreneurship

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
since 1993.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I've explored, experienced,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and experimented enterprise

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and capitalism to my heart's content.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I built, along with my two brothers,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
the leading real estate company in my home state, Kerala,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and then worked professionally

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
with two of India's biggest businessmen,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
but in their startup enterprises.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
In 2003, when I stepped out of the pure play capitalistic sector

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
to work on so-called social sector issues,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I definitely did not have any grand strategy

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
or plan to pursue and find

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
for-profit solutions

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
to addressing pressing public issues.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
When life brought about a series

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
of death and near-death experiences

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
within my close circle,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
which highlighted the need

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
for an emergency medical response service in India,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
similar to 911 in USA.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
To address this, I, along with four friends,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
founded Ambulance Access for All,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
to promote life-support ambulance services in India.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
For those from the developing world,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
there is nothing, absolutely nothing new in this idea.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
But as we envisioned it,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
we had three key goals:

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Providing world-class life support ambulance service

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
which is fully self-sustainable from its own revenue streams,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and universally accessible

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
to anyone in a medical emergency,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
irrespective of the capability to pay.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
The service which grew out of this,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Dial 1298 for Ambulance,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
with one ambulance in 2004,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
now has a hundred-plus ambulances in three states,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and has transported over 100,000 patients

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and victims since inception.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
The service is -- (Applause)

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
fully self-sustainable from its own revenues,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
without accessing any public funds,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and the cross-subsidy model actually works,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
where the rich pays higher, poor pays lower,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and the accident victim is getting the service free of charge.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
The service responded effectively

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and efficiently,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
during the unfortunate

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And as you can see from the visuals,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
the service was responding and rescuing

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
victims from the incident locations

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
even before the police could cordon off

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
the incident locations

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
and formally confirm it as a terror strike.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
We ended up being the first medical response team

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
in every incident location

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
and transported 125 victims,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
saving life.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
(Applause)

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
In tribute and remembrance

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
of 26/11 attacks

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
over the last one year,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
we have actually helped a Pakistani NGO,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Aman Foundation,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
to set up a self-sustainable life support ambulance service

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
in Karachi, facilitated by Acumen Fund.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000
(Applause)

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
It's a small message from us,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
in our own small way

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
to the enemies of humanity,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
of Islam, of South Asia,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
of India, and of Pakistan,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
that humanity will continue to bloom,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
irrespective of such dastardly attacks.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Since then I've also co-founded two other social enterprises.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
One is Education Access for All,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
setting up schools in small-town India.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And the other is Moksha-Yug Access,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
which is integrating rural supply chain

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
on the foundations of self-help group-based microfinance.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
I guess we seem to be doing at least a few things right.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Because diligent investors and venture funds

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
have committed over 7.5 million dollars in funding.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
With the significance being these funds have come in

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
as a QT capital, not as grant or as philanthropy.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Now I come back to the idea of the new social enterprise

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
that I'm exploring.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Corruption, bribes, and lack of transparency.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
You may be surprised to know

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
that eight speakers yesterday

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
actually mentioned these terms in their talks.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Bribes and corruption have both a demand and a supply side,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
with the supply side being mostly of

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
greedy corporate unethical businesses

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
and hapless common man.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And the demand side being mostly politicians,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
bureaucrats and those who have discretionary power

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
vested with them.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
According to World Bank estimate,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
one trillion dollars is paid in bribes

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
every year, worsening the condition

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
of the already worse off.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Yet, if you analyze the common man,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
he or she does not wake up every day and say,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
"Hmm, let me see who I can pay a bribe to today."

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
or, "Let me see who I can corrupt today."

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Often it is the constraining or the back-to-the-wall situation

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
that the hapless common man finds himself or herself in

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
that leads him to pay a bribe.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
In the modern day world, where time is premium

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
and battle for subsistence is unimaginably tough,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
the hapless common man

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
simply gives in and pays the bribe just to get on with life.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Now, let me ask you another question.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Imagine you are being asked to pay a bribe

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
in your day-to-day life to get something done.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
What do you do? Of course you can call the police.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
But what is the use if the police department is in itself steeped in corruption?

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Most definitely you don't want to pay the bribe.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
But you also don't have the time, resources,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
expertise or wherewithal to fight this.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Unfortunately, many of us in this room

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
are supporters of capitalist policies and market forces.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Yet the market forces around the world

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
have not yet thrown up a service where you can call in,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
pay a fee, and fight the demand for a bribe.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Like a bribe buster service,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
or 1-800-Fight-Bribes,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
or www.stopbribes.org or

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
www.preventcorruption.org.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Such a service simply do not exist.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
One image that has haunted me

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
from my early business days

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
is of a grandmother, 70 plus years, being harassed

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
by the bureaucrats in the town planning office.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
All she needed was permission to build three steps

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
to her house, from ground level,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
making it easier for her to enter and exit her house.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Yet the officer in charge would not simply give her the permit

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
for want of a bribe.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Even though it pricked my conscience then,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
I could not, or rather I did not

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
tend to her or assist her,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
because I was busy building my real estate company.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
I don't want to be haunted by such images any more.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
A group of us have been working on a pilot basis

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
to address individual instances of demands

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
for bribes for common services or entitlement.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
And in all 42 cases where we have pushed back such demands

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
using existing and legitimate tools

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
like the Right to Information Act,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
video, audio, or peer pressure,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
we have successfully obtained whatever our clients

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
set out to achieve without actually paying a bribe.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
And with the cost of these tools being substantially lower

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
than the bribe demanded.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
I believe that these tools that worked in these 42 pilot cases

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
can be consolidated in standard processes

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
in a BPO kind of environment,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
and made available on web, call-center

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
and franchise physical offices,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
for a fee, to serve anyone confronted with a demand for a bribe.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
The target market is as tempting as it can get.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
It can be worth up to one trillion dollars,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
being paid in bribes every year,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
or equal to India's GDP.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
And it is an absolutely virgin market.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
I propose to explore this idea further,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
to examine the potential of creating

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
a for-profit, fee-based BPO

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
kind of service to stop bribes

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
and prevent corruption.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
I do realize that the fight for justice

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
against corruption is never easy.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
It never has been and it never will be.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
In my last 18 months as a lawyer,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
battling small- and large-scale corruption,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
including the one perpetrated by India's biggest corporate scamster.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Through his charities

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
I have had three police cases filed against me

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
alleging trespass, impersonation and intimidation.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
The battle against corruption

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
exacts a toll on ourselves,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000
our families, our friends, and even our kids.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Yet I believe the price we pay is well worth holding on

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
to our dignity and making the world a fairer place.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
What gives us the courage?

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
As my close friend replied, when told

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
during the seeding days of the ambulance project

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
that it is an impossible task

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
and the founders are insane to chalk up their blue-chip jobs,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
I quote: "Of course we cannot fail in this,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
at least in our own minds.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
For we are insane people,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
trying to do an impossible task.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
And an insane person does not know what an impossible task is." Thank you.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:16.000
(Applause)

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Chris Anderson: Shaffi, that is a really exciting business idea.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Shaffi Mather: I just have to get through the initial days where I don't get eliminated.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
(Laughter)

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000
CA: What's on your mind?

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
I mean, give us a sense of the numbers here --

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
a typical bribe and a typical fee. I mean, what's in your head?

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000
SM: So let me ... Let me give you an example.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Somebody who had applied for the passport.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
The officer was just sitting on it

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
and was demanding around 3,000 rupees in bribes.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
And he did not want to pay.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
So we actually used the Right to Information Act,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
which is equal to the Freedom of Information Act in the United States,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000
and pushed back the officers in this particular case.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
And in all these 42 cases,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
when we kept pushing them back,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
there was three kinds of reaction.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
A set of people actually say,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
"Oh, let me just grant it to them, and run away from it."

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Some people actually come back and say,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
"Oh, you want to screw me. Let me show you what I can do."

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
And he will push us back.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
So you take the next step, or use the next tool available

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
in what we are putting together,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
and then he relents.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
By the third time, in all 42 cases, we have achieved success.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000
CA: But if it's a 3,000-rupee, 70-dollar bribe,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
what fee would you have to charge,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
and can you actually make the business work?

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
SM: Well, actually the cost that we incurred

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
was less than 200 rupees.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
So, it actually works.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
CA: That's a high gross margin business. I like it.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
(Laughter)

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
SM: I actually did not want to answer this on the TED stage.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
CA: OK, so these are provisional numbers, no pricing guarantee.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
If you can pull this off, you will be a global hero.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
I mean, this could be huge.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Thank you so much for sharing this idea at TED.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
(Applause)
