00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The key question is, "When are we going to get fusion?"

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
It's really been a long time since we've known about fusion.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We've known about fusion since 1920,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
when Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and the British Association for the Advancement of Science

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
conjectured that that's why the sun shines.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I've always been very worried about resource.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I don't know about you, but

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
when my mother gave me food,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I always sorted the ones I disliked

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
from the ones I liked.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And I ate the disliked ones first,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
because the ones you like, you want to save.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And as a child you're always worried about resource.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And once it was sort of explained to me

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
how fast we were using up the world's resources,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I got very upset,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
about as upset as I did when I realized

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
that the Earth will only last about five billion years

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
before it's swallowed by the sun.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Big events in my life,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
a strange child.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
(Laughter)

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Energy, at the moment, is dominated by resource.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
The countries that make a lot of money out of energy

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
have something underneath them.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Coal-powered industrial revolution in this country --

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
oil, gas, sorry.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
(Laughter)

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Gas, I'm probably the only person

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
who really enjoys it when Mister Putin

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
turns off the gas tap, because my budget goes up.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
We're really dominated now

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
by those things that we're using up faster and faster and faster.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And as we try to lift billions of people out of poverty

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
in the Third World, in the developing world,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
we're using energy faster and faster.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And those resources are going away.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And the way we'll make energy in the future

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
is not from resource,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
it's really from knowledge.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
If you look 50 years into the future,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
the way we probably will be making energy

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
is probably one of these three,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
with some wind, with some other things,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
but these are going to be the base load energy drivers.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Solar can do it, and we certainly have to develop solar.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
But we have a lot of knowledge to gain before we can make solar

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
the base load energy supply for the world.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Fission.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Our government is going to put in six new nuclear power stations.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
They're going to put in six new nuclear power stations,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and probably more after that.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
China is building nuclear power stations. Everybody is.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Because they know that that is one sure way

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
to do carbon-free energy.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
But if you wanted to know what the perfect energy source is,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
the perfect energy source is one

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
that doesn't take up much space,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
has a virtually inexhaustible supply,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
is safe, doesn't put any carbon into the atmosphere,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
doesn't leave any long-lived radioactive waste:

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
it's fusion.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
But there is a catch. Of course there is always a catch in these cases.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Fusion is very hard to do.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
We've been trying for 50 years.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Okay. What is fusion? Here comes the nuclear physics.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And sorry about that, but this is what turns me on.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
(Laughter)

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
I was a strange child.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Nuclear energy comes for a simple reason.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
The most stable nucleus is iron, right in the middle of the periodic table.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
It's a medium-sized nucleus.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And you want to go towards iron if you want to get energy.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
So, uranium, which is very big, wants to split.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
But small atoms want to join together,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
small nuclei want to join together

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
to make bigger ones to go towards iron.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
And you can get energy out this way.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
And indeed that's exactly what stars do.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
In the middle of stars, you're joining hydrogen together to make helium

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and then helium together to make carbon,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
to make oxygen, all the things that you're made of

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
are made in the middle of stars.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
But it's a hard process to do

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
because, as you know, the middle of a star is quite hot,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
almost by definition.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
And there is one reaction

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
that's probably the easiest fusion reaction to do.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
It's between two isotopes of hydrogen, two kinds of hydrogen:

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
deuterium, which is heavy hydrogen,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
which you can get from seawater,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
and tritium which is super-heavy hydrogen.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
These two nuclei, when they're far apart, are charged.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And you push them together and they repel.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
But when you get them close enough,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
something called the strong force starts to act

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
and pulls them together.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
So, most of the time they repel.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
You get them closer and closer and closer and then at some point

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
the strong force grips them together.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
For a moment they become helium 5,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
because they've got five particles inside them.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
So, that's that process there. Deuterium and tritium goes together

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
makes helium 5.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Helium splits out, and a neutron comes out

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
and lots of energy comes out.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
If you can get something to about 150 million degrees,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
things will be rattling around so fast

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
that every time they collide in just the right configuration,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
this will happen, and it will release energy.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
And that energy is what powers fusion.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
And it's this reaction that we want to do.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
There is one trickiness about this reaction.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Well, there is a trickiness that you have to make it 150 million degrees,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
but there is a trickiness about the reaction yet.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
It's pretty hot.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
The trickiness about the reaction is that

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
tritium doesn't exist in nature.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
You have to make it from something else.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
And you make if from lithium. That reaction at the bottom,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
that's lithium 6, plus a neutron,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
will give you more helium, plus tritium.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And that's the way you make your tritium.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
But fortunately, if you can do this fusion reaction,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
you've got a neutron, so you can make that happen.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Now, why the hell would we bother to do this?

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
This is basically why we would bother to do it.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
If you just plot how much fuel

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
we've got left, in units of

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
present world consumption.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
And as you go across there you see

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
a few tens of years of oil -- the blue line, by the way,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
is the lowest estimate of existing resources.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
And the yellow line is the most optimistic estimate.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
And as you go across there you will see

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
that we've got a few tens of years, and perhaps 100 years

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
of fossil fuels left.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
And god knows we don't really want to burn all of it,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
because it will make an awful lot of carbon in the air.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And then we get to uranium.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
And with current reactor technology

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
we really don't have very much uranium.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
And we will have to extract uranium from sea water,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
which is the yellow line,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
to make conventional nuclear power stations

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
actually do very much for us.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
This is a bit shocking, because in fact our government

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
is relying on that for us to meet Kyoto,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
and do all those kind of things.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
To go any further you would have to have breeder technology.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
And breeder technology is fast breeders. And that's pretty dangerous.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
The big thing, on the right,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
is the lithium we have in the world.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
And lithium is in sea water. That's the yellow line.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
And we have 30 million years worth of fusion fuel in sea water.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Everybody can get it. That's why we want to do fusion.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Is it cost-competitive?

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
We make estimates of what we think it would cost

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
to actually make a fusion power plant.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
And we get within about the same price

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
as current electricity.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
So, how would we make it?

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
We have to hold something at 150 million degrees.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
And, in fact, we've done this.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
We hold it with a magnetic field.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And inside it, right in the middle of this toroidal shape, doughnut shape,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
right in the middle is 150 million degrees.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
It boils away in the middle at 150 million degrees.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
And in fact we can make fusion happen.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And just down the road, this is JET.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
It's the only machine in the world that's actually done fusion.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
When people say fusion is 30 years away, and always will be,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
I say, "Yeah, but we've actually done it." Right?

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
We can do fusion. In the center of this device

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
we made 16 megawatts of fusion power in 1997.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
And in 2013 we're going to fire it up again

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
and break all those records.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
But that's not really fusion power. That's just making some fusion happen.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
We've got to take that, we've got to make that into a fusion reactor.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Because we want 30 million years worth of fusion power for the Earth.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
This is the device we're building now.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
It gets very expensive to do this research.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
It turns out you can't do fusion on a table top

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
despite all that cold fusion nonsense. Right?

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
You can't. You have to do it in a very big device.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
More than half the world's population is involved in building this device

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
in southern France, which is a nice place to put an experiment.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Seven nations are involved in building this.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
It's going to cost us 10 billion. And we'll produce half a gigawatt of fusion power.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
But that's not electricity yet.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
We have to get to this.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
We have to get to a power plant.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
We have to start putting electricity on the grid

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
in this very complex technology.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
And I'd really like it to happen a lot faster than it is.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
But at the moment, all we can imagine is sometime in the 2030s.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
I wish this were different. We really need it now.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
We're going to have a problem with power

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
in the next five years in this country.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000
So 2030 looks like an infinity away.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
But we can't abandon it now; we have to push forward,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
get fusion to happen.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
I wish we had more money, I wish we had more resources.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
But this is what we're aiming at,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
sometime in the 2030s --

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
real electric power from fusion. Thank you very much.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
