00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Namaste. Salaam.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Shalom. Sat Sri Akal.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Greetings to all of you from Pakistan.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It is often said that we fear that which we do not know.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And Pakistan, in this particular vein, is very similar.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Because it has provoked, and does provoke,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
a visceral anxiety in the bellies of many a Western soul,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
especially when viewed through the monochromatic lens

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
of turbulence and turmoil.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
But there are many other dimensions to Pakistan.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And what follows is a stream of images,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
a series of images captured by some of Pakistan's

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
most dynamic and young photographers,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
that aims to give you an alternative glimpse,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
a look inside the hearts and minds

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
of some ordinary Pakistani citizens.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Here are some of the stories they wanted us to share with you.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
My name is Abdul Khan. I come from Peshawar.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I hope that you will be able to see

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
not just my Taliban-like beard,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
but also the richness and color

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
of my perceptions, aspirations and dreams,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
as rich and colorful as the satchels that I sell.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
My name is Meher and this is my friend Irim.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I hope to become a vet when I grow up

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
so that I can take care of stray cats and dogs

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
who wander around the streets of the village

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
that I live near Gilgit, northern Pakistan.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
My name is Kailash. And I like to enrich lives

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
through technicolored glass.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Madame, would you like some of those orange bangles

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
with the pink polka dots?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
My name is Zamin.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And I'm an IDP, an internally displaced person,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
from Swat.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Do you see me on the other side of this fence?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Do I matter, or really exist for you?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
My name is Iman. I am a fashion model,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
an up-and-coming model from Lahore.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Do you see me simply smothered in cloth?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Or can you move beyond my veil

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and see me for who I truly am inside?

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
My name is Ahmed. I am an Afghan refugee

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
from the Khyber agency.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I have come from a place of intense darkness.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And that is why I want to illuminate the world.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
My name is Papusay.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
My heart and drum beat as one.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
If religion is the opium of the masses,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
then for me, music is my one and only ganja.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
A rising tide lifts all boats.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And the rising tide of India's

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
spectacular economic growth

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
has lifted over 400 million

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Indians into a buoyant middle class.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
But there are still over 650 million Indians,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Pakistanis, Sri Lankans, Bangladeshis, Nepalese,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
who remain washed up on the shores of poverty.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Therefore as India and Pakistan, as you and I,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
it behooves us to transcend our differences,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
to celebrate our diversity,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
to leverage our common humanity.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Our collective vision at Naya Jeevan,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
which for many of you, as you all recognize,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
means "new life" in Urdu and Hindi,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
is to rejuvenate the lives of millions of low income families

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
by providing them with affordable access

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
to catastrophic health care.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Indeed it is the emerging world's first

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
HMO for the urban working poor.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Why should we do this as Indians and Pakistanis?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
We are but two threads cut from the same cloth.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And if our fates are intertwined,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
then we believe that it is good karma, it is good fortune.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
And for many of us, our fortunes do indeed lie

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
at the bottom of the pyramid. Thank you.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
(Applause)

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Chris Anderson: Fantastic. Just stay up here.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
That was fantastic.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
I found that really moving.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
You know, we fought hard to get at least

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
a small Pakistani contingent to come.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
It felt like it was really important.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
They went through a lot to get here.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Would the Pakistanis please just stand up please?

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
I just really wanted to acknowledge you.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:06.000
(Applause)

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Thank you so much.
