WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Well, I learned a lot of things about ballooning,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
especially at the end of these balloon flights

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
around the world I did with Brian Jones.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
When I took this picture,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
the window was frozen because of the moisture of the night.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And on the other side there was a rising sun.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So, you see that on the other side of ice

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
you have the unknown,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
you have the non-obvious,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
you have the non-seen,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
for the people who don't dare

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
to go through the ice.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
There are so many people

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
who prefer to suffer in the ice they know

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
instead of taking the risk of going through the ice

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
to see what there is on the other side.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And I think that's one of the main problems of our society.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We learn, maybe not the famous TED audience,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
but so many other people learn,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
that the unknown, the doubts,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
the question marks are dangerous.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And we have to resist to the changes.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We have to keep everything under control.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Well, the unknown is part of life.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And in that sense, ballooning is a beautiful metaphor.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Because in the balloon, like in life,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
we go very well in unforeseen directions.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
We want to go in a direction,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
but the winds push us in another direction, like in life.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And as long as we fight horizontally,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
against life, against the winds,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
against what's happening to us,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
life is a nightmare.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
How do we steer a balloon?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
By understanding that the atmosphere

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
is made out of several different layers of wind

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
which all have different direction.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
So, then, we understand that if we want to change our trajectory,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
in life, or in the balloon,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
we have to change altitude.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Changing altitude, in life,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
that means raising to another psychological, philosophical,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
spiritual level.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
But how do we do that?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
In ballooning, or in life,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
how do we change altitude?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
How do we go from the metaphor

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
to something more practical that we can really

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
use every day?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Well, in a balloon it's easy, we have ballast.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And when we drop the ballast overboard we climb.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Sand, water, all the equipment we don't need anymore.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
And I think in life it should be exactly like this.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
You know, when people speak about pioneering spirit,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
very often they believe that pioneers

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
are the ones who have new ideas.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
It's not true.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
The pioneers are not the ones who have new ideas,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
because new ideas are so easy to have.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
We just close our eyes for a minute we all come back

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
with a lot of new ideas.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
No, the pioneer is the one who

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
allows himself to throw overboard a lot of ballast.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Habits, certainties,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
convictions, exclamation marks,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
paradigms, dogmas.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And when we are able to do that,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
what happens?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Life is not anymore

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
just one line going in one direction

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
in one dimension. No.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Life is going to be made out of all the possible lines

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
that go in all the possible directions

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
in three dimensions.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And pioneering spirit will be each time we allow ourselves

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
to explore this vertical axis.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Of course not just like the atmosphere in the balloon,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
but in life itself.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Explore this vertical axis, that means

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
explore all the different ways to do,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
all the different ways to behave, all the different ways to think,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
before we find the one that goes in the direction we wish.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
This is very practical.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
This can be in politics.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
This can be in spirituality.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
This can be in environment,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
in finance, in education of children.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
I deeply believe

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
that life is a much greater adventure

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
if we manage to do politics

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
without the trench between the left and the right wing.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Because we will throw away these political dogmas.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
I deeply believe that we can make much more protection of the environment

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
if we get rid -- if we throw overboard

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000
this fundamentalism that some of the greens have showed in the past.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
And that we can aim for much higher spirituality

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
if we get rid of the religious dogmas.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Throwing overboard, as ballast, to change our direction.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Well, these basically are things I believed in such a long time.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
But actually I had to go around the world in a balloon

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
to be invited to talk about it.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
(Laughter)

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000
(Applause)

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
It's clear that it's not easy to know which ballast to drop

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
and which altitude to take. Sometime we need

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
friends, family members or a psychiatrist.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Well, in balloons we need weather men,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
the one who calculate the direction of each layer of wind,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
at which altitude, in order to help the balloonist.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
But sometimes it's very paradoxical.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
When Brian Jones and I were flying around the world,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
the weather man asked us, one day, to fly

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
quite low, and very slow.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And when we calculated we thought we're never going to make it

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
around the world at that speed.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
So, we disobeyed. We flew much higher, and double the speed.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And I was so proud to have found that jetstream

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
that I called the weather man,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
and I told him, "Hey, guy, don't you think we're good pilots up there?

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
We fly twice the speed you predicted."

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
And he told me, "Don't do that. Go down immediately

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
in order to slow down."

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And I started to argue. I said, "I'm not going to do that.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
We don't have enough gas to fly so slow."

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
And he told me, "Yes, but with the low pressure you have on your left

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
if you fly too fast, in a couple of hours

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
you will turn left and end up at the North Pole.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
(Laughter)

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
And then he asked me --

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
and this is something I will never forget in my life --

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
he just asked me, "You're the good pilot up there.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
What do you really want? You want to go very fast

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
in the wrong direction, or slowly in the good direction?

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
(Laughter)

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
(Applause)

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
And this is why you need weathermen.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
This is why you need people with long-term vision.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And this is precisely what fails

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
in the political visions we have now,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
in the political governments.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
We are burning, as you heard,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
so much energy,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
not understanding that such an unsustainable

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
way of life cannot last for long.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
So, we went down actually.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
We slowed down. And we went through moments of fears

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
because we had no idea how the little amount of gas

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
we had in the balloon

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
could allow us to travel 45,000 kilometers.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
But we were expected to have doubts; we're expected to have fears.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
And actually this is where the adventure really started.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
When we were flying over the Sahara and India

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
it was nice holidays.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
We could land anytime and fly back home with an airplane.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
In the middle of the Pacific,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
when you don't have the good winds, you cannot land,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
you cannot go back.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
That's a crisis.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
That's the moment when you have to wake up

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
from the automatic way of thinking.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
That's the moment when you have to motivate

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
your inner potential,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
your creativity.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
That's when you throw out all the ballast,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
all the certainties,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
in order to adapt to the new situation.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
And actually, we changed completely our flight plan.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
We changed completely our strategy.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
And after 20 days we landed successfully in Egypt.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
But if I show you this picture

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
it's not to tell you how happy we were.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
It's to show you how much gas was left

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
in the last bottles.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.000
We took off with 3.7 tons of liquid propane.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000
We landed with 40 kilos.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
When I saw that, I made a promise to myself.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
I made a promise that the next time I would fly around the world,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
it would be with no fuel,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
independent from fossil energies,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
in order to be safe,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
not to be threatened by the fuel gauge.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
I had no idea how it was possible.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
I just thought it's a dream and I want to do it.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
And when the capsule of my balloon was introduced

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
officially in the Air and Space Museum in Washington,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
together with the airplane of Charles Lindbergh,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
with Apollo 11, with the Wright Brothers' Flyer,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
with Chuck Yeager's 61,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
I had really a thought then.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
I thought, well, the 20th century, that was brilliant.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
It allowed to do all those things there.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
But it will not be possible in the future any more.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
It takes too much energy. It will cost too much.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
It will be prohibited

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
because we'll have to save our natural resources

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
in a few decades from now.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
So how can we perpetuate

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
this pioneering spirit

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
with something that will be independent from fossil energy?

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
And this is when the project Solar Impulse

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
really started to

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
turn in my head.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And I think it's a nice metaphor also

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
for the 21st century.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Pioneering spirit should continue, but on another level.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Not to conquer the planet or space,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
not anymore, it has been done,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
but rather to improve the quality of life.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
How can we go through the ice of certainty

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
in order to make the most incredible a possible thing?

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
What is today completely impossible --

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
get rid of our dependency on fossil energy.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
If you tell to people, we want to be independent

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
from fossil energy in our world,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
people will laugh at you, except here,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
where crazy people are invited to speak.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
(Laughter)

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
So, the idea is that if we fly around the world

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
in a solar powered airplane,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
using absolutely no fuel,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
nobody ever could say in the future

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
that it's impossible to do it

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
for cars, for heating systems,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
for computers, and so on and so on.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Well, solar power airplanes are not new.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
They have flown in the past, but without

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
saving capabilities, without batteries.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Which means that they have more proven

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
the limits of renewable energies

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
than the potential of it.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
If we want to show the potential,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
we have to fly day and night.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
That means to load the batteries during the flight,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
in order to spend the night on the batteries,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
and fly the next day again.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
It has been made, already, on remote controlled

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
little airplane models, without pilots.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
But it stays an anecdote

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
because the public couldn't identify to it.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
I think you need a pilot in the plane

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
that can talk to the universities,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
that can talk to students,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
talk to politicians during the flight,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
and really make it a human adventure.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
For that, unfortunately,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
four meters wingspan is not enough.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
You need 64 meter wingspan.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
64 meter wingspan to carry one pilot, the batteries,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
flies slowly enough with the aerodynamic efficiency.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Why that? Because fuel is not easy to replace.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
That's for sure.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And with 200 square meters of solar power on our plane,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
we can produce the same energy

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
than 200 little lightbulbs.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
That means a Christmas tree, a big Christmas tree.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
So the question is, how can you carry a pilot around the world

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
with an airplane that uses

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
the same amount of energy as a big Christmas tree?

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
People will tell you it's impossible,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
and that's exactly why we try to do it.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
We launched the project with my colleague Andre Borschberg

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
six years ago.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
We have now 70 people in the team working on it.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
We have gone through the stages of simulation, design,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
computing, preparing the construction

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
of the first prototype.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
That has been achieved after two years of work.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Cockpit, propeller, engine.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Just the fuselage here, it's so light.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
It's not designed by an artist, but it could be.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
50 kilos for the entire fuselage.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Couple of kilos more for the wing spars.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
This is the complete structure of the airplane.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
And one month ago we have unveiled it.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
You cannot imagine how it is for a team

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
who has been working six years on it

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
to show that it's not only a dream and a vision,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
it's a real airplane.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
A real airplane that we could finally present.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
And what's the goal now?

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
The goal is to take off,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
end of this year for the first test,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
but mainly next year, spring or summer,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
take off, on our own power,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
without additional help, without being towed,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
climb to 9,000 meters altitude.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
The same time we load the batteries,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:01.000
we run the engines, and when we get at the maximum height,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
we arrive at the beginning of the night.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
And there, there will be just one goal, just one:

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
reach the next sunrise before the batteries are empty.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
(Laughter)

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And this is exactly the symbol of our world.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
If our airplane is too heavy,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
if the pilot wastes energy,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
we'll never make it through the night.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
And in our world, if we keep on spoiling,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
wasting our energy resources,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
if we keep on building things that consume so much energy

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000
that most of the companies now go bankrupt,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
it's clear that we'll never give the planet to the next generation

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
without a major problem.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
So, you see that this airplane is more a symbol.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
I don't think it will transport 200 people

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
in the next years.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
But when Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
the payload was also just sufficient

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
for one person and some fuel.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
And 20 years later there were 200 people

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
in every airplane crossing the Atlantic.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
So, we have to start,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
and show the example.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
A little bit like on this picture here.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
This is a painting from Magritte,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
in the museum in Holland that I love so much.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
It's a pipe, and it's written, "This is not a pipe."

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
This is not an airplane.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
This is a symbol of what we can achieve

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
when we believe in the impossible,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
when we have a team,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
when we have pioneering spirit,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
and especially when we understand

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
that all the certainties we have

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
should be thrown overboard.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
What pleases me very much

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
is that in the beginning I thought that we would have to fly

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
around the world with no fuel

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
in order to have our message been understood.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
And more and more, we're invited around the world with Andre

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
to talk about that project, to talk about the symbol of it,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
invited by politicians, invited in energy forums,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
in order to show that it's not anymore

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
completely stupid

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
to think about getting rid of the dependency

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
on fossil energies.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
So, through speeches like this one today,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
through interviews, through meetings,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000
our goal is to get as many people possible on the team.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
The success will not come

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
if we "just," quote, unquote,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
fly around the world in a solar-powered airplane.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
No, the success will come

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
if enough people are motivated

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
to do exactly the same in their daily life,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
save energy, go to renewables.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
And this is possible. You know, with the technologies we have today,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
we can save between 30 and 50 percent

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
of the energy of a country in Europe,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
and we can solve half of the rest with renewables.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
It leaves 25 or 30 percent for

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
oil, gas, coal, nuclear, or whatever.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
This is acceptable.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
This is why all the people who believe

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
in this type of spirit

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
are welcome to be on that team.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
You can just go on SolarImpulse.com, subscribe

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
to just be informed of what we're doing.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
But much more, to get advices,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
to give your comments, to spread the word

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
that if it's possible in the air,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
of course it's possible in the ground.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
And each time we have some ice in the future,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
we have to know that life will be great,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
and the success will be brilliant

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
if we dare to overcome our fear of the ice,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
to go through the obstacle,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
to go through the problem, in order to see what there is on the other side.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
So, you see, this is what we're doing on our side.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Everyone has his goal, has his dreams,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
has his visions.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
The question I leave you with now

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
is which is the ballast

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000
you would like to throw overboard?

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Which will be the altitude at which

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
you would like to fly in your life,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
to get to the success that you wish to have,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
to get to the point that really belongs to you,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
with the potential you have,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
and the one you can really fulfill?

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
Because the most renewable energy we have

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
is our own potential, and our own passion.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
So, let's go for it, and I wish you an excellent adventure

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
in the wings of the future. Thank you.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:26.000
(Applause)
