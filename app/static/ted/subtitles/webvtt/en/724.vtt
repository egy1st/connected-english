00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'd like to talk to you today about the human brain,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
which is what we do research on at the University of California.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Just think about this problem for a second.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Here is a lump of flesh, about three pounds,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
which you can hold in the palm of your hand.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
But it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
It can contemplate the meaning of infinity,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
ask questions about the meaning of its own existence,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
about the nature of God.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And this is truly the most amazing thing in the world.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
It's the greatest mystery confronting human beings:

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
How does this all come about?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Well, the brain, as you know, is made up of neurons.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We're looking at neurons here.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
There are 100 billion neurons in the adult human brain.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And each neuron makes something like 1,000 to 10,000 contacts

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
with other neurons in the brain.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And based on this, people have calculated

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
that the number of permutations and combinations of brain activity

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
exceeds the number of elementary particles in the universe.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So, how do you go about studying the brain?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
One approach is to look at patients who had lesions

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
in different part of the brain, and study changes in their behavior.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
This is what I spoke about in the last TED.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Today I'll talk about a different approach,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
which is to put electrodes in different parts of the brain,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and actually record the activity of individual nerve cells in the brain.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Sort of eavesdrop on the activity of nerve cells in the brain.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Now, one recent discovery that has been made

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
by researchers in Italy, in Parma,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
by Giacomo Rizzolatti and his colleagues,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
is a group of neurons called mirror neurons,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
which are on the front of the brain in the frontal lobes.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Now, it turns out there are neurons

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
which are called ordinary motor command neurons in the front of the brain,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
which have been known for over 50 years.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
These neurons will fire when a person performs a specific action.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
For example, if I do that, and reach and grab an apple,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
a motor command neuron in the front of my brain will fire.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
If I reach out and pull an object, another neuron will fire,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
commanding me to pull that object.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
These are called motor command neurons that have been known for a long time.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
But what Rizzolatti found was

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
a subset of these neurons,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
maybe about 20 percent of them, will also fire

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
when I'm looking at somebody else performing the same action.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
So, here is a neuron that fires when I reach and grab something,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
but it also fires when I watch Joe reaching and grabbing something.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And this is truly astonishing.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Because it's as though this neuron is adopting

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
the other person's point of view.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
It's almost as though it's performing a virtual reality simulation

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
of the other person's action.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Now, what is the significance of these mirror neurons?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
For one thing they must be involved in things like imitation and emulation.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Because to imitate a complex act

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
requires my brain to adopt the other person's point of view.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
So, this is important for imitation and emulation.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Well, why is that important?

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Well, let's take a look at the next slide.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
So, how do you do imitation? Why is imitation important?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Mirror neurons and imitation, emulation.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Now, let's look at culture, the phenomenon of human culture.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
If you go back in time about [75,000] to 100,000 years ago,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
let's look at human evolution, it turns out

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
that something very important happened around 75,000 years ago.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And that is, there is a sudden emergence and rapid spread

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
of a number of skills that are unique to human beings

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
like tool use,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
the use of fire, the use of shelters, and, of course, language,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
and the ability to read somebody else's mind

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and interpret that person's behavior.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
All of that happened relatively quickly.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Even though the human brain had achieved its present size

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
almost three or four hundred thousand years ago,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
100,000 years ago all of this happened very, very quickly.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
And I claim that what happened was

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
the sudden emergence of a sophisticated mirror neuron system,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
which allowed you to emulate and imitate other people's actions.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
So that when there was a sudden accidental discovery

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
by one member of the group, say the use of fire,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
or a particular type of tool, instead of dying out,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
this spread rapidly, horizontally across the population,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
or was transmitted vertically, down the generations.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
So, this made evolution suddenly Lamarckian,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
instead of Darwinian.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Darwinian evolution is slow; it takes hundreds of thousands of years.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
A polar bear, to evolve a coat,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
will take thousands of generations, maybe 100,000 years.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
A human being, a child, can just watch its parent

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
kill another polar bear,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
and skin it and put the skin on its body, fur on the body,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
and learn it in one step. What the polar bear

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
took 100,000 years to learn,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
it can learn in five minutes, maybe 10 minutes.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
And then once it's learned this it spreads

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
in geometric proportion across a population.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
This is the basis. The imitation of complex skills

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
is what we call culture and is the basis of civilization.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Now there is another kind of mirror neuron,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
which is involved in something quite different.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
And that is, there are mirror neurons,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
just as there are mirror neurons for action, there are mirror neurons for touch.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
In other words, if somebody touches me,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
my hand, neuron in the somatosensory cortex

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
in the sensory region of the brain fires.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
But the same neuron, in some cases, will fire

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
when I simply watch another person being touched.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
So, it's empathizing the other person being touched.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
So, most of them will fire when I'm touched

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
in different locations. Different neurons for different locations.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
But a subset of them will fire even when I watch somebody else

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
being touched in the same location.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
So, here again you have neurons

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
which are enrolled in empathy.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Now, the question then arises: If I simply watch another person being touched,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
why do I not get confused and literally feel that touch sensation

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
merely by watching somebody being touched?

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
I mean, I empathize with that person but I don't literally feel the touch.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Well, that's because you've got receptors in your skin,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
touch and pain receptors, going back into your brain

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
and saying "Don't worry, you're not being touched.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
So, empathize, by all means, with the other person,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
but do not actually experience the touch,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
otherwise you'll get confused and muddled."

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Okay, so there is a feedback signal

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
that vetoes the signal of the mirror neuron

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
preventing you from consciously experiencing that touch.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
But if you remove the arm, you simply anesthetize my arm,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
so you put an injection into my arm,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
anesthetize the brachial plexus, so the arm is numb,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
and there is no sensations coming in,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
if I now watch you being touched,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
I literally feel it in my hand.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
In other words, you have dissolved the barrier

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
between you and other human beings.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
So, I call them Gandhi neurons, or empathy neurons.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000
(Laughter)

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
And this is not in some abstract metaphorical sense.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
All that's separating you from him,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
from the other person, is your skin.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Remove the skin, you experience that person's touch in your mind.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
You've dissolved the barrier between you and other human beings.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And this, of course, is the basis of much of Eastern philosophy,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
and that is there is no real independent self,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
aloof from other human beings, inspecting the world,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
inspecting other people.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
You are, in fact, connected not just via Facebook and Internet,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
you're actually quite literally connected by your neurons.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And there is whole chains of neurons around this room, talking to each other.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
And there is no real distinctiveness

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
of your consciousness from somebody else's consciousness.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And this is not mumbo-jumbo philosophy.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
It emerges from our understanding of basic neuroscience.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
So, you have a patient with a phantom limb. If the arm has been removed

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
and you have a phantom, and you watch somebody else

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
being touched, you feel it in your phantom.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Now the astonishing thing is,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
if you have pain in your phantom limb, you squeeze the other person's hand,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
massage the other person's hand,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
that relieves the pain in your phantom hand,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
almost as though the neuron

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
were obtaining relief from merely

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
watching somebody else being massaged.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
So, here you have my last slide.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
For the longest time people have regarded science

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
and humanities as being distinct.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
C.P. Snow spoke of the two cultures:

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
science on the one hand, humanities on the other;

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
never the twain shall meet.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
So, I'm saying the mirror neuron system underlies the interface

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
allowing you to rethink about issues like consciousness,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
representation of self,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
what separates you from other human beings,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
what allows you to empathize with other human beings,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
and also even things like the emergence of culture and civilization,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
which is unique to human beings. Thank you.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
(Applause)
