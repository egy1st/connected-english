00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So, 120 years ago,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Dr. RÃ¶ntgen X-rayed his wife's hand.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Quite why he had to pin her fingers to the floor

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
with her brooch, I'm not sure. It seems a bit extreme to me.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
That image was the start of the X-ray technology.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And I'm still fundamentally using the same principles today.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I'm interpreting it in a more contemporary manner.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The first shot I ever did

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
was of a soda can, which was to promote a brand that we all know,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
so I'm not going to do them any favors by showing you it.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
But the second shot I did was my shoes I was wearing on the day.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And I do really like this shot, because

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
it shows all the detritus that's sort of embedded

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
in the sole of the sneakers.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
It was just one of those pot-luck things where you

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
get it right first time.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Moving on to something a bit larger,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
this is an X-ray of a bus.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And the bus is full of people.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
It's actually the same person. It's just one skeleton.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And back in the '60s,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
they used to teach student radiographers

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
to take X-rays, thankfully not on you and I,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
but on dead people.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
So, I've still got access to one of these dead people

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
called Frieda; she's falling apart, I'm afraid,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
because she's very old and fragile.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
But everyone on that bus is Frieda.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And the bus is taken with a cargo-scanning X-ray,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
which is the sort of machine you have on borders,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
which checks for contraband and drugs and bombs and things.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Fairly obvious what that is.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So, using large-scale objects

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
does sort of create drama

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
because you just don't see X-rays of big things that often.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Technology is moving ahead,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and these large cargo scanner X-rays

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
that work with the digital system are getting better and better and better.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Again though, to make it come alive

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
you need, somehow, to add the human element.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And I think the reason this image works, again, is because

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Frieda is driving the bulldozer.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
(Laughter)

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Quite a difficult brief,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
make a pair of men's pants look beautiful.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
But I think the process, in itself, shows how exquisite they are.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Fashion -- now, I'm sort of anti-fashion because I

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
don't show the surface, I show what's within.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
So, the fashionistas don't really like me

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
because it doesn't matter if Kate Moss is wearing it or if I'm wearing it,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
it looks the same.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
(Laughter)

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
We all look the same inside, believe me.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
The creases in the material and the sort of nuances.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And I show things for really what they are, what they're made of.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I peel back the layers and expose it.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And if it's well made I show it, if it's badly made I show it.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And I'm sure Ross can associate that with design.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
The design comes from within.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
It's not just Topshop,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I get some strange looks when I go out getting my props.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Here I was fumbling around in the ladies' underwear department

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
of a department store, almost got escorted from the premises.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I live opposite a farm. And this was the runt of the litter, a piglet that died.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And what's really interesting is,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
if you look at the legs, you'll notice that the bones haven't fused.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And should that pig have grown,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
unfortunately it was dead, it would have certainly been dead

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
after I X-rayed it, with the amount of radiation I used anyway.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000
(Laughter)

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
But once the bones had fused together

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
it would have been healthy.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
So, that's an empty parka jacket.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
But I quite love the way it's posed.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Nature is my greatest inspiration.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And to carry on with a theme that we've already touched with

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
is how nature is related to architecture.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
If you look at the roof of the Eden Project,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
or the British library, it's all this honeycomb structure.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And I'm sure those architects are inspired,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
as I am, by what surrounds us, by nature.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
This, in fact, is a Victoria water lily leaf

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
that floats on the top of a pond.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
An amaryllis flower looking really three-dimensional.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Seaweed, ebbing in the tide.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Now, how do I do this, and where do I do this, and all of that sort of thing.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
This is my new, purpose-built, X-ray shed.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And the door to my X-ray room

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
is made of lead and steel.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
It weighs 1,250 kilograms and the only exercise I get is opening and closing it.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
(Laughter)

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
The walls are 700 millimeters thick of solid dense concrete.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
So, I'm using quite a lot of radiation.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
A lot more than you'd get in a hospital or a vet's.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
And there I am. This is a quite high-powered X-ray machine.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
What's interesting really about X-ray really

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
is, if you think about it, is that that technology

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
is used for looking for cancer or looking for drugs,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
or looking for contraband or whatever.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And I use that sort of technology

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
to create things that are quite beautiful.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
So, still working with film, I'm afraid.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Technology in X-ray where it's life-size processed,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
apart from these large cargo-scanning machines,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
hasn't moved on enough for the quality of the image

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
and the resolution to be good enough for what I want to do with it,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
which is show my pictures big.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
So, I have to use a 1980s drum scanner,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
which was designed in the days when everyone shot photographs on film.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
They scan each individual X-ray.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And this shows how I do my process of same-size X-rays.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
So, this is, again, my daughter's dress.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Still has the tag in it from me buying it,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
so I can take it back to the shop if she didn't like it.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
But there are four X-ray plates.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
You can see them overlapping.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
So, when you move forward from something fairly small,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
a dress which is this size,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
onto something like that which is done in exactly the same process,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
you can see that that is a lot of work.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
In fact, that is three months solid X-raying.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
There is over 500 separate components.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Boeing sent me a 747 in containers.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And I sent them back an X-ray.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
(Laughter) I kid you not.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Okay, so Frieda is my dead skeleton.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
This, unfortunately, is basically two pictures.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
One on the extreme right is a photograph of an American footballer.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
The one on the left is an x-ray.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
But this time I had to use a real body.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Because I needed all the skin tissue to make it look real,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
to make it look like it was a real athlete.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
So, here I had to use a recently deceased body.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And getting a hold of that was extremely difficult and laborious.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
But people do donate their bodies to art and science.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And when they do, I'm in the queue.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
So, I like to use them.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000
(Laughter)

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000
The coloring, so coloring adds another level to the X-rays.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
It makes it more organic, more natural.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
It's whatever takes my fancy, really.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
It's not accurately colored to how it is in real life.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
That flower doesn't come in bright orange, I don't think.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
But I just like it in bright orange.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
And also with something technical, like these are DJ decks,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
it sort of adds another level.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
It makes a two dimensional image look more three dimensional.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
The most difficult things to X-ray,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
the most technically challenging things to X-ray

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
are the lightest things, the most delicate things.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
To get the detail in a feather,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
believe me, if there is anyone out here who knows anything about X-rays,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
that's quite a challenge.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
I'm now going to show you a short film, I'll step to the side.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Video: (Music)

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
The thing in there is very dangerous.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
If you touch that, you could possibly die

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
through radiation poisoning.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
In my career I've had two exposures to radiation,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
which is two too many, because it stays with you for life.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
It's cumulative.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
(Music)

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000
It has human connotations.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
The fact that it's a child's toy that we all recognize,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
but also it looks like it's a robot,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
and it comes from a sci-fi genus.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
It's a surprise that it has humanity,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:21.000
but also man-made, future, alien associations.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
And it's just a bit spooky.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
(Music)

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
The bus was done with a cargo-scanning X-ray machine,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
which is used on the borders

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
between countries, looking for contraband and illegal immigrants.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
The lorry goes in front of it. And it takes slices

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
of X-rays through the lorry.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
And that's how this was done. It's actually slice, slice.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
It's a bit like a CT scanner in a hospital. Slices.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
And then if you look carefully, there is all little things.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
He's got headphones on, reading the newspaper,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
got a hat on, glasses, got a bag.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
So, these little details

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
help to make it work, make it real.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
(Music)

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
The problem with using living people is that

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
to take an X-ray, if I X-ray you, you get exposed to radiation.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
So, to avoid that --

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
I have to avoid it somehow --

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
is I use dead people.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Now, that's a variety of things, from recently deceased bodies,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
to a skeleton that was used by student radiographers

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
to train in taking X-rays of the human body,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
at different densities.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
(Music)

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
I have very high-tech equipment of gloves, scissors and a bucket.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
(Music)

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
I will show how the capillary action works, how it feeds,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
I'll be able to get all the cells inside that stem.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Because it transfers food from its roots to its leaves.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Look at this monster.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
(Music)

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
It's so basic. It just grows wild.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
That's what I really like about it,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
the fact that I haven't got to go and buy it,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
and it hasn't been genetically modified at all.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
It's just happening.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
And the X-ray shows how beautiful nature can be.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Not that that is particularly beautiful

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
when you look at it with the human eye,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
the way the leaves form. They're curling back on each other.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
So the X-ray will show the overlaps in these little corners.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
The thicker the object, the more radiation it needs,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
and the more time it needs.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
The lighter the object, the less radiation.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Sometimes you keep the time up, because the time gives you detail.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
The longer the exposure goes on for,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
the more detail you get.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
(Music)

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
If you look at this, just the tube,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
it is quite bright.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
But I could get a bit darker in the tube, but everything else would suffer.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
So, these leaves at the edge would start to disappear.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
What I like is how hard the edges are,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
how sharp.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Yeah, I'm quite pleased with it.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
(Music)

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
I travel beyond the surface and show

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
something for what it's worth,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
for what it's really made of, how it really works.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
But also I find that

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
I've got the benefit of taking away all the surface,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
which is things that people are used to seeing.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
And that's the sort of thing I've been doing.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
I've got the opportunity now to show you

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
what I'm going to be doing in the future.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
This is a commercial application of my most recent work.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
And what's good about this, I think, is that it's like a moment in time,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
like you've turned around, you've got X-ray vision

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
and you've taken a picture with the X-ray camera.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Unfortunately I haven't got X-ray vision.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
I do dream in X-ray. I see my projects in my sleep.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
And I know what they're going to look like in X-ray and I'm not far off.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
So, what am I doing in the future?

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Well, this year is the 50th anniversary

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
of Issigonis's Mini, which is one of my favorite cars.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
So, I've taken it apart, component by component,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
months and months and months of work.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
And with this image, I'm going to be displaying

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
it in the Victoria and Albert Museum

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
as a light box, which is actually attached to the car.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
So, I've got to saw the car in half, down the middle,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
not an easy task, in itself.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
And then, so you can get in the driver's side, sit down,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
and up against you is a wall.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
And if you get out and walk around to the other side of the car,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
you see a life-sized light box of the car showing you how it works.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
And I'm going to take that idea

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
and apply it to other sort of iconic things from my life.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Like, my first computer was a big movement in my life.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
And I had a Mac Classic. And it's a little box.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
And I think that would look quite neat as an X-ray.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
I'm also looking to

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
take my work from the two-dimensional form

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
to a more three-dimensional form.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
And this is quite a good way of doing it.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
I'm also working now with X-ray video.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
So, if you can imagine, some of these flowers,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
and they're actually moving and growing

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
and you can film that in X-ray, should be quite stunning.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
But that's it. I'm done. Thank you very much.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
(Applause)
