00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Something called the Danish Twin Study

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
established that only about 10 percent

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
of how long the average person lives,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
within certain biological limits, is dictated by our genes.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The other 90 percent is dictated by our lifestyle.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So the premise of Blue Zones: if we can find the

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
optimal lifestyle of longevity

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
we can come up with a de facto formula

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
for longevity.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
But if you ask the average American what the optimal formula

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
of longevity is, they probably couldn't tell you.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
They've probably heard of the South Beach Diet, or the Atkins Diet.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
You have the USDA food pyramid.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
There is what Oprah tells us.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
There is what Doctor Oz tells us.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
The fact of the matter is there is a lot of confusion

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
around what really helps us live longer better.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Should you be running marathons or doing yoga?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Should you eat organic meats

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
or should you be eating tofu?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
When it comes to supplements, should you be taking them?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
How about these hormones or resveratrol?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And does purpose play into it?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Spirituality? And how about how we socialize?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Well, our approach to finding longevity

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
was to team up with National Geographic,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and the National Institute on Aging,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
to find the four demographically confirmed areas

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
that are geographically defined.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And then bring a team of experts in there

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
to methodically go through exactly what these people do,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
to distill down the cross-cultural distillation.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And at the end of this I'm going to tell you what that distillation is.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
But first I'd like to debunk some common myths

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
when it comes to longevity.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And the first myth is if you try really hard

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
you can live to be 100.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
False.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
The problem is, only about one out of 5,000 people

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
in America live to be 100.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Your chances are very low.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Even though it's the fastest growing demographic in America,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
it's hard to reach 100.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
The problem is

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
that we're not programmed for longevity.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
We are programmed for something called

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
procreative success.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I love that word.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
It reminds me of my college days.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Biologists term procreative success to mean

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
the age where you have children

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and then another generation, the age when your children have children.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
After that the effect of evolution

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
completely dissipates.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
If you're a mammal, if you're a rat

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
or an elephant, or a human, in between, it's the same story.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
So to make it to age 100, you not only have to have

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
had a very good lifestyle, you also have to have won

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
the genetic lottery.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
The second myth is,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
there are treatments that can help slow,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
reverse, or even stop aging.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
False.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
When you think of it, there is 99 things that can age us.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Deprive your brain of oxygen for just a few minutes,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
those brain cells die, they never come back.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Play tennis too hard, on your knees, ruin your cartilage,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
the cartilage never comes back.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Our arteries can clog. Our brains can gunk up with plaque,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and we can get Alzheimer's.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
There is just too many things to go wrong.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Our bodies have 35 trillion cells,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
trillion with a "T." We're talking national debt numbers here.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
(Laughter)

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Those cells turn themselves over once every eight years.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
And every time they turn themselves over

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
there is some damage. And that damage builds up.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And it builds up exponentially.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
It's a little bit like the days when we all had

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Beatles albums or Eagles albums

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
and we'd make a copy of that on a cassette tape,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
and let our friends copy that cassette tape,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and pretty soon, with successive generations

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
that tape sounds like garbage.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Well, the same things happen to our cells.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
That's why a 65-year-old person

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
is aging at a rate of about

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
125 times faster

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
than a 12-year-old person.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
So, if there is nothing you can do

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
to slow your aging or stop your aging,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
what am I doing here?

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Well, the fact of the matter is

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
the best science tells us that the capacity of the human body,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
my body, your body,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
is about 90 years,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
a little bit more for women.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
But life expectancy in this country

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
is only 78.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
So somewhere along the line,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
we're leaving about 12 good years on the table.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
These are years that we could get.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.000
And research shows that they would be years largely free of chronic disease,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
heart disease, cancer and diabetes.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
We think the best way to get these missing years

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
is to look at the cultures around the world

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
that are actually experiencing them,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
areas where people are living to age 100

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
at rates up to 10 times greater than we are,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
areas where the life expectancy

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
is an extra dozen years,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
the rate of middle age mortality is a fraction

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
of what it is in this country.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
We found our first Blue Zone about 125 miles

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
off the coast of Italy, on the island of Sardinia.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And not the entire island, the island is about 1.4 million people,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
but only up in the highlands, an area called the Nuoro province.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
And here we have this area where men live the longest,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
about 10 times more centenarians than we have here in America.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And this is a place where people not only reach age 100,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
they do so with extraordinary vigor.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Places where 102 year olds still ride their bike to work,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.000
chop wood, and can beat a guy 60 years younger than them.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
(Laughter)

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Their history actually goes back to about the time of Christ.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
It's actually a Bronze Age culture that's been isolated.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Because the land is so infertile,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
they largely are shepherds,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
which occasions regular, low-intensity physical activity.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Their diet is mostly plant-based,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
accentuated with foods that they can carry into the fields.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
They came up with an unleavened whole wheat bread

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
called carta musica made out of durum wheat,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
a type of cheese made from grass-fed animals

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
so the cheese is high in Omega-3 fatty acids

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
instead of Omega-6 fatty acids from corn-fed animals,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
and a type of wine that has three times the level

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
of polyphenols than any known wine in the world.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
It's called Cannonau.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
But the real secret I think lies more

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
in the way that they organize their society.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
And one of the most salient elements of the Sardinian society

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
is how they treat older people.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
You ever notice here in America, social equity

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
seems to peak at about age 24?

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Just look at the advertisements.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Here in Sardinia, the older you get

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
the more equity you have,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
the more wisdom you're celebrated for.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
You go into the bars in Sardinia,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
instead of seeing the Sports Illustrated swimsuit calendar,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
you see the centenarian of the month calendar.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
This, as it turns out, is not only good for your aging parents

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
to keep them close to the family --

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
it imparts about four to six years of extra life expectancy --

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
research shows it's also good for the children of those families,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
who have lower rates of mortality and lower rates of disease.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
That's called the grandmother effect.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
We found our second Blue Zone

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
on the other side of the planet,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
about 800 miles south of Tokyo,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
on the archipelago of Okinawa.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Okinawa is actually 161 small islands.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
And in the northern part of the main island,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
this is ground zero for world longevity.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.000
This is a place where the oldest living female population is found.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
It's a place where people have the longest disability-free

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
life expectancy in the world.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
They have what we want.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
They live a long time, and tend to die in their sleep,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
very quickly,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
and often, I can tell you, after sex.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
They live about seven good years longer than the average American.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Five times as many centenarians as we have in America.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
One fifth the rate of colon and breast cancer,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
big killers here in America.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
And one sixth the rate of cardiovascular disease.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
And the fact that this culture has yielded these numbers

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
suggests strongly they have something to teach us.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
What do they do?

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Once again, a plant-based diet,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
full of vegetables with lots of color in them.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
And they eat about eight times as much tofu

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
as Americans do.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
More significant than what they eat is how they eat it.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
They have all kinds of little strategies

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
to keep from overeating,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
which, as you know, is a big problem here in America.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
A few of the strategies we observed:

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
they eat off of smaller plates, so they tend to eat fewer calories at every sitting.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Instead of serving family style,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
where you can sort of mindlessly eat as you're talking,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
they serve at the counter, put the food away,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
and then bring it to the table.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
They also have a 3,000-year-old adage,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
which I think is the greatest sort of diet suggestion ever invented.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
It was invented by Confucius.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
And that diet is known as the Hara, Hatchi, Bu diet.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
It's simply a little saying these people say before their meal

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
to remind them to stop eating when their stomach is [80] percent full.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
It takes about a half hour for that full feeling

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
to travel from your belly to your brain.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
And by remembering to stop at 80 percent

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
it helps keep you from doing that very thing.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
But, like Sardinia, Okinawa has a few social constructs

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
that we can associate with longevity.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
We know that isolation kills.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Fifteen years ago, the average American had three good friends.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
We're down to one and half right now.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
If you were lucky enough to be born in Okinawa,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
you were born into a system where you

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
automatically have a half a dozen friends

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
with whom you travel through life.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
They call it a Moai. And if you're in a Moai

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
you're expected to share the bounty if you encounter luck,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
and if things go bad,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
child gets sick, parent dies,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
you always have somebody who has your back.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
This particular Moai, these five ladies

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
have been together for 97 years.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Their average age is 102.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Typically in America

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
we've divided our adult life up into two sections.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
There is our work life,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
where we're productive.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
And then one day, boom, we retire.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
And typically that has meant

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
retiring to the easy chair,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
or going down to Arizona to play golf.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
In the Okinawan language there is not even

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
a word for retirement.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Instead there is one word

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
that imbues your entire life,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
and that word is "ikigai."

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
And, roughly translated, it means

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
"the reason for which you wake up in the morning."

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
For this 102-year-old karate master,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
his ikigai was carrying forth this martial art.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
For this hundred-year-old fisherman

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
it was continuing to catch fish for his family three times a week.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
And this is a question. The National Institute on Aging

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
actually gave us a questionnaire to give these centenarians.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
And one of the questions, they were very culturally astute,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
the people who put the questionnaire.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
One of the questions was, "What is your ikigai?"

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000
They instantly knew why they woke up in the morning.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
For this 102 year old woman, her ikigai

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000
was simply her great-great-great-granddaughter.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Two girls separated in age by 101 and a half years.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
And I asked her what it felt like

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
to hold a great-great-great-granddaughter.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
And she put her head back and she said,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
"It feels like leaping into heaven."

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
I thought that was a wonderful thought.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
My editor at Geographic

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
wanted me to find America's Blue Zone.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
And for a while we looked on the prairies of Minnesota,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
where actually there is a very high proportion of centenarians.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
But that's because all the young people left.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
(Laughter)

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
So, we turned to the data again.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
And we found America's longest-lived population

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
among the Seventh-Day Adventists

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000
concentrated in and around Loma Linda, California.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Adventists are conservative Methodists.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
They celebrate their Sabbath

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
from sunset on Friday till sunset on Saturday.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
A "24-hour sanctuary in time," they call it.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
And they follow five little habits

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
that conveys to them extraordinary longevity,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
comparatively speaking.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
In America here, life expectancy

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
for the average woman is 80.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
But for an Adventist woman,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
their life expectancy is 89.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
And the difference is even more pronounced among men,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
who are expected to live about 11 years

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
longer than their American counterparts.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Now, this is a study that followed

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
about 70,000 people for 30 years.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Sterling study. And I think it supremely illustrates

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
the premise of this Blue Zone project.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
This is a heterogeneous community.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
It's white, black, Hispanic, Asian.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
The only thing that they have in common are a set of

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
very small lifestyle habits

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
that they follow ritualistically

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
for most of their lives.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
They take their diet directly from the Bible.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Genesis: Chapter one, Verse [29],

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
where God talks about legumes and seeds,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
and on one more stanza about green plants,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
ostensibly missing is meat.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
They take this sanctuary in time very serious.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
For 24 hours every week,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
no matter how busy they are, how stressed out they are at work,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
where the kids need to be driven,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
they stop everything and they focus on their God,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
their social network, and then, hardwired right in the religion,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
are nature walks.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
And the power of this is not that it's done occasionally,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
the power is it's done every week for a lifetime.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
None of it's hard. None of it costs money.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Adventists also tend to hang out with other Adventists.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
So, if you go to an Adventist's party

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
you don't see people swilling Jim Beam or rolling a joint.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Instead they're talking about their next nature walk,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
exchanging recipes, and yes, they pray.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000
But they influence each other in profound and measurable ways.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
This is a culture that has yielded Ellsworth Whareham.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Ellsworth Whareham is 97 years old.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
He's a multimillionaire,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
yet when a contractor wanted 6,000 dollars

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
to build a privacy fence,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
he said, "For that kind of money I'll do it myself."

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
So for the next three days he was out shoveling cement,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
and hauling poles around.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
And predictably, perhaps, on the fourth day

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000
he ended up in the operating room.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
But not as the guy on the table;

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
the guy doing open-heart surgery.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.000
At 97 he still does 20 open-heart surgeries every month.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Ed Rawlings, 103 years old now,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
an active cowboy, starts his morning with a swim.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
And on weekends he likes to put on the boards,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
throw up rooster tails.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
And then Marge Deton.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Marge is 104.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Her grandson actually lives in the Twin Cities here.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
She starts her day with lifting weights.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
She rides her bicycle.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
And then she gets in her root-beer colored

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
1994 Cadillac Seville,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
and tears down the San Bernardino freeway,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
where she still volunteers for seven different organizations.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
I've been on 19 hardcore expeditions.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
I'm probably the only person you'll ever meet

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
who rode his bicycle across

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
the Sahara desert without sunscreen.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
But I'll tell you, there is no adventure more harrowing

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
than riding shotgun with Marge Deton.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000
"A stranger is a friend I haven't met yet!" she'd say to me.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
So, what are the common denominators

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
in these three cultures?

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
What are the things that they all do?

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
And we managed to boil it down to nine.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
In fact we've done two more Blue Zone expeditions since this

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
and these common denominators hold true.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
And the first one,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
and I'm about to utter a heresy here,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
none of them exercise,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
at least the way we think of exercise.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Instead, they set up their lives

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
so that they are constantly nudged into physical activity.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
These 100-year-old Okinawan women

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
are getting up and down off the ground, they sit on the floor,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
30 or 40 times a day.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Sardinians live in vertical houses, up and down the stairs.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
Every trip to the store, or to church

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
or to a friend's house occasions a walk.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
They don't have any conveniences.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
There is not a button to push to do yard work or house work.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
If they want to mix up a cake, they're doing it by hand.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
That's physical activity.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
That burns calories just as much as going on the treadmill does.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
When they do do intentional physical activity,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
it's the things they enjoy. They tend to walk,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
the only proven way to stave off cognitive decline,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
and they all tend to have a garden.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
They know how to set up their life in the right way

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
so they have the right outlook.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Each of these cultures take time to downshift.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
The Sardinians pray. The Seventh-Day Adventists pray.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
The Okinawans have this ancestor veneration.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
But when you're in a hurry or stressed out,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
that triggers something called the inflammatory response,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
which is associated with everything from Alzheimer's

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.000
disease to cardiovascular disease.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
When you slow down for 15 minutes a day

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
you turn that inflammatory state

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
into a more anti-inflammatory state.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
They have vocabulary for sense of purpose,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
ikigai, like the Okinawans.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
You know the two most dangerous years in your life

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000
are the year you're born, because of infant mortality,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
and the year you retire.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
These people know their sense of purpose,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
and they activate in their life, that's worth about seven years

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
of extra life expectancy.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
There's no longevity diet.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Instead, these people drink a little bit every day,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
not a hard sell to the American population.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.000
(Laughter)

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
They tend to eat a plant-based diet.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Doesn't mean they don't eat meat, but lots of beans and nuts.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
And they have strategies to keep from overeating,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
little things that nudge them away from the table at the right time.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
And then the foundation of all this is how they connect.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
They put their families first,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
take care of their children and their aging parents.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
They all tend to belong to a faith-based community,

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
which is worth between four and 14

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
extra years of life expectancy

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
if you do it four times a month.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
And the biggest thing here

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
is they also belong to the right tribe.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
They were either born into

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000
or they proactively surrounded themselves with the right people.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
We know from the Framingham studies,

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
that if your three best friends are obese

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
there is a 50 percent better chance that you'll be overweight.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
So, if you hang out with unhealthy people,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
that's going to have a measurable impact over time.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Instead, if your friend's idea of recreation

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
is physical activity, bowling, or playing hockey,

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
biking or gardening,

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
if your friends drink a little, but not too much,

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000
and they eat right, and they're engaged, and they're trusting and trustworthy,

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
that is going to have the biggest impact over time.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
Diets don't work. No diet in the history of the world

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
has ever worked for more than two percent of the population.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
Exercise programs usually start in January;

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
they're usually done by October.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
When it comes to longevity

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
there is no short term fix

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
in a pill or anything else.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
But when you think about it,

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
your friends are long-term adventures,

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
and therefore, perhaps the most significant thing you can do

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
to add more years to your life,

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
and life to your years. Thank you very much.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.000
