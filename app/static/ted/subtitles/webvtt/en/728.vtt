00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I want you to put off your preconceptions,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
your preconceived fears and thoughts about reptiles.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Because that is the only way I'm going to get my story across to you.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And by the way, if I come across as a sort of

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
rabid, hippie conservationist,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
it's purely a figment of your imagination.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
(Laughter)

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Okay. We are actually the first species on Earth

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
to be so prolific to actually threaten our own survival.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And I know we've all seen images enough to make us numb,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
of the tragedies that we're perpetrating on the planet.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
We're kind of like greedy kids, using it all up, aren't we?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And today is a time for me to talk to you about water.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
It's not only because we like to drink lots of it,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and its marvelous derivatives, beer, wine, etc.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And, of course, watch it fall from the sky

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and flow in our wonderful rivers,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
but for several other reasons as well.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
When I was a kid, growing up in New York,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I was smitten by snakes, the same way most kids are

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
smitten by tops, marbles, cars, trains, cricket balls.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And my mother, brave lady,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
was partly to blame,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
taking me to the New York Natural History Museum,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
buying me books on snakes,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and then starting this infamous career of mine,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
which has culminated in

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
of course, arriving in India 60 years ago,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
brought by my mother, Doris Norden,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and my stepfather, Rama Chattopadhyaya.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
It's been a roller coaster ride.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Two animals, two iconic reptiles

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
really captivated me very early on.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
One of them was the remarkable gharial.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
This crocodile, which grows to almost 20 feet long

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
in the northern rivers,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and this charismatic snake, the king cobra.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
What my purpose of the talk today really is,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
is to sort of indelibly scar your minds

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
with these charismatic and majestic creatures.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Because this is what you will take away from here,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
a reconnection with nature, I hope.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
The king cobra is quite remarkable for several reasons.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
What you're seeing here is very recently shot images

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
in a forest nearby here,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
of a female king cobra making her nest.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Here is a limbless animal, capable of gathering a huge mound of leaves,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and then laying her eggs inside,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
to withstand 5 to 10 [meters of rainfall],

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
in order that the eggs can incubate over the next 90 days,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and hatch into little baby king cobras.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
So, she protects her eggs,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and after three months,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
the babies finally do hatch out.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
A majority of them will die, of course. There is very high mortality

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
in little baby reptiles who are just 10 to 12 inches long.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
My first experience with king cobras was in '72

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
at a magical place called Agumbe,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
in Karnataka, this state.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And it is a marvelous rain forest.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
This first encounter

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
was kind of like the

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Maasai boy who kills the lion to become a warrior.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
It really changed my life totally.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
And it brought me straight into the conservation fray.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
I ended up starting this research

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and education station in Agumbe,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
which you are all of course invited to visit.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
This is basically a base wherein

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
we are trying to gather and learn

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
virtually everything about the biodiversity

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
of this incredibly complex forest system,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and try to hang on to what's there,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
make sure the water sources are protected and kept clean,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and of course, having a good time too.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
You can almost hear the drums

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
throbbing back in that little cottage where we stay when we're there.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
It was very important for us to get through to the people.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And through the children is usually the way to go.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
They are fascinated with snakes. They haven't got

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
that steely thing that you end up

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
either fearing or hating or despising or loathing them in some way.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
They are interested.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And it really works to start with them.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
This gives you an idea of the size of some of these snakes.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
This is an average size king cobra, about 12 feet long.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
And it actually crawled into somebody's bathroom,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
and was hanging around there for two or three days.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
The people of this part of India

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
worship the king cobra.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And they didn't kill it. They called us to catch it.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Now we've caught more than 100 king cobras

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
over the last three years,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
and relocated them in nearby forests.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
But in order to find out the real secrets of these creatures

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
[it was necessary] for us to actually insert

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
a small radio transmitter inside [each] snake.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Now we are able to follow them and find out their secrets,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
where the babies go after they hatch,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
and remarkable things like this you're about to see.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
This was just a few days ago in Agumbe.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
I had the pleasure of being close to this large king cobra

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
who had caught a venomous pit viper.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And it does it in such a way that it doesn't get bitten itself.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
And king cobras feed only on snakes.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
This [little snake] was kind of a tid-bit for it,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
what we'd call a "vadai" or a donut or something like that.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
(Laughter)

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Usually they eat something a bit larger.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
In this case a rather strange and inexplicable

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
activity happened over the last breeding season,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
wherein a large male king cobra actually grabbed a female king cobra,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
didn't mate with it, actually killed it and swallowed it.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
We're still trying to explain and come to terms with

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000
what is the evolutionary advantage of this.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
But they do also a lot of other remarkable things.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
This is again, something [we were able to see] by virtue of the fact

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
that we had a radio transmitter in one of the snakes.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
This male snake, 12 feet long, met another male king cobra.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
And they did this incredible ritual combat dance.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
It's very much like the rutting of mammals, including humans,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
you know, sorting out our differences, but gentler, no biting allowed.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
It's just a wresting match,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
but a remarkable activity.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Now, what are we doing with all this information?

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
What's the point of all this?

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Well, the king cobra is literally

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
a keystone species in these rainforests.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And our job is to convince the authorities

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
that these forests have to be protected.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
And this is one of the ways we do it,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
by learning as much as we can

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
about something so remarkable and so iconic in the rainforests there,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
in order to help protect trees, animals

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
and of course the water sources.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
You've all heard, perhaps, of Project Tiger

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
which started back in the early '70s,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
which was, in fact, a very dynamic time for conservation.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
We were piloted, I could say,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
by a highly autocratic stateswoman,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
but who also had an incredible passion for environment.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
And this is the time when Project Tiger emerged.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And, just like Project Tiger,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
our activities with the king cobra

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
is to look at a species of animal

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
so that we protect its habitat and everything within it.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
So, the tiger is the icon.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
And now the king cobra is a new one.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
All the major rivers in south India

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
are sourced in the Western Ghats,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
the chain of hills running along the west coast of India.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
It pours out millions of gallons every hour,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
and supplies drinking water to at least 300 million people,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
and washes many, many babies,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
and of course feeds many, many animals,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
both domestic and wild,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
produces thousands of tons of rice.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
And what do we do? How do we respond to this?

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Well, basically, we dam it, we pollute it,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
we pour in pesticides, weedicides, fungicides.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
You drink it in peril of your life.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
And the thing is, it's not just big industry.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
It's not misguided river engineers

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
who are doing all this; it's us.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
It seems that our citizens find the best way to dispose of garbage

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
are in water sources.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Okay. Now we're going north, very far north.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
North central India, the Chambal River

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
is where we have our base.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
This is the home of the gharial, this incredible crocodile.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
It is an animal which has been on the Earth

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
for just about 100 million years.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
It survived even during the time that the dinosaurs died off.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
It has remarkable features.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Even though it grows to 20 feet long,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
since it eats only fish it's not dangerous to human beings.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
It does have big teeth, however,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
and it's kind of hard to convince people

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
if an animal has big teeth, that it's a harmless creature.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
But we, actually, back in the early '70s,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
did surveys,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
and found that gharial were extremely rare.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
In fact, if you see the map,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
the range of their original habitat

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
was all the way from the Indus in Pakistan

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
to the Irrawaddy in Burma.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
And now it's just limited to a couple of spots

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
in Nepal and India.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
So, in fact at this point

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
there are only 200 breeding gharial left in the wild.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
So, starting in the mid-'70s

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
when conservation was at the fore,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
we were actually able to start projects which were

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
basically government supported

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
to collect eggs from the wild from the few remaining nests

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
and release 5,000 baby gharial

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
back to the wild.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
And pretty soon we were seeing sights like this.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
I mean, just incredible to see bunches of gharial

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
basking on the river again.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
But complacency does have a tendency to breed contempt.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
And, sure enough, with all the other pressures on the river,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
like sand mining, for example,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
very, very heavy cultivation all the way down to the river's edge,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
not allowing the animals to breed anymore,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
we're looking at

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
even more problems building up for the gharial,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
despite the early good intentions.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Their nests hatching along the riverside

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
producing hundreds of hatchlings. It's just an amazing sight.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
This was actually just taken last year.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
But then the monsoon arrives,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
and unfortunately downriver there is always a dam or

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
there is always a barrage,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000
and, shoop, they get washed down to their doom.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Luckily there is still a lot of interest.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
My pals in the Crocodile Specialist Group of the IUCN,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
the [Madras Crocodile Bank], an NGO,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
the World Wildlife Fund,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
the Wildlife Institute of India, State Forest Departments,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
and the Ministry of Environment, we all work together on stuff.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
But it's possibly, and definitely not enough.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000
For example, in the winter of 2007 and 2008,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
there was this incredible die-off of gharial, in the Chambal River.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Suddenly dozens of gharial appearing on the river, dead.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Why? How could it happen?

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
This is a relatively clean river.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
The Chambal, if you look at it, has clear water.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
People scoop water out of the Chambal and drink it,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
something you wouldn't do in most north Indian rivers.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
So, in order to try to find out the answer to this,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
we got veterinarians from all over the world

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
working with Indian vets to try to figure out what was happening.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
I was there for a lot of the necropsies on the riverside.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
And we actually looked through

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
all their organs and tried to figure out what was going on.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
And it came down to something called gout,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
which, as a result of kidney breakdown

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
is actually uric acid crystals throughout the body,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
and worse in the joints,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
which made the gharial unable to swim.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
And it's a horribly painful death.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Just downriver from the Chambal is the

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
filthy Yamuna river, the sacred Yamuna river.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
And I hate to be so ironic and sarcastic about it

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
but it's the truth. It's just one of the filthiest cesspools you can imagine.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
It flows down through Delhi, Mathura, Agra,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
and gets just about every bit of effluent you can imagine.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
So, it seemed that the toxin that was killing the gharial

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
was something in the food chain,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
something in the fish they were eating.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
And, you know, once a toxin is in the food chain

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
everything is affected, including us.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Because these rivers are the lifeblood of people all along their course.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
In order to try to answer some of these questions,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
we again turn to technology,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
to biological technology, in this case,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
again, telemetry, putting radios on 10 gharial,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
and actually following their movements. They're being watched

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
everyday as we speak, to try to find out

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
what this mysterious toxin is.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
The Chambal river is an absolutely incredible place.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
It's a place that's famous to a lot of you who know

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
about the bandits, the dacoits

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
who used to work up there. And there still are quite a few around.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
But Poolan Devi was one [of them]. Which actually Shekhar Kapur

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
made an incredible movie, "The Bandit Queen," which I urge you to see.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
You'll get to see the incredible [Chambal] landscape as well.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
But, again, heavy fishing pressures.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
This is one of the last repositories of the

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Ganges river dolphin,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
various species of turtles,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
thousands of migratory birds,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
and fishing is causing problems like this.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
And now [these] new elements of human intolerance

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
for river creatures like the gharial

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
means that if they don't drown in the net,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
then they simply cut their beaks off.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Animals like the Ganges river dolphin

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
which is just down to a few left,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
and it is also critically endangered.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
So, who is next? Us?

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Because we are all dependent on these water sources.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
So, we all know about the Narmada river,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
the tragedies of dams, the tragedies of huge projects

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
which displace people and wreck river systems

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
without providing livelihoods.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
And development just basically going berserk,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
for a double figure growth index, basically.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
So, we're not sure where this story is going to end,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
whether it's got a happy or sad ending.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
And climate change is certainly going

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
to turn all of our theories and predictions on their heads.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
We're still working hard at it.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
We've got a lot of a good team of people working up there.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
And the thing is, you know, the decision makers,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
the folks in power,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
they're up in their bungalows and so on in Delhi,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
in the city capitals. They are all supplied with plenty of water. It's cool.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
But out on the rivers there are still millions of people

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
who are in really bad shape.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
And it's a bleak future for them.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
So, we have our Ganges and Yamuna cleanup project.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
We've spent hundreds of millions of dollars on it,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
and nothing to show for it. Incredible.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
So, people talk about political will.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
During the die-off of the gharial we did galvanize a lot of action.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Government cut through all the red tape,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
we got foreign vets on it. It was great.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
So, we can do it.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
But if you stroll down to the Yamuna

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
or to the Gomati in Lucknow,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
or to the Adyar river in Chennai,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
or the Mula-Mutha river in Pune,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
just see what we're capable of doing to a river. It's sad.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
But I think the final note really is

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
that we can do it.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
The corporates, the artists, the wildlife nuts,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
the good old everyday folks

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
can actually bring these rivers back.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
And the final word is

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
that there is a king cobra looking over our shoulders.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
And there is a gharial looking at us from the river.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
And these are powerful water totems.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
And they are going to disturb our dreams until we do the right thing.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Namaste.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:21.000
(Applause)

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Chris Anderson: Thanks, Rom. Thanks a lot.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
You know, most people are terrified of snakes.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
And there might be quite a few people here who would be

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
very glad to see the last king cobra bite the dust.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Do you have those conversations with people?

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
How do you really get them to care?

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Romulus Whitaker: I take the sort of humble approach,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
I guess you could say. I don't say that snakes are huggable exactly.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
It's not like the teddy bear.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000
But I sort of -- there is an innocence in these animals.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
And when the average person looks at a cobra

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
going "Ssssss!" like that, they say, "My god,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
look at that angry, dangerous creature."

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
I look at it as a creature who is totally frightened

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
of something so dangerous as a human being.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
And that is the truth. And that's what I try to get out.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
(Applause)

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
CA: Now, incredible footage you showed of the viper being killed.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
You were saying that that hasn't been filmed before.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
RW: Yes, this is actually the first time anyone of us knew about it, for one thing.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
As I said, it's just like a little snack for him, you know?

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Usually they eat larger snakes like rat snakes,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
or even cobras.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
But this guy who we're following right now is in the deep jungle.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Whereas other king cobras

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
very often come into the human interface,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
you know, the plantations, to find big rat snakes and stuff.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
This guy specializes in pit vipers.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
And the guy who is working there with them,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
he's from Maharashtra, he said, "I think he's after the nusha."

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
(Laughter)

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Now, the nusha means the high.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Whenever he eats the pit viper he gets this little venom rush.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
(Laughter)

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
CA: Thanks Rom. Thank you.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
(Applause)
