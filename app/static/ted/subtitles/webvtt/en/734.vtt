00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Hi. For those of you who haven't seen dancing bears,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
these are the dancing bears.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
In 1995, we started working on a two-year investigative research project

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
to try and find out what was going on.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Because the sloth bears in the wild were obviously getting depleted

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
because of this.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
This is the Qalandar community. They are a marginalized Islamic community

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
who live across India,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and have been in India since the 13th century.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We went about getting evidence of what was going on.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And this is footage from a hidden camera in a button.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And we went in, pretending to be buyers.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And we found this right in this very state, in Karnataka.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And the bear cubs were being harvested from across the country

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and being sold and traded.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
These were being sold for about 2,000 dollars each,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and they are used for bear paw soup,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and also being trained, later on,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
to become dancing bears like the one you just saw.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Sadly, the family of Qalandars depended on this bear.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The couple are barely 18 years old.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
They already have four children beside them. You can see them.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And the economy of the family and their livelihood depended on those animals.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So, we had to deal with it in a very practical and sustainable manner.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Now, when we started working deeper and digging deeper,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
we found that it's an illegal act.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
These guys could go to jail for up to seven years

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
if they were caught by authorities.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And what they were doing to the bears was really appalling.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
It was unacceptable.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
The mother bears are usually killed.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
The cubs, which are taken, are separated.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Their teeth are basically bashed out with a metal rod.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And they use a red hot iron needle to make a hole through the muzzle.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Now we had to start changing these people and converting them from using that

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
for a livelihood, to getting something else.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
So, this is Bitu Qalandar, who was our first experiment.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And we were so unsure that this would work.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
We weren't sure at all. And we managed to convince him.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And we said, "Okay, here is some seed fund.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Let's see if you can get something else." And we got the bear surrendered

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
to -- we set up a sanctuary. We have four sanctuaries in India.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And now he sells cool drinks, he's by the highway.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
He has a telephone booth.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And then it started, there was no turning back after that.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
This is Sadua who came and surrendered his bear.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And now he runs a cattle fodder store and a grain store

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
near Agra.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Then there was no looking back at all for us.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
We gave cycle rickshaws.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
We set up carpet-weaving units,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
vocational training for the women.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
The women were just not allowed to come out of the community

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and work with mainstream society. So, we were able to address that.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Education. The kids never went to school.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
They only had Islamic education, very little of it.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And they were never allowed to go to school

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
because they were an extra earning hand at home. So we managed to get education.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
So, we sponsor 600 children education programs today.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
We were able to ensure brighter futures for these people.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Of course we also had to get the bears in.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
This is what happens to the bears when they come in.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And this is what we turn them into.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
We have a veterinary facility in our rescue centers.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
So, basically in 2002 there were

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
1,200 dancing bears.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
We rescued over 550 dancing bears.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
We've been able to ensure better futures for the people and the bears.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
The big news that I want to announce today

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
is that next month we will be bringing in

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
the very last bear of India,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
into our rescue center.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
(Applause)

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And India will no longer have to witness this cruel barbaric practice

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
which has been here for centuries.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
And the people can hold their heads up high.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
And the Qalandar people will rise above all this cruel barbaric past

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
that they've lived all their lives.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And the beautiful bears can of course live in the wild again.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And there will be no more removing of these bears.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And the children, both humans and bear cubs

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
can live peacefully. Thank you.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000
(Applause)
