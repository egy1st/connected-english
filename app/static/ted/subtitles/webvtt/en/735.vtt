00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Contagious is a good word.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Even in the times of H1N1, I like the word.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Laughter is contagious. Passion is contagious.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Inspiration is contagious.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We've heard some remarkable stories from some remarkable speakers.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
But for me, what was contagious about all of them

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
was that they were infected by something I call the

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
"I Can" bug.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So, the question is, why only them?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
In a country of a billion people and some,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
why so few?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Is it luck? Is it chance?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Can we all not systematically and consciously

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
get infected?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So, in the next eight minutes I would like to share with you my story.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I got infected when I was 17,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
when, as a student of the design college,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I encountered adults who actually believed in my ideas,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
challenged me and had lots of cups of chai with me.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And I was struck by just how wonderful it felt,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and how contagious that feeling was.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I also realized I should have got infected when I was seven.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So, when I started Riverside school 10 years ago it became a lab,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
a lab to prototype and refine a design process

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
that could consciously infect the mind with the "I Can" bug.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And I uncovered

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
that if learning is embedded in real-world context,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
that if you blur the boundaries between school and life,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
then children go through a journey of "aware,"

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
where they can see the change,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
"enable," be changed,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and then "empower," lead the change.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And that directly increased student wellbeing.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Children became more competent,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and less helpless.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
But this was all common sense.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
So, I'd like to show you a little glimpse of what

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
common practice looks like at Riverside.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
A little background: when my grade five was learning about child rights,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
they were made to roll incense sticks,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
agarbattis, for eight hours

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
to experience what it means to be a child laborer.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
It transformed them. What you will see is their journey,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and then their utter conviction

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
that they could go out and change the world.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
(Music)

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
That's them rolling.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And in two hours, after their backs were broke,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
they were changed.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And once that happened,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
they were out in the city convincing everybody

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
that child labor just had to be abolished.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And look at Ragav, that moment when his face changes

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
because he's been able to understand that he

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
has shifted that man's mindset.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And that can't happen in a classroom.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
So, when Ragav experienced that

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
he went from "teacher told me,"

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
to "I am doing it." And that's the "I Can" mindshift.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And it is a process that can be energized and nurtured.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
But we had parents who said,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
"Okay, making our children good human beings is all very well,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
but what about math and science and English?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Show us the grades."

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And we did. The data was conclusive.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
When children are empowered,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
not only do they do good,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
they do well, in fact very well,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
as you can see in this national benchmarking assessment

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
taken by over 2,000 schools in India,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Riverside children were outperforming the top 10 schools in India

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
in math, English and science.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
So, it worked. It was now time to take it outside Riverside.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
So, on August 15th, Independence Day, 2007,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
the children of Riverside set out to infect Ahmedabad.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Now it was not about Riverside school.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
It was about all children. So, we were shameless.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
We walked into the offices of the municipal corporation, the police,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
the press, businesses,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
and basically said, "When are you going to wake up

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
and recognize the potential that resides in every child?

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
When will you include the child in the city?

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Basically, open your hearts and your minds to the child."

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
So, how did the city respond?

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Since 2007 every other month

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
the city closes down the busiest streets for traffic

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
and converts it into a playground for children and childhood.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Here was a city telling its child, "You can."

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
A glimpse of infection in Ahmedabad.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Video: [Unclear]

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
So, the busiest streets closed down.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
We have the traffic police and municipal corporation helping us.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
It gets taken over by children.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
They are skating. They are doing street plays.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
They are playing, all free, for all children.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:47.000
(Music)

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Atul Karwal: aProCh is an organization which has been doing things for kids earlier.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
And we plan to extend this to other parts of the city.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
(Music)

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Kiran Bir Sethi: And the city will give free time.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
And Ahmedabad got the first child-friendly zebra crossing in the world.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Geet Sethi: When a city gives to the children,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
in the future the children will give back to the city.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
(Music)

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
KBS: And because of that,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Ahmedabad is known as India's first child-friendly city.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
So, you're getting the pattern. First 200 children at Riverside.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Then 30,000 children in Ahmedabad, and growing.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
It was time now to infect India.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
So, on August 15th,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
again, Independence Day, 2009,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
empowered with the same process,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
we empowered 100,000 children to say, "I can."

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
How? We designed a simple toolkit,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
converted it into eight languages,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
and reached 32,000 schools.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
We basically gave children a very simple challenge.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
We said, take one idea,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
anything that bothers you,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
choose one week,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
and change a billion lives.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And they did. Stories of change

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
poured in from all over India,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
from Nagaland in the east,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
to Jhunjhunu in the west,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
from Sikkim in the north, to Krishnagiri in the south.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Children were designing solutions for a diverse range of problems.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Right from loneliness to filling potholes in the street

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
to alcoholism,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
and 32 children who stopped 16 child marriages

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
in Rajasthan.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
I mean, it was incredible.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Basically again reaffirming that when adults believe in children

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
and say, "You can," then they will.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Infection in India.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
This is in Rajasthan, a rural village.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Child: Our parents are illiterate and we want to teach them how to read and write.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
KBS: First time, a rally and a street play in a rural school --

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
unheard of -- to tell their parents why literacy is important.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Look at what their parents says.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Man: This program is wonderful.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
We feel so nice that our children can teach us how to read and write.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Woman: I am so happy that my students did this campaign.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
In the future, I will never doubt my students' abilities.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
See? They have done it.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
KBS: An inner city school in Hyderabad.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Girl: 581. This house is 581 ...

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
We have to start collecting from 555.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
KBS: Girls and boys in Hyderabad, going out,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
pretty difficult, but they did it.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Woman: Even though they are so young, they have done such good work.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000
First they have cleaned the society, then it will be Hyderabad, and soon India.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Woman: It was a revelation for me. It doesn't strike me

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
that they had so much inside them.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Girl: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
For our auction we have some wonderful paintings for you,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
for a very good cause,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
the money you give us will be used to buy hearing aids.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Are you ready, ladies and gentlemen? Audience: Yes!

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Girl: Are you ready? Audience: Yes!

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Girl: Are you ready? Audience: Yes!

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
KBS: So, the charter of compassion starts right here.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Street plays, auctions, petitions.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
I mean, they were changing lives.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
It was incredible.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
So, how can we still stay immune?

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
How can we stay immune to that passion, that energy, that excitement?

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
I know it's obvious,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
but I have to end with the most powerful symbol of change, Gandhiji.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
70 years ago, it took one man

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
to infect an entire nation

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
with the power of "We can."

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
So, today who is it going to take

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
to spread the infection from 100,000 children

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
to the 200 million children in India?

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Last I heard, the preamble still said, "We, the people of India," right?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
So, if not us, then who?

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
If not now, then when?

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Like I said, contagious is a good word.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Thank you.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:10.000
(Applause)
