00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.000
In 2008, Cyclone Nargis devastated Myanmar.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Millions of people were in severe need of help.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The U.N. wanted to rush people and supplies to the area.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
But there were no maps, no maps of roads,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
no maps showing hospitals, no way for help to reach the cyclone victims.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
When we look at a map of Los Angeles or London,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
it is hard to believe

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
that as of 2005, only 15 percent of the world

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
was mapped to a geo-codable level of detail.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The U.N. ran headfirst into a problem

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
that the majority of the world's populous faces:

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
not having detailed maps.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
But help was coming.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
At Google, 40 volunteers

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
used a new software

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
to map 120,000 kilometers of roads,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
3,000 hospitals, logistics and relief points.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And it took them four days.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
The new software they used? Google Mapmaker.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Google Mapmaker is a technology that empowers each of us

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
to map what we know locally.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
People have used this software

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
to map everything from roads to rivers,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
from schools to local businesses,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and video stores to the corner store.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Maps matter.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Nobel Prize nominee Hernando De Soto

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
recognized that the key to economic liftoff

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
for most developing countries

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
is to tap the vast amounts of uncapitalized land.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
For example, a trillion dollars

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
of real estate remains uncapitalized in India alone.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
In the last year alone,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
thousands of users in 170 countries

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
have mapped millions of pieces of information,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and created a map of a level of detail never thought viable.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
And this was made possible by

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
the power of passionate users everywhere.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Let's look at some of the maps

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
being created by users right now.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
So, as we speak, people are mapping the world

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
in these 170 countries.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
You can see Bridget in Africa who just mapped a road in Senegal.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And, closer to home, Chalua, an N.G. road in Bangalore.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
This is the result of computational geometry,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
gesture recognition, and machine learning.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
This is a victory of thousands of users,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
in hundreds of cities,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
one user, one edit at a time.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
This is an invitation to the 70 percent

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
of our unmapped planet.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Welcome to the new world.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
