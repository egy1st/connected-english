00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I am going to be talking about secrets.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Obviously the best way to divulge a secret

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
is to tell someone to not say anything about it.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
(Laughter)

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Secrets. I'm using PowerPoint this year

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
just because, you know, I'm into the TED thing.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
(Laughter)

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And when you use these things you don't have to go like that.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
You just press it.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
(Laughter)

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Oh, man. Um, yes.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
(Laughter)

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Yes. I'm sure! Just change it!

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
(Laughter)

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Is Bill Gates here?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Change it! Come on! What?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
(Laughter)

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Ah! Okay.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
That's not my slides, but it's okay.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
(Laughter)

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
As you can see, these are all maps.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And maps are important devices for transferring information,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
especially if you have human cognitive ability.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
We can see that all formulas are really maps.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Now, as humans, we make maps of places

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
that we seldom even go,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
which seems a little wasteful of time.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
This, of course, is a map of the moon.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
There're some very delightful names.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Tranquilacalitis, [unclear]. My favorite is Frigoris.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
What are these people thinking? Frigoris?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
What the Frigoris you doing? Names are important.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Frigoris? This is the Moon. People could live there one day.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I'll meet you at Frigoris. No. I don't think so.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
(Laughter)

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
There we see Mars, again with various names.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And this is all done, by the way,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
by the International Astronomical Union.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
This is an actual group of people

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
that sit around naming planetary objects.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
This is from their actual book.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
These are some of the names that they have chosen, ladies and gentlemen.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I'll go through a little of them. Bolotnitsa.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
That, of course, is the Slavic swamp mermaid.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
(Laughter)

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Now I think the whole concept of a mermaid

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
doesn't really blend into the swamp feel.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
(Laughter)

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
"Oh look! Mermaid come out of swamp. Oh boy!

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
It's time for Bolotnitsa!"

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
(Laughter)

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Djabran Fluctus.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
If that don't flow off the tongue, what does?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
(Laughter)

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I mean kids are studying this stuff

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and they've got the word "fluctus" up there. That's wrong.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
(Laughter)

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
One dyslexic kid and he could be ruining his life.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
(Laughter)

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
"It fluctus up, Mama."

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Hikuleo Fluctus.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
That's a little more flowing. Hikuleo

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
sounds like a kind of a Leonardo DiCaprio

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
17 syllable thing.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And that's the Tonga underworld.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And one of my favorites is the Itoki Fluctus,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
who is the Nicaraguan goddess of insects, stars, and planets.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Now, if you're a goddess of stars and planets

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
wouldn't you relegate insects to somebody else?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000
(Laughter)

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
"No, no, really, I'm so busy with the stars.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Would you mind taking the insects? Thank you darling.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Oh take the spiders too. I know they're not insects, but I don't care.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Monkeys, chimps, just get rid of the hairy creatures."

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
(Laughter)

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Now, we're going to be going to Mars one day. And when we do,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
it's going to be unfair for the people that are living there

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
to have to live with these ridiculous names.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
So, you'll be on Mars, and you're at

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Hellespointica Depressio

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
which has got to be a really "up" place.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
(Laughter)

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Yeah, I'm at the Depressio, and I want to get over to Amazonis

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
so I plug it into the Mars map,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and click the button and there's my directions.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
I go to Chrysokeras.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
(Laughter) Left to the Thymiamata.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Then to Niliacus Lacus,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
which is not a bad name.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Niliacus Lacus, try to get the practice, slick-a-tick-a-bacus.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
That's a cool name. I will say that.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
So, I hold back a little of my venom

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
for these astronomical misnomers.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And then of course Arnon to Thoth.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And of course there will be advertisements.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
This is from their rule book, the International Astronomical Union.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
And you know they're international because

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
they put it "en Francais" as well.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
L'Union Astronomique Internationale,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
for those of you who don't speak French.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
I thought I'd translate for you.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
From the rulebook: Nomenclature is a tool.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
The first consideration, make it clear, simple and unambiguous.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And I think that Djabran Fluctus,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
that fits that mode.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
(Laughter)

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
That's simple, the goddess of goats, very simple.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Djabran Fluctus.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
"Now, Frank is this clear to you, Djabran Fluctus?"

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
"Yeah, that's the goat goddess right? The Abacazanian?

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000
(Laughter)

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
It's clear to me."

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
"Listen, I'm going back to the swamp mermaid. Can you call me in a little while?"

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
(Laughter)

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Also, from the actual document

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
I highlighted a part I thought may be of interest.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Anyone can suggest changing a name.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
So, I look to you, fellow member of the Earth community.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
We've got to change this stuff up fast.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
So, these are actual names of people that work there.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
I did some more investigation.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
These are more people working for this group.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
And, as you can see, they don't use their first names.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000
(Laughter)

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
These are people naming planets, and they won't use their first names.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Something is askew here.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000
(Laughter)

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Is it because his name is really Jupiter Blunck?

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
(Laughter)

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Is that Ganymede Andromeda Burba?

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000
(Laughter)

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Is that Mars Ya Marov?

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
I don't know. But it's investigative material, no doubt.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
There are some mapping people who do use their names.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Witness please, Eugene Shoemaker,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
who, diligently, from a young boy

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
decided he wanted to make maps of celestial bodies.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Must have been a very interesting day in the Shoemaker house.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
"Mom, I want to make maps."

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
"That's wonderful Eugene. You could make maps of Toronto."

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
"No, I want to make maps of planets."

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
"Yeah, go to your room."

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
(Laughter)

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Martians, Venusians, Jovians.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
We have names for places where people don't exist.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
That seems a little silly to me.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
There are no Jovians.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Getting back to my premise, I used stamps, by the way,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
because you don't have to pay anybody for the rights.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
(Laughter)

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000
(Applause)

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
There is obviously Einstein, Niels Bohr,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
de Fermat's last theorem, and I'm not sure whether that's James Coburn

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
or Richard Harris.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
(Laughter)

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
It's definitely one of the two. I'm not really clear which one.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
But obviously the point is that numbers are maps.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
And within numbers, is there an underlying secret to the universe?

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
That is the premise of this particular presentation.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
By the way, that's a natural picture of Saturn,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
no adjustments. I mean that's just beautiful.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
So beautiful that I will even give up a laugh

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
to explain my love of this particular planet,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and the day Saturday, named after it, wonderfully.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
So, formulas relate number to form.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
That's Euler, his formula

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
was one of the inspirations that lead to the beginning of string theory

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
which is kind of cool, not that funny, but it is cool.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
(Laughter)

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
He was also famous for having no body.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
(Laughter)

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Which a lot of you are like, "How did he figure that out?"

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
He's got no body, no man, just a head floating high.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Here comes Euler.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
(Laughter)

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
And that's an icosahedron,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
which is one of the five sacred solids, very important shapes.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
You see the icosahedron again.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
The dodecahedron, it's dual.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
There is a dodecahedron which I had to do in my room last night.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
The five sacred solids, as you can see there.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Which is not to be confused with the five sacred salads.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
(Laughter)

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Blue cheese, ranch, oil and vinegar, thousand islands and house.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
I suggest the house.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
The reality, now here is something important.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
What's important about this is

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
these shapes are duals of each other.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
And you can see how the icosahedron

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
withdraws into the dodecahedron

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
and then they just merge into each other.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
So, the whole concept of branes in the universe,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
if the universe is shaped like a dodecahedron

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
this is a very good map of what could possibly be.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
And that is, of course, what we are here to talk about.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
What a coincidence!

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
October 9th, in France, Jean-Pierre Luminet

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
said that the universe is probably shaped like a dodecahedron,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
based on information that they got from this probe.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
This would be a normal wave pattern.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
But what they're seeing, way out there in the far reaches

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
of the microwave background,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
is this kind of odd undulation.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
It doesn't plug in to what they suspected a flat universe would be.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
So, you can kind of get an idea from this

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
extrapolating that back under this huge picture,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
so we get this idea of what the primal universe looked like.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
And judging from this, it looks a little like a cheeseburger.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
(Laughter)

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
So, I'm thinking the universe is either a dodecahedron or a cheeseburger.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And for me, that's a win-win.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Everybody goes, I'm happy.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000
(Laughter)

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Better really hurry up.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
I just threw this in because

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
as important as all of our intellectual abilities are,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
without heart and without love it's just -- it's all meaningless.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And that, to me, is really beautiful.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000
(Laughter)

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Except for that creepy guy in the background.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
(Laughter)

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Getting back to the point of my particular presentation,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Kepler, one of my great heroes,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
who realized that these five solids, which I spoke of earlier,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
were related somehow to the planets,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
but he couldn't prove it. It freaked him out.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
But it did lead to Newton discovering gravity.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
So, maps of things leading to organized understandings

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
of the universe in which we emerge.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Now this is Isaac from a Vietnamese stamp.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
(Laughter)

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
I am not suggesting at all that my Vietnamese brothers and sisters

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
could maybe use a little art class here and there. But ...

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000
(Laughter)

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
that's not a good picture.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
(Laughter)

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Not a good picture. Now, my friends in the island of Nevis

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
are a little better. Look at that! That's Isaac Newton.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
That guy is rockin'.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000
(Laughter)

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
What a handsome cat.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Once again, Nicaragua let me down.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
(Laughter)

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
And Copernicus looks like Johnny Carson, which is really weird.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000
(Laughter)

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
I don't get that at all.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Once again, these guys rock it out.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Isaac is kickin' ass. Man, he looks like a rock star.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
This is freaky is a major way.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
This is Sierra Leone.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
They got little babies in there, floating in there.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000
(Laughter)

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Man. I don't really need to comment on this.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
But I didn't know that Isaac Newton was in the Moody Blues. Did you?

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
(Laughter)

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
When did this happen?

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000
(Laughter)

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
It's a different kind of course. And they've got five apples?

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
I mean these guys are extrapolating in realms

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
that are not necessarily valid.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Although five is a good number, of course.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Ecuador, my friend Kepler,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
as you can see, they call him Juan.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
(Laughter)

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Juan? No! Johannes, not Juan.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
It wasn't Carlos Chaplain. It's wrong.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
(Laughter)

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
René Descartes, of course. Once again

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
these Grenada people, this is like way too sick

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
for anybody's imagination.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
He's all murky. There is little kids leaning on his leg,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
little ghosts flying around. We gotta clean this stuff up

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
fast, ladies and gentlemen.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.000
(Laughter)

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
This is, of course, the Cartesian coordinates.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Once again, that's Sierra Leone.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
This is again, indicating how numbers

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
relate to space relate to form, maps of the universe.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Because that's why we're here, really, I think to figure stuff out and to love each other.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Descartes. (Laughter)

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Before the horse. (Laughter)

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Now, Monaco took Descartes, and just flipped him around.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Now, Monaco is problematic for me, and I'll show you why.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Here is a map. All they have is a casino on it.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
(Laughter)

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
And why Franklin Delano Roosevelt is on their map

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
I don't even want to hazard a guess.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
But I'd say he'd been to Hellespointica Depressio recently.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000
(Laughter)

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
This is the flag of Monaco. Ladies and gentlemen,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
the flag of Indonesia. Please examine.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
(Laughter)

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
(Applause)

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Not sure how this came to be, but it's not right.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
In Monaco, "No, what are you talking about?

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
They are so different.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Look, ours is more red, it's longer.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
They stole our flag! They stole our flag!"

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
(Laughter)

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Bode's law wasn't even his law. It was a guy named Titus.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
And the reason I just bring this up because it is a law that doesn't really work.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
That's Jude Law and some of his films recently didn't work.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
(Laughter)

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Just a correlation that indicates how things are misinterpreted.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
And I wonder if the photographer said, "Okay, Jude,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
could you touch your tooth? That's good."

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Just a tip, if you're being photographed

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
for press pictures, don't touch your teeth.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
(Laughter)

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Prime numbers, Gauss, one of my favorites.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Golden section, I've been obsessed with this thing

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
since before I was born.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
I know that scares a lot of you,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
but that was my purpose entirely.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
There we can see Fibonacci numbers related to the Golden Section,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
because Fibonacci and Golden Section

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
relate to the unfolding of the measured meter of matter, as I refer to it.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
If Fibonacci had been on Paxil,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
(Laughter)

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
that would be the Fibonacci series.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
"Ten milligram, 20 milligram."

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
"Leonardo, dinner's ready, put down those books and take your pills."

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
"Yes, Mama."

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
(Laughter)

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Alright where is this going? That's a good question.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Here is the premise that I began 27 years ago.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
If numbers can express

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
the laws of this incredible universe that we live,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
I reason, through some sort of reverse engineering,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
we could extrapolate from them

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
some basic structural element of this universe.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
And that's what I did. Twenty-seven years ago

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
I started working on this.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000
And I tried to build a particle accelerator.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000
(Laughter)

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
And that didn't work out well.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
So, then I thought a calculator is a metaphor.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
I can just divide numbers, that's like atom smashing.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
That's what I did. That's how I found Moleeds.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Moleeds are what I believe

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
the thing that will allow string theory to be proved.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
They are the nodes on the string,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
patterns and relationships, 27, 37.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
That was the first chart I came up with.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
You can see, even if you don't go for the numbers,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
the beauty of the symmetry.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
The numbers from one to 36, divided into six groups.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Symmetry, pairs.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Every top adds up to 37.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Bottom, all 74.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
There is so many intricate relationships that I'm not going to go there now,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
because you would say, "Hey, go back to the Fluctus part."

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
(Laughter)

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Circle of Fifths, acoustic harmony, geometric symmetry.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000
I knew those two were related.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Once again, the Cartesian kind of cross-over.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
So, I said if I'm going to put a circle,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
see what kind of patterns I get, boom, the Red System.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Look at that. You can't just make this stuff up, ladies and gentlemen.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
(Laughter)

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
You can't just go around going, "Oh, I'm going to put some triangles in a circle

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
and they're going to be symmetrical. And they're all going to add up,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
and it's going to be, oh yeah, I figured that out."

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
This is beyond anything anybody could just make up.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
There is the Orange System.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.000
(Laughter)

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
And you'll see over here, these are multiples of the number 27.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
And they recapitulate that shape,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
even though that's a circle of nine and that's a circle of 36. It's nuts.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000
(Laughter)

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
That's the Green System. It all folds in half

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
on the Green System, right between 18 and 19.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
The Blue System. The Violet. It's all there.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:31.000
(Laughter)

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Look at that! I mean you cannot make that stuff up.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000
(Laughter)

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
That just doesn't fall out of a tree, ladies and gentlemen.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Twenty-seven years of my life!

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000
(Laughter)

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
And I'm presenting it here at TED. Why?

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Because this is the place if aliens land, I hope they come here.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000
(Laughter)

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
"We are going to destroy the Earth. Hmmm ... maybe not."

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
(Laughter)

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
In this last year I have found these subsequent systems

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
which allow for the mathematic possibilities

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
of the Calabi-Yau manifolds

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
in a way that doesn't necessitate these little hidden dimensions.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Which works mathematically, but it just doesn't seem God-like to me.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
It just seems like it's not sexy and elegant, it's hidden.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
I don't want hidden, I want to see it.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
(Laughter)

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
I found other pairs all have symmetry,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
even though, unlike the master one, their symmetry is split.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Unbelievable. This is like crazy.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Am I the only one that sees this?

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000
(Laughter)

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
You know, I didn't just draw this in a day, by the way.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
You know, try making some charts like this at home.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
You gotta be accurate! There's measurement involved, increments.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
These are maps, by the way.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Not stamps, but one day.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
(Laughter)

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
Okay, I'm getting to the punch. Golden Ratio, it's crazy.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
And look at this, built within it is the Golden Ratio.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
I start looking at that, and look at them again.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
They start looking like planets.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
I go to JPL.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
I look at the orbits of the planets.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
I find 18 examples of it in our solar system.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
I never told anybody. This is the first thing. This could be history.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000
(Laughter)

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
Kepler was right.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:15.000
(Laughter)

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Eighteen and 19, the middle of the Moleeds, 0.618 is the golden section.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
Multiply them together, 18.618 x 19.618 is 365.247.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Which is .005 different from the number of days in a year.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Hey, you can't make this up.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
(Laughter)

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
Thank you very much.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000
(Applause)

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
Thank you.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
(Applause)

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Thank you.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000
(Applause)
