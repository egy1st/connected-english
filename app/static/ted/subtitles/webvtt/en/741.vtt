00:00:00.468 --> 00:00:05.071
As a magician, I try to create images
that make people stop and think.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.976
I also try to challenge myself

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.976
to do things that doctors
say are not possible.

00:00:12.602 --> 00:00:16.976
I was buried alive
in New York City in a coffin,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.853
buried alive in a coffin
in April, 1999, for a week.

00:00:22.623 --> 00:00:25.123
I lived there with nothing but water.

00:00:26.162 --> 00:00:28.976
And it ended up being so much fun

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.976
that I decided I could pursue
doing more of these things.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.432
The next one is I froze myself
in a block of ice

00:00:36.456 --> 00:00:38.976
for three days and three nights
in New York City.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.697
That one was way more difficult
than I had expected.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.976
The one after that, I stood
on top of a hundred-foot pillar

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.976
for 36 hours.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.499
I began to hallucinate so hard

00:00:51.523 --> 00:00:55.226
that the buildings that were behind me
started to look like big animal heads.

00:00:56.202 --> 00:00:57.976
So, next I went to London.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.976
In London I lived
in a glass box for 44 days

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.976
with nothing but water.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
It was, for me, one of the most difficult
things I'd ever done,

00:01:07.024 --> 00:01:10.107
but it was also the most beautiful.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.976
There was so many skeptics,
especially the press in London,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.976
that they started flying cheeseburgers
on helicopters around my box to tempt me.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.031
(Laughter)

00:01:21.055 --> 00:01:23.976
So, I felt very validated

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.979
when the New England Journal of Medicine
actually used the research for science.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.976
My next pursuit was I wanted to see
how long I could go without breathing,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.417
like how long I could survive
with nothing, not even air.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.224
I didn't realize that it would become
the most amazing journey of my life.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.976
As a young magician,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.976
I was obsessed with Houdini
and his underwater challenges.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.976
So, I began, early on,
competing against the other kids,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.976
seeing how long I could stay underwater
while they went up and down to breathe,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.976
you know, five times,
while I stayed under on one breath.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.976
By the time I was a teenager,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.976
I was able to hold my breath
for three minutes and 30 seconds.

00:02:06.708 --> 00:02:09.859
I would later find out
that was Houdini's personal record.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.976
In 1987 I heard of a story

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.976
about a boy that fell through ice
and was trapped under a river.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.976
He was underneath,
not breathing for 45 minutes.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.976
When the rescue workers came,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.976
they resuscitated him
and there was no brain damage.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.303
His core temperature
had dropped to 77 degrees.

00:02:36.226 --> 00:02:38.976
As a magician,
I think everything is possible.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.191
And I think if something
is done by one person,

00:02:41.215 --> 00:02:43.704
it can be done by others.

00:02:43.728 --> 00:02:45.110
I started to think,

00:02:45.134 --> 00:02:48.842
if the boy could survive
without breathing for that long,

00:02:48.866 --> 00:02:50.730
there must be a way that I could do it.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.976
So, I met with a top neurosurgeon.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.214
And I asked him, how long
is it possible to go without breathing,

00:02:57.238 --> 00:02:59.618
like how long could I go without air?

00:02:59.642 --> 00:03:01.976
And he said to me that anything
over six minutes

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.210
you have a serious risk
of hypoxic brain damage.

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:10.850
So, I took that as a challenge, basically.

00:03:10.874 --> 00:03:11.976
(Laughter)

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.527
My first try, I figured
that I could do something similar,

00:03:18.595 --> 00:03:20.976
and I created a water tank,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.544
and I filled it with ice
and freezing cold water.

00:03:24.568 --> 00:03:26.976
And I stayed inside of that water tank

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.976
hoping my core temperature
would start to drop.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.403
And I was shivering.

00:03:31.427 --> 00:03:34.920
In my first attempt to hold my breath,
I couldn't even last a minute.

00:03:34.944 --> 00:03:37.458
So, I realized that was completely
not going to work.

00:03:38.723 --> 00:03:40.920
I went to talk to a doctor friend --

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:47.976
and I asked him, "How could I do that?"

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.429
"I want to hold my breath for a really
long time. How could it be done?"

00:03:51.453 --> 00:03:53.976
And he said, "David, you're a magician,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.976
create the illusion of not breathing,
it will be much easier."

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.653
(Laughter)

00:04:00.813 --> 00:04:04.976
So, he came up with this idea
of creating a rebreather,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.621
with a CO2 scrubber,

00:04:07.645 --> 00:04:11.976
which was basically
a tube from Home Depot,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.976
with a balloon duct-taped to it,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.976
that he thought we could put inside of me,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.976
and somehow be able to circulate
the air and rebreathe

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.566
with this thing in me.

00:04:24.518 --> 00:04:27.976
This is a little hard to watch.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.027
But this is that attempt.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.976
So, that clearly wasn't going to work.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.144
(Laughter)

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.976
Then I actually started thinking
about liquid breathing.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.976
There is a chemical
that's called perflubron.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.976
And it's so high in oxygen levels
that in theory you could breathe it.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.976
So, I got my hands on that chemical,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.976
filled the sink up with it,
and stuck my face in the sink

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.976
and tried to breathe that in,
which was really impossible.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.976
It's basically like trying
to breathe, as a doctor said,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.286
while having an elephant
standing on your chest.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.443
So, that idea disappeared.

00:05:11.467 --> 00:05:13.713
Then I started thinking,

00:05:13.737 --> 00:05:17.976
would it be possible to hook up
a heart/lung bypass machine

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.976
and have a surgery where it was
a tube going into my artery,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.503
and then appear to not breathe
while they were oxygenating my blood?

00:05:25.322 --> 00:05:28.511
Which was another insane idea, obviously.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.139
Then I thought about
the craziest idea of all the ideas:

00:05:34.527 --> 00:05:35.976
to actually do it.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.047
(Laughter)

00:05:37.071 --> 00:05:40.483
To actually try to hold
my breath past the point

00:05:40.507 --> 00:05:43.438
that doctors would
consider you brain dead.

00:05:45.768 --> 00:05:49.976
So, I started researching
into pearl divers.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.976
You know, because they go down
for four minutes on one breath.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.576
And when I was researching pearl divers,
I found the world of free-diving.

00:05:57.528 --> 00:06:01.480
It was the most amazing thing
that I ever discovered, pretty much.

00:06:02.596 --> 00:06:04.976
There is many different
aspects to free-diving.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.524
There is depth records,
where people go as deep as they can.

00:06:08.548 --> 00:06:10.448
And then there is static apnea.

00:06:10.472 --> 00:06:12.976
That's holding your breath
as long as you can

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.976
in one place without moving.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.976
That was the one that I studied.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.096
The first thing that I learned
is when you're holding your breath,

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.976
you should never move at all;
that wastes energy.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.639
And that depletes oxygen,

00:06:25.663 --> 00:06:27.502
and it builds up CO2 in your blood.

00:06:27.526 --> 00:06:29.394
So, I learned never to move.

00:06:29.418 --> 00:06:31.976
And I learned how to slow
my heart rate down.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.191
I had to remain
perfectly still and just relax

00:06:34.215 --> 00:06:37.976
and think that I wasn't in my body,
and just control that.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.976
And then I learned how to purge.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.453
Purging is basically hyperventilating.

00:06:42.477 --> 00:06:43.669
You blow in and out --

00:06:43.693 --> 00:06:47.976
(Breathing loudly)

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.977
You do that, you get lightheaded,
you get tingling.

00:06:51.001 --> 00:06:53.306
And you're really ridding
your body of CO2.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:56.583
So, when you hold your breath,
it's infinitely easier.

00:06:57.416 --> 00:07:01.019
Then I learned that you have
to take a huge breath,

00:07:01.152 --> 00:07:04.976
and just hold and relax
and never let any air out,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.495
and just hold and relax
through all the pain.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.565
Every morning, this is for months,

00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:13.429
I would wake up
and the first thing that I would do

00:07:13.453 --> 00:07:15.786
is I would hold my breath

00:07:15.826 --> 00:07:20.976
for, out of 52 minutes,
I would hold my breath for 44 minutes.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.191
So, basically what that means
is I would purge,

00:07:23.215 --> 00:07:25.076
I'd breathe really hard for a minute.

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.369
And I would hold, immediately after,
for five and a half minutes.

00:07:28.393 --> 00:07:31.976
Then I would breathe again for a minute,
purging as hard as I can,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.577
then immediately after that I would hold
again for five and a half minutes.

00:07:35.601 --> 00:07:38.512
I would repeat this process
eight times in a row.

00:07:38.536 --> 00:07:41.976
Out of 52 minutes, you're only
breathing for eight minutes.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.976
At the end of that
you're completely fried, your brain.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.191
You feel like you're walking
around in a daze.

00:07:47.215 --> 00:07:48.976
And you have these awful headaches.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.976
Basically, I'm not the best person
to talk to when I'm doing that stuff.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.334
I started learning
about the world-record holder.

00:07:55.358 --> 00:07:56.976
His name is Tom Sietas.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.976
And this guy is perfectly built
for holding his breath.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.976
He's six foot four. He's 160 pounds.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.976
And his total lung capacity
is twice the size of an average person.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.487
I'm six foot one, and fat.

00:08:13.577 --> 00:08:14.976
We'll say big-boned.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.976
(Laughter)

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.976
I had to drop 50 pounds in three months.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.510
So, everything that I put into my body,
I considered as medicine.

00:08:25.534 --> 00:08:29.976
Every bit of food was exactly
what it was for its nutritional value.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.976
I ate really small controlled portions
throughout the day.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.197
And I started to really adapt my body.

00:08:38.221 --> 00:08:40.363
[Individual results may vary]

00:08:40.387 --> 00:08:42.976
(Laughter)

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.625
The thinner I was, the longer
I was able to hold my breath.

00:08:46.649 --> 00:08:49.976
And by eating so well
and training so hard,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.500
my resting heart-rate dropped
to 38 beats per minute.

00:08:53.524 --> 00:08:55.728
Which is lower than most Olympic athletes.

00:08:57.041 --> 00:08:58.591
In four months of training,

00:08:58.615 --> 00:09:01.088
I was able to hold my breath
for over seven minutes.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.976
I wanted to try holding
my breath everywhere.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.334
I wanted to try it
in the most extreme situations

00:09:07.358 --> 00:09:11.653
to see if I could slow
my heart rate down under duress.

00:09:11.677 --> 00:09:14.120
(Laughter)

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.976
I decided that I was going
to break the world record

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.577
live on prime-time television.

00:09:20.601 --> 00:09:23.976
The world record was
eight minutes and 58 seconds,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.191
held by Tom Sietas, that guy
with the whale lungs I told you about.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.413
I assumed that I could put
a water tank at Lincoln Center

00:09:32.437 --> 00:09:35.976
and if I stayed there a week not eating,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.976
I would get comfortable in that situation
and I would slow my metabolism,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.143
which I was sure would help me
hold my breath

00:09:42.167 --> 00:09:43.936
longer than I had been able to do it.

00:09:44.762 --> 00:09:46.294
I was completely wrong.

00:09:47.436 --> 00:09:51.382
I entered the sphere a week
before the scheduled air date.

00:09:51.407 --> 00:09:54.129
And I thought everything
seemed to be on track.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.976
Two days before my big
breath-hold attempt, for the record,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.976
the producers of my television special

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:06.866
thought that just watching somebody
holding their breath, and almost drowning,

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:08.976
is too boring for television.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.976
(Laughter)

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.384
So, I had to add handcuffs,
while holding my breath, to escape from.

00:10:16.408 --> 00:10:18.232
This was a critical mistake.

00:10:19.408 --> 00:10:22.976
Because of the movement,
I was wasting oxygen.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.242
And by seven minutes I had gone
into these awful convulsions.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.734
By 7:08, I started to black out.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.976
And by seven minutes and 30 seconds,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.432
they had to pull my body out
and bring me back.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.976
I had failed on every level.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.976
(Laughter)

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.878
So, naturally, the only way out
of the slump that I could think of was,

00:10:54.959 --> 00:10:57.422
I decided to call Oprah.

00:10:57.446 --> 00:11:00.883
(Laughter)

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.976
I told her that I wanted to up the ante

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.976
and hold my breath longer
than any human being ever had.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.758
This was a different record.

00:11:08.782 --> 00:11:11.292
This was a pure O2 static apnea record

00:11:11.316 --> 00:11:14.721
that Guinness had set
the world record at 13 minutes.

00:11:16.268 --> 00:11:21.811
So, basically you breathe pure O2 first,
oxygenating your body, flushing out CO2,

00:11:21.835 --> 00:11:23.898
and you are able to hold much longer.

00:11:25.558 --> 00:11:29.984
I realized that my real competition
was the beaver.

00:11:30.008 --> 00:11:32.754
(Laughter)

00:11:35.975 --> 00:11:36.976
(Laughter ends)

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.976
In January of '08,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.617
Oprah gave me four months
to prepare and train.

00:11:42.665 --> 00:11:45.633
So, I would sleep
in a hypoxic tent every night.

00:11:45.657 --> 00:11:49.976
A hypoxic tent is a tent
that simulates altitude at 15,000 feet.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.673
So, it's like base camp, Everest.

00:11:52.697 --> 00:11:57.976
What that does is, you start building up
the red bloodcell count in your body,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.238
which helps you carry oxygen better.

00:12:01.261 --> 00:12:04.976
Every morning, again,
after getting out of that tent,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.976
your brain is completely wiped out.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.976
My first attempt on pure O2,
I was able to go up to 15 minutes.

00:12:12.639 --> 00:12:14.976
So, it was a pretty big success.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.048
The neurosurgeon
pulled me out of the water

00:12:17.072 --> 00:12:21.976
because in his mind, at 15 minutes
your brain is done, you're brain dead.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.339
So, he pulled me up, and I was fine.

00:12:25.603 --> 00:12:28.952
There was one person there
that was definitely not impressed.

00:12:29.762 --> 00:12:31.386
It was my ex-girlfriend.

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:34.870
While I was breaking the record
underwater for the first time,

00:12:34.894 --> 00:12:37.976
she was sifting through my Blackberry,
checking all my messages.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.976
(Laughter)

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.519
My brother had a picture of it.
It is really --

00:12:43.543 --> 00:12:45.155
(Laughter)

00:12:47.447 --> 00:12:48.448
(Laughter ends)

00:12:48.472 --> 00:12:52.976
I then announced that I was going
to go for Sietas' record, publicly.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.396
And what he did in response,
is he went on Regis and Kelly,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.977
and broke his old record.

00:13:00.001 --> 00:13:04.277
Then his main competitor
went out and broke his record.

00:13:04.301 --> 00:13:08.976
So, he suddenly pushed the record up to
16 minutes and 32 seconds.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.853
Which was three minutes
longer than I had prepared.

00:13:11.877 --> 00:13:13.376
It was longer than the record.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.976
I wanted to get the Science Times
to document this.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.976
I wanted to get them to do a piece on it.

00:13:21.578 --> 00:13:24.976
So, I did what any person

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.689
seriously pursuing scientific
advancement would do.

00:13:28.713 --> 00:13:32.976
I walked into the New York Times offices
and did card tricks to everybody.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.936
(Laughter)

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.381
So, I don't know if it was the magic
or the lure of the Cayman Islands,

00:13:40.405 --> 00:13:41.976
but John Tierney flew down

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.976
and did a piece on the seriousness
of breath-holding.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.524
While he was there,
I tried to impress him, of course.

00:13:47.548 --> 00:13:49.976
And I did a dive down to 160 feet,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.486
which is basically the height
of a 16 story building,

00:13:54.510 --> 00:13:56.976
and as I was coming up,
I blacked out underwater,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.286
which is really dangerous;
that's how you drown.

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:03.664
Luckily, Kirk had seen me
and he swam over and pulled me up.

00:14:03.688 --> 00:14:05.976
So, I started full focus.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.976
I completely trained to get
my breath-hold time up

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.976
for what I needed to do.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.286
But there was no way to prepare
for the live television aspect of it,

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:15.976
being on Oprah.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.649
But in practice, I would do it
face down, floating on the pool.

00:14:20.673 --> 00:14:26.357
But for TV they wanted me to be upright
so they could see my face, basically.

00:14:27.126 --> 00:14:30.976
The other problem
was the suit was so buoyant

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.976
that they had to strap my feet in
to keep me from floating up.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.976
So, I had to use my legs to hold my feet
into the straps that were loose,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.005
which was a real problem for me.

00:14:41.071 --> 00:14:44.976
That made me extremely nervous,
raising the heart rate.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.976
Then, what they also did was,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.419
which we never did before,
is there was a heart-rate monitor.

00:14:50.443 --> 00:14:52.976
And it was right next to the sphere.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.239
So, every time my heart would beat,
I'd hear the beep-beep-beep-beep,

00:14:56.263 --> 00:14:58.285
you know, the ticking, really loud.

00:14:58.309 --> 00:15:00.453
Which was making me more nervous.

00:15:00.477 --> 00:15:03.164
And there was no way to slow
my heart rate down.

00:15:05.204 --> 00:15:08.976
Normally, I would start
at 38 beats per minute,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.096
and while holding my breath,
it would drop to 12 beats per minute,

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.976
which is pretty unusual.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.381
(Laughter)

00:15:20.366 --> 00:15:25.137
This time it started at 120 beats,
and it never went down.

00:15:26.358 --> 00:15:28.976
I spent the first five minutes underwater

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.976
desperately trying to slow
my heart rate down.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.652
I was just sitting there thinking,

00:15:33.676 --> 00:15:36.364
"I've got to slow this down.
I'm going to fail."

00:15:36.388 --> 00:15:37.976
And I was getting more nervous.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.143
And the heart rate
just kept going up and up,

00:15:40.167 --> 00:15:42.053
all the way up to 150 beats.

00:15:44.987 --> 00:15:48.653
Basically it's the same thing that created
my downfall at Lincoln Center.

00:15:48.677 --> 00:15:50.034
It was a waste of O2.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.524
When I made it to the halfway
mark, at eight minutes,

00:15:53.548 --> 00:15:55.976
I was 100 percent certain

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.143
that I was not going
to be able to make this.

00:15:58.167 --> 00:16:00.312
There was no way for me to do it.

00:16:01.169 --> 00:16:03.976
I figured, Oprah had dedicated an hour

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.976
to doing this breath-hold thing,
if I had cracked early,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.976
it would be a whole show
about how depressed I am.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.976
(Laughter)

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.976
So, I figured I'm better off just fighting
and staying there until I black out,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.239
at least then they can pull me out
and take care of me and all that.

00:16:19.263 --> 00:16:22.372
(Laughter)

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.048
I kept pushing to 10 minutes.

00:16:25.072 --> 00:16:28.784
At 10 minutes you start getting all
these really strong tingling sensations

00:16:28.808 --> 00:16:30.388
in your fingers and toes.

00:16:30.412 --> 00:16:32.348
And I knew that that was blood shunting,

00:16:32.372 --> 00:16:34.866
when the blood rushes away
from your extremities

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:37.011
to provide oxygen to your vital organs.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.611
At 11 minutes I started feeling
throbbing sensations in my legs,

00:16:44.635 --> 00:16:47.976
and my lips started
to feel really strange.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.976
At minute 12 I started
to have ringing in my ears,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.976
and I started to feel my arm going numb.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.239
And I'm a hypochondriac, and I remember
arm numb means heart attack.

00:16:58.263 --> 00:17:00.976
So, I started to really
get really paranoid.

00:17:02.031 --> 00:17:04.942
Then at 13 minutes, maybe
because of the hypochondria,

00:17:04.966 --> 00:17:08.976
I started feeling pains all over my chest.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.053
It was awful.

00:17:10.077 --> 00:17:11.078
(Laughter)

00:17:11.102 --> 00:17:14.976
At 14 minutes,
I had these awful contractions,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.976
like this urge to breathe.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.642
(Laughter)

00:17:22.871 --> 00:17:23.871
(Laughter ends)

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.976
At 15 minutes I was suffering
major O2 deprivation to the heart.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.976
And I started having
ischemia to the heart.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.825
My heartbeat would go from 120 to 50,

00:17:35.849 --> 00:17:40.976
to 150, to 40, to 20, to 150 again.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.976
It would skip a beat.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.400
It would start. It would stop.
And I felt all this.

00:17:45.424 --> 00:17:48.091
And I was sure that I was going
to have a heart attack.

00:17:48.115 --> 00:17:50.976
So, at 16 minutes what I did
is I slid my feet out

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.564
because I knew that if I did go out,
if I did have a heart attack,

00:17:55.588 --> 00:17:58.395
they'd have to jump into the binding
and take my feet out

00:17:58.419 --> 00:17:59.562
before pulling me up.

00:17:59.586 --> 00:18:00.970
I was really nervous.

00:18:00.994 --> 00:18:03.648
I let my feet out,
and I started floating to the top.

00:18:03.672 --> 00:18:05.179
And I didn't take my head out.

00:18:05.203 --> 00:18:08.139
But I was just floating there
waiting for my heart to stop,

00:18:08.163 --> 00:18:09.163
just waiting.

00:18:09.187 --> 00:18:12.976
They had doctors with the "Pst,"
you know, sitting there waiting.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.543
And then suddenly I hear screaming.

00:18:15.567 --> 00:18:17.677
And I think that there
is some weird thing --

00:18:17.701 --> 00:18:19.976
that I had died or something had happened.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.976
And then I realized
that I had made it to 16:32.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.976
So, with the energy
of everybody that was there,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.976
I decided to keep pushing.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.446
And I went to 17 minutes and four seconds.

00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:34.876
(Applause)

00:18:39.244 --> 00:18:40.976
(Applause ends)

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.762
As though that wasn't enough,
what I did immediately after

00:18:43.786 --> 00:18:45.176
is I went to Quest Labs

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.704
and had them take every blood
sample that they could

00:18:47.728 --> 00:18:50.355
to test for everything
and to see where my levels were,

00:18:50.379 --> 00:18:52.369
so the doctors could use it, once again.

00:18:52.393 --> 00:18:54.409
I also didn't want anybody to question it.

00:18:54.433 --> 00:18:57.976
I had the world record and I wanted
to make sure it was legitimate.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.976
So, I get to New York City the next day,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.239
I'm walking out of the Apple store,

00:19:04.263 --> 00:19:06.511
and this kid walks up to me
he's like, "Yo, D!"

00:19:06.535 --> 00:19:07.976
I'm like "Yeah?"

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.976
He said, "If you really
held your breath that long,

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.976
why'd you come out of the water dry?"

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.976
I was like "What?"

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.976
(Laughter)

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.976
And that's my life. So --

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.132
(Laughter)

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.096
As a magician,
I try to show things to people

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:27.976
that seem impossible.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.481
And I think magic,

00:19:29.505 --> 00:19:32.976
whether I'm holding my breath
or shuffling a deck of cards,

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.976
is pretty simple.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.582
It's practice, it's training,
and it's -- (Sobs)

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:42.262
It's practice, it's training
and experimenting,

00:19:42.286 --> 00:19:43.557
(Sobs)

00:19:43.581 --> 00:19:46.710
while pushing through the pain
to be the best that I can be.

00:19:46.734 --> 00:19:50.143
And that's what magic
is to me, so, thank you.

00:19:50.167 --> 00:19:53.674
(Applause)
