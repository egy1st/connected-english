WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Right now is the most exciting time

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
to see new Indian art.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Contemporary artists in India are having a conversation with the world

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
like never before.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I thought it might be interesting, even for the many long-time

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
collectors here with us at TED, local collectors,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
to have an outside view of 10 young Indian artists

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I wish everyone at TED to know.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The first is Bharti Kher.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The central motif of Bharti's practice

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
is the ready-made store-bought bindi

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
that untold millions of Indian women apply to their foreheads,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
every day, in an act closely associated with

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
the institution of marriage.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
But originally the significance of the bindi

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
is to symbolize the third eye

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
between the spiritual world and the religious world.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Bharti seeks to liberate this everyday cliche, as she calls it,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
by exploding it into something spectacular.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
She also creates life-size fiberglass sculptures, often of animals,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
which she then completely covers in bindis,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
often with potent symbolism.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
She says she first got started with

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
10 packets of bindis,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and then wondered what she could do with 10 thousand.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Our next artist, Balasubramaniam,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
really stands at the crossroads of sculpture, painting and installation,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
working wonders with fiberglass.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Since Bala himself will be speaking at TED

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I won't spend too much time on him here today,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
except to say that he really succeeds

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
at making the invisible visible.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Brooklyn-based Chitra Ganesh

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
is known for her digital collages,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
using Indian comic books called amar chitra kathas

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
as her primary source material.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
These comics are a fundamental way

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
that children, especially in the diaspora,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
learn their religious and mythological folk tales.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I, for one, was steeped in these.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Chitra basically remixes and re-titles

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
these iconic images

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
to tease out some of the sexual and gender politics

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
embedded in these deeply influential comics.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And she uses this vocabulary in her installation work as well.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Jitish Kallat successfully practices across photography,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
sculpture, painting and installation.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
As you can see, he's heavily influenced

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
by graffiti and street art,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and his home city of Mumbai is an ever-present element in his work.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
He really captures that sense of density

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and energy which really characterizes modern urban Bombay.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
He also creates phantasmagoric sculptures

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
made of bones from cast resin.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Here he envisions the carcass

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
of an autorickshaw he once witnessed burning in a riot.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
This next artist, N.S. Harsha,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
actually has a studio right here in Mysore.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
He's putting a contemporary spin on the miniature tradition.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
He creates these fine, delicate images

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
which he then repeats on a massive scale.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
He uses scale to more and more spectacular effect,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
whether on the roof of a temple in Singapore,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
or in his increasingly ambitious installation work,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
here with 192 functioning sewing machines,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
fabricating the flags of every member of the United Nations.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Mumbai-based Dhruvi Acharya

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
builds on her love of comic books and street art

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
to comment on the roles and expectations

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
of modern Indian women.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
She too mines the rich source material of amar chitra kathas,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
but in a very different way than Chitra Ganesh.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
In this particular work, she actually strips out the images

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
and leaves the actual text

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
to reveal something previously unseen, and provocative.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Raqib Shaw is Kolkata-born,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Kashmir-raised,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and London-trained.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
He too is reinventing the miniature tradition.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
He creates these opulent tableaus inspired by Hieronymus Bosch,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
but also by the Kashmiri textiles of his youth.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
He actually applies metallic industrial paints to his work

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
using porcupine quills to get this rich detailed effect.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
I'm kind of cheating with this next artist

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
since Raqs Media Collective are really

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
three artists working together.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Raqs are probably the foremost practitioners

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
of multimedia art in India today,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
working across photography, video and installation.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
They frequently explore themes of globalization and urbanization,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
and their home of Delhi is a frequent element in their work.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Here, they invite the viewer to analyze a crime

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
looking at evidence and clues embedded

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
in five narratives on these five different screens,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
in which the city itself may have been the culprit.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
This next artist is probably the alpha male

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
of contemporary Indian art, Subodh Gupta.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
He was first known for creating giant photo-realistic canvases,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
paintings of everyday objects,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
the stainless steel kitchen vessels and tiffin containers

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
known to every Indian.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
He celebrates these local and mundane objects globally,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
and on a grander and grander scale,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
by incorporating them into ever more colossal

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
sculptures and installations.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And finally number 10, last and certainly not least,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Ranjani Shettar,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
who lives and works here in the state of Karnataka,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
creates ethereal sculptures and installations

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
that really marry the organic to the industrial,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
and brings, like Subodh, the local global.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
These are actually wires wrapped in muslin

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
and steeped in vegetable dye.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And she arranges them so that the viewer

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
actually has to navigate through the space,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
and interact with the objects.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And light and shadow are a very important part of her work.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
She also explores themes of consumerism,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
and the environment, such as in this work,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
where these basket-like objects look organic and woven,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and are woven,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
but with the strips of steel, salvaged from cars

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
that she found in a Bangalore junkyard.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
10 artists, six minutes, I know that was a lot to take in.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
But I can only hope I've whet your appetite

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
to go out and see and learn more

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
about the amazing things that are happening in art in India today.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Thank you very much for looking and listening.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000
(Applause)
