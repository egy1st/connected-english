00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This is actually a painting

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
that hangs at the Countway Library at Harvard Medical School.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And it shows the first time an organ was ever transplanted.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
In the front, you see, actually, Joe Murray

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
getting the patient ready for the transplant,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
while in the back room you see Hartwell Harrison,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the Chief of Urology at Harvard,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
actually harvesting the kidney.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The kidney was indeed the first organ

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
ever to be transplanted to the human.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
That was back in 1954,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
55 years ago.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Yet we're still dealing with a lot of the same challenges

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
as many decades ago.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Certainly many advances, many lives saved.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
But we have a major shortage of organs.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
In the last decade the number of patients

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
waiting for a transplant has doubled.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
While, at the same time, the actual number of transplants

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
has remained almost entirely flat.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
That really has to do with our aging population.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We're just getting older.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Medicine is doing a better job

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
of keeping us alive.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
But as we age, our organs tend to fail more.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So, that's a challenge,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
not just for organs but also for tissues.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Trying to replace pancreas,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
trying to replace nerves that can help us with Parkinson's.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
These are major issues.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
This is actually a very stunning statistic.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Every 30 seconds

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
a patient dies from diseases

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
that could be treated with tissue regeneration or replacement.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
So, what can we do about it?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
We've talked about stem cells tonight.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
That's a way to do it.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
But still ways to go to get stem cells into patients,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
in terms of actual therapies for organs.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Wouldn't it be great if our bodies could regenerate?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Wouldn't it be great if we could actually harness the power

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
of our bodies, to actually heal ourselves?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
It's not really that foreign of a concept, actually;

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
it happens on the Earth every day.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
This is actually a picture of a salamander.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Salamanders have this amazing capacity to regenerate.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
You see here a little video.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
This is actually a limb injury in this salamander.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And this is actually real photography,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
timed photography, showing how that limb regenerates

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
in a period of days.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
You see the scar form.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And that scar actually grows out

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
a new limb.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
So, salamanders can do it.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Why can't we? Why can't humans regenerate?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Actually, we can regenerate.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Your body has many organs

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and every single organ in your body

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
has a cell population

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
that's ready to take over at the time of injury. It happens every day.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
As you age, as you get older.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Your bones regenerate every 10 years.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Your skin regenerates every two weeks.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
So, your body is constantly regenerating.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
The challenge occurs when there is an injury.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
At the time of injury or disease,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
the body's first reaction

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
is to seal itself off from the rest of the body.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
It basically wants to fight off infection,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
and seal itself, whether it's organs inside your body,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
or your skin, the first reaction

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
is for scar tissue to move in,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
to seal itself off from the outside.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
So, how can we harness that power?

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
One of the ways that we do that

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
is actually by using smart biomaterials.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
How does this work? Well, on the left side here

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
you see a urethra which was injured.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
This is the channel that connects the bladder to the outside of the body.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And you see that it is injured.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
We basically found out that you can use these smart biomaterials

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
that you can actually use as a bridge.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
If you build that bridge, and you close off

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
from the outside environment,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
then you can create that bridge, and cells

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
that regenerate in your body,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
can then cross that bridge, and take that path.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
That's exactly what you see here.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
It's actually a smart biomaterial

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
that we used, to actually treat this patient.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
This was an injured urethra on the left side.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
We used that biomaterial in the middle.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And then, six months later on the right-hand side

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
you see this reengineered urethra.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Turns out your body can regenerate,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
but only for small distances.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
The maximum efficient distance for regeneration

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
is only about one centimeter.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
So, we can use these smart biomaterials

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
but only for about one centimeter

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
to bridge those gaps.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
So, we do regenerate, but for limited distances.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
What do we do now,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
if you have injury for larger organs?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
What do we do when we have injuries

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
for structures which are much larger

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
than one centimeter?

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Then we can start to use cells.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
The strategy here, is if a patient comes in to us

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
with a diseased or injured organ,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
you can take a very small piece of tissue from that organ,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
less than half the size of a postage stamp,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
you can then tease that tissue apart,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
and look at its basic components,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
the patient's own cells,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
you take those cells out,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
grow and expand those cells outside the body in large quantities,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
and then we then use scaffold materials.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
To the naked eye they look like a piece of your blouse,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
or your shirt, but actually

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
these materials are fairly complex

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
and they are designed to degrade once inside the body.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
It disintegrates a few months later.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
It's acting only as a cell delivery vehicle.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
It's bringing the cells into the body. It's allowing

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
the cells to regenerate new tissue,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
and once the tissue is regenerated the scaffold goes away.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And that's what we did for this piece of muscle.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
This is actually showing a piece of muscle and how we go through

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
the structures to actually engineer the muscle.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
We take the cells, we expand them,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
we place the cells on the scaffold,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
and we then place the scaffold back into the patient.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
But actually, before placing the scaffold into the patient,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
we actually exercise it.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
We want to make sure that we condition

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
this muscle, so that it knows what to do

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
once we put it into the patient.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
That's what you're seeing here. You're seeing

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
this muscle bio-reactor

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
actually exercising the muscle back and forth.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Okay. These are flat structures that we see here,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
the muscle.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
What about other structures?

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
This is actually an engineered blood vessel.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Very similar to what we just did, but a little bit more complex.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Here we take a scaffold,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
and we basically -- scaffold can be like a piece of paper here.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
And we can then tubularize this scaffold.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
And what we do is we, to make a blood vessel, same strategy.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
A blood vessel is made up of two different cell types.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
We take muscle cells, we paste,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
or coat the outside with these muscle cells,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
very much like baking a layer cake, if you will.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
You place the muscle cells on the outside.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
You place the vascular blood vessel lining cells on the inside.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
You now have your fully seeded scaffold.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
You're going to place this in an oven-like device.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
It has the same conditions as a human body,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
37 degrees centigrade,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
95 percent oxygen.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
You then exercise it, as what you saw on that tape.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
And on the right you actually see a carotid artery that was engineered.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
This is actually the artery that goes from your neck to your brain.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
And this is an X-ray showing you

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
the patent, functional blood vessel.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
More complex structures

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
such as blood vessels, urethras, which I showed you,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
they're definitely more complex

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
because you're introducing two different cell types.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
But they are really acting mostly as conduits.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
You're allowing fluid or air to go through

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
at steady states.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
They are not nearly as complex as hollow organs.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Hollow organs have a much higher degree of complexity,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
because you're asking these organs to act on demand.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
So, the bladder is one such organ.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Same strategy, we take a very small piece of the bladder,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
less than half the size of a postage stamp.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
We then tease the tissue apart

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
into its two individual cell components,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
muscle, and these bladder specialized cells.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
We grow the cells outside the body in large quantities.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
It takes about four weeks to grow these cells from the organ.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
We then take a scaffold that we shape like a bladder.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
We coat the inside with these bladder lining cells.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
We coat the outside with these muscle cells.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
We place it back into this oven-like device.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
From the time you take that piece of tissue, six to eight weeks later

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
you can put the organ right back into the patient.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
This actually shows the scaffold.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
The material is actually being coated with the cells.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
When we did the first clinical trial for these patients

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
we actually created the scaffold specifically for each patient.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
We brought patients in,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
six to eight weeks prior to their scheduled surgery, did X-rays,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
and we then composed a scaffold specifically for that patient's size

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
pelvic cavity.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
For the second phase of the trials

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
we just had different sizes, small, medium, large and extra-large.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
(Laughter)

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
It's true.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
And I'm sure everyone here wanted an extra-large. Right?

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
(Laughter)

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
So, bladders are definitely a little bit more complex

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
than the other structures.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
But there are other hollow organs that have added complexity to it.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
This is actually a heart valve, which we engineered.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And the way you engineer this heart valve is the same strategy.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
We take the scaffold, we seed it with cells,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
and you can now see here, the valve leaflets opening and closing.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
We exercise these prior to implantation.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Same strategy.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
And then the most complex are the solid organs.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
For solid organs, they're more complex

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
because you're using a lot more cells per centimeter.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
This is actually a simple solid organ like the ear.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
It's now being seeded with cartilage.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
That's the oven-like device;

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
once it's coated it gets placed there.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And then a few weeks later we can take out the cartilage scaffold.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
This is actually digits that we're engineering.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
These are being layered, one layer at a time,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
first the bone, we fill in the gaps with cartilage.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
We then start adding the muscle on top.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
And you start layering these solid structures.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Again, fairly more complex organs,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
but by far, the most complex solid organs

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
are actually the vascularized, highly vascularized,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
a lot of blood vessel supply,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
organs such as the heart,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
the liver, the kidneys.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
This is actually an example -- several strategies

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
to engineer solid organs.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
This is actually one of the strategies. We use a printer.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
And instead of using ink, we use -- you just saw an inkjet cartridge --

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
we just use cells.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
This is actually your typical desktop printer.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
It's actually printing this two chamber heart,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
one layer at a time.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
You see the heart coming out there. It takes about 40 minutes to print,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
and about four to six hours later

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
you see the muscle cells contract.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:15.000
(Applause)

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
This technology was developed by Tao Ju, who worked at our institute.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
And this is actually still, of course, experimental,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
not for use in patients.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Another strategy that we have followed

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
is actually to use decellularized organs.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
We actually take donor organs,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
organs that are discarded,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
and we then can use very mild detergents

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
to take all the cell elements out of these organs.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
So, for example on the left panel,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
top panel, you see a liver.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
We actually take the donor liver,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
we use very mild detergents,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
and we, by using these mild detergents, we take all the cells

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
out of the liver.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Two weeks later, we basically can lift this organ up,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
it feels like a liver,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
we can hold it like a liver,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
it looks like a liver, but it has no cells.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
All we are left with

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
is the skeleton, if you will, of the liver,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
all made up of collagen,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
a material that's in our bodies, that will not reject.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
We can use it from one patient to the next.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
We then take this vascular structure

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
and we can prove that we retain the blood vessel supply.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
You can see, actually that's a fluoroscopy.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
We're actually injecting contrast into the organ.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Now you can see it start. We're injecting the contrast into the organ

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
into this decellularized liver.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
And you can see the vascular tree that remains intact.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
We then take the cells, the vascular cells,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
blood vessel cells, we perfuse the vascular tree

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
with the patient's own cells.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
We perfuse the outside of the liver

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
with the patient's own liver cells.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
And we can then create functional livers.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
And that's actually what you're seeing.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
This is still experimental. But we are able to actually reproduce the functionality

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
of the liver structure, experimentally.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
For the kidney,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000
as I talked to you about the first painting that you saw,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
the first slide I showed you,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
90 percent of the patients on the transplant wait list

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
are waiting for a kidney, 90 percent.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
So, another strategy we're following

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
is actually to create wafers

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
that we stack together, like an accordion, if you will.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
So, we stack these wafers together, using the kidney cells.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
And then you can see these miniature kidneys that we've engineered.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
They are actually making urine.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Again, small structures, our challenge is how to make them larger,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
and that is something we're working on

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
right now at the institute.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
One of the things that I wanted to summarize for you then

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
is what is a strategy that we're going for in regenerative medicine.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
If at all possible,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
we really would like to use smart biomaterials

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
that we can just take off the shelf

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
and regenerate your organs.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
We are limited with distances right now,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
but our goal is actually to increase those distances over time.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
If we cannot use smart biomaterials,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
then we'd rather use your very own cells.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Why? Because they will not reject.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
We can take cells from you,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
create the structure, put it right back into you, they will not reject.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
And if possible, we'd rather use the cells from your very specific organ.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
If you present with a diseased wind pipe

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
we'd like to take cells from your windpipe.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
If you present with a diseased pancreas

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
we'd like to take cells from that organ.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Why? Because we'd rather take those cells

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
which already know that those are the cell types you want.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
A windpipe cell already knows it's a windpipe cell.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
We don't need to teach it to become another cell type.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
So, we prefer organ-specific cells.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
And today we can obtain cells from most every organ in your body,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
except for several which we still need stem cells for,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000
like heart, liver, nerve and pancreas.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
And for those we still need stem cells.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
If we cannot use stem cells from your body

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
then we'd like to use donor stem cells.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
And we prefer cells that will not reject

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
and will not form tumors.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
And we're working a lot with the stem cells that we

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
published on two years ago,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
stem cells from the amniotic fluid,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
and the placenta, which have those properties.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
So, at this point, I do want to tell you that

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
some of the major challenges we have.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
You know, I just showed you this presentation, everything looks so good,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
everything works. Actually no,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
these technologies really are not that easy.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Some of the work you saw today

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
was performed by over 700 researchers

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
at our institute across a 20-year time span.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
So, these are very tough technologies.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Once you get the formula right you can replicate it.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
But it takes a lot to get there.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
So, I always like to show this cartoon.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
This is how to stop a runaway stage.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
And there you see the stagecoach driver,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
and he goes, on the top panel,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
He goes A, B, C, D, E, F.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
He finally stops the runaway stage.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
And those are usually the basic scientists,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
The bottom is usually the surgeons.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
(Laughter)

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
I'm a surgeon so that's not that funny.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.000
(Laughter)

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
But actually method A is the correct approach.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
And what I mean by that is that anytime we've launched one of these technologies

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
to the clinic,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
we've made absolutely sure that we do everything we can

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
in the laboratory before we ever

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
launch these technologies to patients.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
And when we launch these technologies to patients

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000
we want to make sure that we ask ourselves a very tough question.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Are you ready to place this in your own loved one, your own child,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
your own family member, and then we proceed.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Because our main goal, of course,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
is first, to do no harm.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
I'm going to show you now, a very short clip,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
It's a five second clip of a patient

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
who received one of the engineered organs.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
We started implanting some of these structures

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
over 14 years ago.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
So, we have patients now walking around with organs,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
engineered organs, for over 10 years, as well.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
I'm going to show a clip of one young lady.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
She had a spina bifida defect, a spinal cord abnormality.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
She did not have a normal bladder. This is a segment from CNN.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
We are just taking five seconds.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000
This is a segment that Sanjay Gupta actually took care of.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Video: Kaitlyn M: I'm happy. I was always afraid

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
that I was going to have like, an accident or something.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
And now I can just go and

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
go out with my friends,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
go do whatever I want.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Anthony Atala: See, at the end of the day, the promise of regenerative medicine

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
is a single promise.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
And that is really very simple,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
to make our patients better.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Thank you for your attention.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
(Applause)
