00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Can geographic information

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
make you healthy?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
In 2001 I got hit by a train.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
My train was a heart attack.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I found myself in a hospital

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
in an intensive-care ward,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
recuperating from emergency surgery.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And I suddenly realized something:

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
that I was completely in the dark.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I started asking my questions, "Well, why me?"

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
"Why now?" "Why here?"

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
"Could my doctor have warned me?"

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So, what I want to do here in the few minutes I have with you

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
is really talk about what is the formula for life and good health.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Genetics, lifestyle and environment.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
That's going to sort of contain our risks,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and if we manage those risks

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
we're going to live a good life and a good healthy life.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Well, I understand the genetics and lifestyle part.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And you know why I understand that?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Because my physicians constantly

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
ask me questions about this.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Have you ever had to fill out those long,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
legal-size forms in your doctor's office?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I mean, if you're lucky enough you get to do it more than once, right?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
(Laughter)

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Do it over and over again. And they ask you questions

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
about your lifestyle and your family history,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
your medication history, your surgical history,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
your allergy history ... did I forget any history?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
But this part of the equation I didn't really get,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and I don't think my physicians

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
really get this part of the equation.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
What does that mean, my environment?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Well, it can mean a lot of things.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
This is my life. These are my life places.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
We all have these.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
While I'm talking I'd like you to also be thinking about:

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
How many places have you lived?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Just think about that, you know, wander through

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
your life thinking about this.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
You spend it at rest and you spend it at work.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And if you're like me, you're in an airplane a good portion of your time

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
traveling some place.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
So, it's not really simple

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
when somebody asks you, "Where do you live, where do you work,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and where do you spend all your time?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And where do you expose yourselves to risks

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
that maybe perhaps you don't even see?"

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Well, when I have done this on myself,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I always come to the conclusion

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
that I spend about 75 percent of my time

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
relatively in a small number of places.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And I don't wander far from that place

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
for a majority of my time,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
even though I'm an extensive global trekker.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Now, I'm going to take you on a little journey here.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I started off in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I don't know if anybody might hail from northeastern Pennsylvania,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
but this is where I spent my first 19 years

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
with my little young lungs.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
You know, breathing high concentrations here

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
of sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and methane gas,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
in unequal quantities -- 19 years of this.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And if you've been in that part of the country,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
this is what those piles of burning, smoldering coal waste look like.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
So then I decided to leave that part of the world,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
and I was going to go to the mid-west.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
OK, so I ended up in Louisville, Kentucky.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Well, I decided to be neighbors to a place called Rubbertown.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
They manufacture plastics. They use large quantities chloroprene

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
and benzene.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Okay, I spent 25 years, in my middle-age lungs now,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
breathing various concentrations of that.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And on a clear day it always looked like this, so you never saw it.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
It was insidious and it was really happening.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Then I decided I had to get really smart,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
I would take this job in the West Coast.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And I moved to Redlands California.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Very nice, and there

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
my older, senior lungs, as I like to call them,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000
I filled with particulate matter, carbon dioxide and very high doses of ozone.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Okay? Almost like the highest in the nation.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Alright, this is what it looks like on a good day.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
If you've been there, you know what I'm talking about.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
So, what's wrong with this picture?

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Well, the picture is, there is a huge gap here.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
The one thing that never happens in my doctor's office:

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
They never ask me about my place history.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
No doctor, can I remember, ever asking me,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
"Where have you lived?"

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
They haven't asked me what kind of the quality

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
of the drinking water that I put in my mouth

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
or the food that I ingest into my stomach.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
They really don't do that. It's missing.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Look at the kind of data that's available.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
This data's from all over the world --

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
countries spend billions of dollars investing in this kind of research.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Now, I've circled the places where I've been.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Well, by design, if I wanted to have a heart attack

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
I'd been in the right places. Right?

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
So, how many people are in the white?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
How many people in the room have spent the majority of their life

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
in the white space?

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Anybody? Boy you're lucky.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
How many have spent it in the red places?

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Oh, not so lucky.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
There are thousands of these kinds of maps

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
that are displayed in atlases

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
all over the world.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
They give us some sense of what's going

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
to be our train wreck.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
But none of that's in my medical record.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
And it's not in yours either.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
So, here's my friend Paul.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
He's a colleague. He allowed his cell phone to be tracked

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
every two hours, 24/7,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
365 days out of the year

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
for the last two years, everywhere he went.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And you can see he's been to a few places around the United States.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And this is where he has spent most of his time.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
If you really studied that you might have some clues

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
as to what Paul likes to do.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Anybody got any clues? Ski. Right.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
We can zoom in here, and we suddenly see

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
that now we see where Paul has really spent a majority of his time.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
And all of those black dots are all of the

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
toxic release inventories

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
that are monitored by the EPA.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Did you know that data existed?

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
For every community in the United States,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
you could have your own personalized map of that.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
So, our cell phones can now build a place history.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
This is how Paul did it. He did it with his iPhone.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
This might be what we end up with.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
This is what the physician would have

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
in front of him and her when we enter that exam room

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
instead of just the pink slip that said I paid at the counter. Right?

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
This could be my little assessment.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
And he looks at that and he says,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
"Whoa Bill,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
I suggest that maybe you not decide,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
just because you're out here in beautiful California,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
and it's warm every day,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
that you get out and run at six o'clock at night.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
I'd suggest that that's a bad idea Bill,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
because of this report."

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
What I'd like to leave you for are two prescriptions.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Okay, number one is, we must teach physicians

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
about the value of geographical information.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
It's called geomedicine. There are about a half a dozen programs in the world right now

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
that are focused on this.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
And they're in the early stages of development.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
These programs need to be supported,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
and we need to teach our future

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
doctors of the world

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
the importance of some of the information

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
I've shared here with you today.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
The second thing we need to do

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
is while we're spending billions and billions

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
of dollars all over the world

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
building an electronic health record,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
we make sure we put a place history

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
inside that medical record.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
It not only will be important for the physician;

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
it will be important for the researchers

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
that now will have huge samples to draw upon.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
But it will also be useful for us.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
I could have made the decision, if I had this information,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
not to move to the ozone capital

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
of the United States, couldn't I? I could make that decision.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Or I could negotiate with my employer

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
to make that decision

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000
in the best interest of myself and my company.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
With that, I would like to just say that Jack Lord said

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
this almost 10 years ago.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Just look at that for a minute.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
That was what the conclusion

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
of the Dartmouth Atlas of Healthcare was about,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
was saying that we can explain the geographic variations

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
that occur in disease, in illness, in wellness,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
and how our healthcare system actually operates.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
That was what he was talking about

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
on that quote.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
And I would say he got it right almost a decade ago.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
So, I'd very much like to see us begin to

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
really seize this as an opportunity to get this into our medical records.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
So with that, I'll leave you that

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
in my particular view of view of health:

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Geography always matters.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
And I believe that geographic information

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
can make both you and me very healthy. Thank you.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
(Applause)
