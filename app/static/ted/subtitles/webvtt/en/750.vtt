00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I'm going to speak to you today about architectural agency.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
What I mean by that is that it's time for architecture

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
to do things again, not just represent things.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This is a construction helmet that I received two years ago

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
at the groundbreaking of the largest project

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I, and my firm, have ever been involved in.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I was thrilled to get it. I was thrilled to be the only person

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
standing on the stage with a shiny silver helmet.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I thought it represented the importance of the architect.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I stayed thrilled until I got home,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
threw the helmet onto my bed,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
fell down onto my bed and realized inside

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
there was an inscription.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
(Laughter)

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Now, I think that this is a great metaphor

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
for the state of architecture and architects today.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We are for decorative purposes only.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
(Laughter)

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Now, who do we have to blame?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
We can only blame ourselves. Over the last 50 years

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
the design and construction industry has gotten much more complex

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and has gotten much more litigious.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And we architects are cowards.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
So, as we have faced liability,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
we have stepped back and back,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and unfortunately, where there is liability, guess what there is:

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
power.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So, eventually we have found ourselves

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
in a totally marginalized position, way over here.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Now, what did we do? We're cowards,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
but we're smart cowards.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And so we redefined this marginalized position as the place of architecture.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And we announced, "Hey, architecture, it's over here,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
in this autonomous language

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
we're going to seed control of processes."

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And we were going to do something that was horrible for the profession.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
We actually created an artificial schism

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
between creation and execution,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
as if you could actually create without knowing how to execute

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and as if you could actually execute

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
without knowing how to create.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Now, something else happened.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And that's when we began to sell the world

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
that architecture was created by individuals

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
creating genius sketches.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And that the incredible amount of effort to deliver those sketches

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
for years and years and years is not only something

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
to be derided,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
but we would merely write it off as

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
merely execution.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Now I'd argue that that is as absurd as stating

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
that 30 minutes of copulation is the creative act,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and nine months of gestation,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and, God forbid, 24 hours of child labor

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
is merely execution.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
So, what do we architects need to do? We need to stitch back

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
creation and execution.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And we need to start authoring processes again

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
instead of authoring objects.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Now, if we do this, I believe we can go back 50 years

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and start reinjecting agency,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
social engineering, back into architecture.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Now, there are all kinds of things that we architects need to learn how to do,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
like managing contracts, learning how to write contracts,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
understanding procurement processes,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
understanding the time value of money and cost estimation.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
But I'm going to reduce this to the beginning of the process,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
into three very pedantic statements.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
The first is: Take core positions with your client.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
I know it's shocking, right, that architecture would actually say that.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
The second position is: Actually take positions.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Take joint positions with your client.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
This is the moment in which you as the architect

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
and your client can begin to inject

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
vision and agency.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
But it has to be done together.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
And then only after this is done

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
are you allowed to do this, begin to put forward

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
architectural manifestations

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
that manifest those positions.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And both owner and architect alike

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
are empowered to critique those manifestations

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
based on the positions that you've taken.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Now, I believe that one really amazing thing will happen if you do this.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
I'd like to call it the lost art of productively losing control.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
You do not know what the end result is.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
But I promise you, with enough brain power

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
and enough passion and enough commitment,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
you will arrive at conclusions

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
that will transcend convention,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
and will simply be something

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
that you could not have initially

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
or individually conceived of.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Alright, now I'm going to reduce all of this to a series

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
of simple dumb sketches.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
This is the modus operandi that we have today.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
We roll 120-foot Spartan,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
i.e. our vision, up to our clients' gates of Troy.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And we don't understand why they won't let us in. Right?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Well, how about instead of doing that,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
we roll up to the gates something they want.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Now this is a little bit of a dangerous metaphor,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
because of course we all know that inside

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
of the Trojan Horse were a bunch of people with spears.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
So, we can change the metaphor. Let's call the Trojan Horse

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
the vessel by which

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
you get through the gate,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
get through the constraints of a project.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
At which point, you and your client

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
have the ability to start considering what

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
you're going to put inside that vessel,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
the agency, the vision.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And if you do that, you do that responsibly,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
I believe that instead of delivering Spartans,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
you can deliver maidens.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And if I could summarize that all up into one single sketch it would be this.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
If we are so good at our craft

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
shouldn't we be able to conceive

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
of an architectural manifestation

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
that slides seamlessly through

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
the project's and the client's constraints?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Now, with that in mind, I'm going to show a project

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
that's very dear to many people in this room--

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
well, maybe not dear, but certainly close to many people in this room.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And that's a project that is just about to open next week,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
the new home for the Dallas Theater Center,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
the Dee and Charles Wyly Theatre.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Now, I'm going to present it on the same terms:

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
issue, position and architectural manifestation.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Now, the first issue that we faced

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
was that the Dallas Theater Center

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
had a notoriety that was beyond what you would expect

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
of some place outside of the triumvirate

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
of New York, Chicago and Seattle.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
And this had to do with the ambitions of the leadership.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
But it also had to do with something rather unusual,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
and that was this horrible little building that they'd been performing in.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Why was this horrible little building

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
so important to their renown and their innovation?

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Because they could do whatever they wanted to to this building.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
When you're on Broadway, you cannot tear the proscenium down.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
This building, when an artistic director

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
wanted to do a "Cherry Orchard" and wanted people

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
and wanted people to come out of a well on the stage,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
they brought a backhoe in, and they simply dug the hole.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Well, that's exciting.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And you can start to get the best artistic directors,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
scenic designers and actors from around the country

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
to come to perform here

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
because you can do things you can't do elsewhere.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
So, the first position we took was,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
"Hey, we as architects had better not show up

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
and do a pristine building

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
that doesn't engender the same freedoms that this

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
old dilapidated shed provided the company."

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
The second issue is a nuance of the first.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
And that's that the company and the building was multiform.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
That meant that they were able to perform,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
as long as they had labor

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
they were able to go between proscenium, thrust, flat floor,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
arena, traverse, you name it.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
All they needed was labor.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Well, something happened. In fact something happened to all institutions

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
around the world.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
It started to become hard to raise operational costs,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
operational budgets.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
So, they stopped having inexpensive labor.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
And eventually they had to freeze their organization

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
into something called a bastardized thruscenium.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
So, the second position we took is that the freedoms that we provided,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
the ability to move between stage configurations,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
had better be able to be done

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
without relying on operational costs. Alright? Affordably.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
The architectural manifestation

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
was frankly just dumb.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
It was to take all the things that are known as front of house and back of house

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
and redefine them as above house and below house.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
At first blush you think, "Hey it's crazy,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
what could you possibly gain?"

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
We created what we like to call superfly.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000
(Laughter)

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Now, superfly, the concept is

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
you take all the freedoms you normally associate with the flytower,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
and you smear them across flytower and auditorium.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Suddenly the artistic director

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
can move between different stage

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
and audience configurations.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And because that flytower has the ability to pick up

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
all the pristine elements, suddenly the rest of the environment

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
can be provisional. And you can drill, cut, nail, screw

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
paint and replace,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
with a minimum of cost.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
But there was a third advantage that we got by doing this move

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
that was unexpected.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And that was that it freed up the perimeter of the auditorium

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
in a most unusual way.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
And that provided the artistic director suddenly

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
the ability to define suspension of disbelief.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
So, the building affords artistic directors the freedom

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
to conceive of almost any kind of activity

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
underneath this floating object.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
But also to challenge the notion of suspension of disbelief

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
such that in the last act of Macbeth,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
if he or she wants you to associate

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
the parable that you're seeing with Dallas, with your real life,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
he or she can do so.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Now, in order to do this we and the clients

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
had to do something fairly remarkable.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
In fact it really was the clients who had to do it.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
They had to make a decision, based on the positions we took

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
to redefine the budget being from two thirds capital-A architecture

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
and one-third infrastructure,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
to actually the inverse,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
two-thirds infrastructure and one-third capital-A architecture.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
That's a lot for a client to commit to

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
before you actually see the fruition of the concept.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
But based on the positions,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
they took the educated leap of faith to do so.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
And effectively we created what we like to call

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
a theater machine.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Now, that theater machine has ability

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
to move between a whole series of configurations

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
at the push of a button and a few stagehands

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
in a short amount of time.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
But it also has the potential

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
to not only provide multiform but multi-processional sequences.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Meaning: The artistic director

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
doesn't necessarily need to go through our lobby.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
One of the things that we learned when we visited various theaters

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
is they hate us architects,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
because they say the first thing they have to do,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
the first five minutes of any show,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
is they have to get our architecture

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
out of the mind of their patron.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Well now there are potentials of this building

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
to allow the artistic director

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
to actually move into the building

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
without using our architecture.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
So, in fact, there is the building, there is what we call the draw.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
You're going down into our lobby,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
go through the lobby with our own little dangly bits, whether you like them or not,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
up through the stair that leads you into the auditorium.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
But there is also the potential

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
to allow people to move directly from the outside,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
in this case suggesting kind of Wagnerian entrance,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
into the interior of the auditorium.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
And here is the fruition of that in actuality.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
These are the two large pivoting doors

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
that allow people to move directly from the outside, in

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
or from the inside, out,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
performers or audience alike.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Now, imagine what that could be. I have to say honestly

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
this is not something yet the building can do because it takes too long.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
But imagine the freedoms

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
if you could take this further, that in fact you could consider

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
a Wagnerian entry,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
a first act in thrust,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
an intermission in Greek, a second act in arena,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
and you leave through our lobby with dangly bits.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Now that, I would say, is architecture performing.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
It is taking the hand of the architect

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
to actually remove the hand of the architect

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
in favor of the hand of the artistic director.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
I'll go through the three basic configurations.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
This is the flat floor configuration.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
You notice that there is no proscenium,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
the balconies have been raised up, there are no seats,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
the floor in the auditorium is flat.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
The first configuration is easy to understand.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
The balconies come down, you see that the orchestra

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
begins to have a rake that's frontal towards the end stage,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
and the seats come in.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
The third configuration is a little harder to understand.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Here you see that the balconies actually have to move out of the way

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
in order to bring a thrust into the space.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
And some of the seats need to actually change their direction,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
and change their rake, to allow that to happen.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
I'll do it again so you can see it.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
There you see it's the side balconies for the proscenium.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
And there it is in the thrust configuration.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
In order to do that,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
again, we needed a client who was willing to take educational risks.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
And they told us one important thing:

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
"You shall not beta-test."

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Meaning, nothing that we do

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
can we be the first ones to do it.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
But they were willing for us to apply technologies

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
from other areas that already had failsafe mechanisms to this building.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
And the solution in terms of the balconies

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
was to use something that we all know as a scoreboard lift.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Now, if you were to take a scoreboard

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
and drop it on dirt and whiskey,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
that would be bad.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
If you were not able to take the scoreboard out of the arena

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
and be able to do the Ice Capades the next night,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
that would also be bad.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
And so this technology already had all the failsafe mechanisms

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
and allowed the theater and our client

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
to actually do this with confidence

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
that they would be able to change over their configurations at will.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
The second technology that we applied

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
was actually using things that you know from

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
the stage side of an opera house.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
In this case what we're doing is we're taking

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
the orchestra floor, lifting it up, spinning it,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
changing the rake, taking it back to flat floor,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
changing the rake again. In essence, you can begin to define

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
rakes and viewing angles

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
of people in the orchestra seating, at will.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Here you see the chairs being spun around to go from proscenium or end stage

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
to thrust configuration.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
The proscenium, also. As far as we know this is the first building in the world

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
in which the proscenium can entirely fly out of the space.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Here you see the various acoustic baffles as well as

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
the flying mechanisms and catwalks over the auditorium.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
And ultimately, up in the flytower,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000
the scene sets that allow the transformations to occur.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
As I said, all that was in service of creating a flexible

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
yet affordable configuration.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
But we got this other benefit, and that was

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
the ability of the perimeter to suddenly engage

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Dallas on the outside.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Here you see the building in its current state

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
with blinds closed. This is a trompe l'oeil.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Actually this is not a curtain. These are vinyl blinds

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
that are integrated into the windows themselves,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
again with failsafe mechanisms

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
that can be lifted such that you can completely demystify,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
if you chose, the operations of the theater

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
going on behind, rehearsals and so forth.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
But you also have the ability

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
to allow the audience to see Dallas,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
to perform with Dallas as the backdrop of your performance.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Now, if I'll take you through --

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
this is an early concept sketch --

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
take you through kind of a mixture of all these things together.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Effectively you would have something like this.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
You would be allowed to bring objects or performers into the performing chamber:

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
"Aida," their elephants, you can bring the elephants in.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000
You would be able to expose the auditorium to Dallas

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
or vice versa, Dallas to the auditorium.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
You'd be able to open portions in order to

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
change the procession,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
allow people to come in and out for an intermission,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
or to enter for the beginning or the end of a performance.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
As I said, all the balconies can move,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
but they can also be disappeared completely.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
The proscenium can fly.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
You can bring large objects into the chamber itself.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
But most convincingly when we had to confront the idea

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
of changing costs from architecture to infrastructure,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
is something that is represented by this.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
And again, this is not all the flexibilities of the building that is actually built,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
but at least suggests the ideas.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
This building has the ability, in short order,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
to go back to a flat floor organization

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
such that they can rent it out.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Now, if there is anyone here from American Airlines,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
please consider doing your Christmas party here.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000
(Laughter)

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
That allows the company to raise operational budgets

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
without having to compete with other venues

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
with much larger auditoriums.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
That's an enormous benefit.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
So, the theater company has the ability

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
to do totally hermetic,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
light-controlled, sound-controlled, great acoustics,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
great intimacy Shakespeare,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
but can also do Beckett

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
with the skyline of Dallas sitting behind it.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Here it is in a flat floor configuration.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
The theater has been going through its kind of paces.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Here it is in an end stage configuration.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
It's actually beautiful. There was a rock band.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
We stood outside trying to see if the acoustics worked,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
and you could see the guys doing this but you couldn't hear them.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
It was very unusual.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Here it is in a thrust configuration.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
And last but not least,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
you see this already has the ability to create events

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
in order to generate operational budgets

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
to overcome the building in fact performing

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
to allow the company to overcome their biggest problem.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
I'm going to show you a brief time lapse.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
As I said, this can be done with only two people,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
and with a minimum amount of time.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
This is the first time that actually the changeover was done

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
and so there is literally thousands of people because

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
everyone was excited and wanted to be a part of it.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
So, in a way try to disregard all the thousands of ants running around.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
And think of it being done with just a few people.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
Again, just a couple people are required.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000
(Laughter)

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
I promise.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Et voila.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:33.000
(Applause)

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
So, just in conclusion, a few shots.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
This is the AT&amp;T Performing Arts Center's

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Dee and Charles Wyly Theater.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
There it is at night.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
And last but not least the entire AT&amp;T Performing Arts Center.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
You can see the Winspear Opera House on the right

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
and the Dee and Charles Wyly Theater on the left.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
And to remind you that here is an example in which

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
architecture actually did something.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
But we got to that conclusion

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
without understanding where we were going,

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
what we knew were a series of issues that the company

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
and the client was confronted with.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
And we took positions with them, and it was through those positions

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
that we began to take architectural manifestations

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
and we arrived at a conclusion that none of us,

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
really none of us could ever

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
have conceived of initially or individually.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Thank you.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
(Applause)
