WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Namaste. Good morning.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm very happy to be here in India.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And I've been thinking a lot about what I have learned

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
over these last particularly 11 years

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
with V-Day and "The Vagina Monologues,"

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
traveling the world,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
essentially meeting with women and girls across the planet

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
to stop violence against women.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
What I want to talk about today

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
is this particular cell,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
or grouping of cells, that is in each and every one of us.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And I want to call it the girl cell.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And it's in men as well as in women.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I want you to imagine that this particular grouping of cells

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
is central to the evolution of our species

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and the continuation of the human race.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And I want you imagine that at some point in history

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
a group of powerful people invested in owning and controlling the world

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
understood that the suppression of this particular cell,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
the oppression of these cells,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
the reinterpretation of these cells,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
the undermining of these cells,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
getting us to believe in the weakness of these cells

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and the crushing, eradicating, destroying,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
reducing these cells,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
basically began the process of killing off the girl cell,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
which was, by the way, patriarchy.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I want you to imagine that the girl is a chip

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
in the huge macrocosm of collective consciousness.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And it is essential to balance, to wisdom

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and to actually the future of all of us.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And then I want you to imagine that this girl cell

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
is compassion,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and it's empathy, and it's passion itself,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and it's vulnerability,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and it's openness, and it's intensity,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and it's association, and it's relationship,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and it is intuitive.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And then let's think how compassion informs wisdom,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and that vulnerability is our greatest strength,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and that emotions have inherent logic,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
which lead to radical, appropriate, saving action.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And then let's remember that we've been taught

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
the exact opposite by the powers that be,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
that compassion clouds your thinking,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
that it gets in the way,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
that vulnerability is weakness,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
that emotions are not to be trusted,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and you're not supposed to take things personally,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
which is one of my favorites.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I think the whole world has essentially

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
been brought up not to be a girl.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
How do we bring up boys? What does it mean to be a boy?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
To be a boy really means not to be a girl.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
To be a man means not to be a girl.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
To be a woman means not to be a girl.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
To be strong means not to be a girl.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
To be a leader means not to be a girl.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I actually think that

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
being a girl is so powerful

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
that we've had to train everyone not to be that.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:47.000
(Laughter)

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And I'd also like to say that the irony

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
of course, is that denying girl,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
suppressing girl, suppressing emotion,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
refusing feeling has lead thus here.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Where we have now come to live in a world where

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
the most extreme forms of violence,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
the most horrific poverty,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
genocide, mass rapes,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
the destruction of the Earth, is completely out of control.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And because we have suppressed our girl cells

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
and suppressed our girl-ship,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
we do not feel what is going on.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
So, we are not being charged with

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
the adequate response to what is happening.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
I want to talk a little bit about

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
the Democratic Republic of Congo.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
For me, it was the turning point of my life.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
I have spent a lot of time there in the last three years.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
I feel up to that point I had seen a lot in the world,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
a lot of violence.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
I essentially lived in the rape mines of the world for the last 12 years.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
But the Democratic Republic of Congo

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
really was the turning point in my soul.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
I went and I spent time

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
in a place called Bukavu

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
in a hospital called the Panzi Hospital,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
with a doctor who was as close to a saint as any person I've ever met.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
His name is Dr. Denis Mukwege.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
In the Congo, for those of you who don't know,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
there has been a war raging for the last 12 years,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
a war that has killed nearly six million people.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
It is estimated that somewhere between 300,000 and 500,000 women

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
have been raped there.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
When I spent my first weeks at Panzi hospital

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
I sat with women

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
who sat and lined up every day to tell me their stories.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Their stories were so horrific,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
and so mind-blowing and so on the other side of human existence,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
that to be perfectly honest with you, I was shattered.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
And I will tell you that what happened

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
is through that shattering,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
listening to the stories of eight-year-old girls who had their insides eviscerated,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
who had guns and bayonets and things shoved inside them

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
so they had holes, literally, inside them

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
where their pee and poop came out of them.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Listening to the story of 80-year-old women

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
who were tied to chains and circled,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
and where groups of men would come and rape them periodically,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
all in the name of economic exploitation

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
to steal the minerals so the West can have it and profit from them.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
My mind was so shattered.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
But what happened for me is that that shattering

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
actually emboldened me

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
in a way I have never been emboldened.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
That shattering, that opening of my girl cell,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000
that kind of massive breakthrough of my heart

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
allowed me to become more courageous, and braver,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
and actually more clever

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
than I had been in the past in my life.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
I want to say that I think the powers that be

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
know that empire-building

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
is actually -- that feelings get in the way of empire-building.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Feelings get in the way of the mass acquisition of the Earth,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and excavating the Earth, and destroying things.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
I remember, for example, when my father,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
who was very, very violent, used to beat me.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
And he would actually say, while he was beating me,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
"Don't you cry. Don't you dare cry."

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Because my crying somehow exposed his brutality to him.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
And even in the moment he didn't want to be reminded

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
of what he was doing.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
I know that we have systematically annihilated the girl cell.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
And I want to say we've annihilated it in men as well as in women.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
And I think in some ways

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
we've been much harsher to men

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
in the annihilation of their girl cell.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000
(Applause)

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
I see how boys have been brought up, and I see this across the planet:

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
to be tough, to be hardened,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
to distance themselves from their tenderness, to not cry.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
I actually realized once in Kosovo,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
when I watched a man break down,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
that bullets are actually hardened tears,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
that when we don't allow men to have their girl self

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
and have their vulnerability, and have their compassion,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
and have their hearts, that they become hardened and hurtful

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and violent.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
And I think we have taught men to be secure

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
when they are insecure,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
to pretend they know things when they don't know things,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
or why would we be where we are?

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
To pretend they're not a mess when they are a mess.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
And I will tell you a very funny story.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
On my way here on the airplane, I was walking up and down the aisle of the plane.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
And all these men, literally at least 10 men,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
were in their little seats watching chick flicks.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
And they were all alone, and I thought, "This is the secret life of men."

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
(Laughter)

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
I've traveled, as I said,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
to many, many countries,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
and I've seen, if we do what we do to the girl inside us

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
then obviously it's horrific to think

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
what we do to girls in the world.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
And we heard from Sunitha yesterday,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
and Kavita about what we do to girls.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
But I just want to say that

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
I've met girls with knife wounds and cigarette burns,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
who are literally being treated like ashtrays.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
I've seen girls be treated like garbage cans.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
I've seen girls who were beaten by their mothers

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
and brothers and fathers and uncles.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
I've seen girls starving themselves to death in America

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
in institutions to look like some idealized version of themselves.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
I've seen that we cut girls and we control them

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
and we keep them illiterate,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
or we make them feel bad about being too smart.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
We silence them. We make them feel guilty

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
for being smart. We get them to behave,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
to tone it down, not to be too intense.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
We sell them, we kill them as embryos,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
we enslave them, we rape them.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
We are so accustomed to robbing girls

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
of the subject of being the subjects of their lives

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
that we have now actually objectified them

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
and turned them into commodities.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
The selling of girls is rampant across the planet.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000
And in many places they are worth less than goats and cows.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
But I also want to talk about the fact that

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
if one in eight people on the planet

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
are girls between the ages of 10 to 24,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
they are they key, really, in the developing world,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
as well as in the whole world, to the future of humanity.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And if girls are in trouble because they face systematic disadvantages

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
that keep them where society wants them to be,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
including lack of access to healthcare,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
education, healthy foods,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
labor force participation.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
The burden of all the household tasks

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
usually falls on girls and younger siblings,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
which ensures that they will never overcome these barriers.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
The state of girls, the condition of girls,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
will, in my belief -- and that's the girl inside us

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
and the girl in the world -- determine whether

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
the species survives.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
And what I want to suggest is that,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
having talked to girls, because I just finished a new book called

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
"I Am an Emotional Creature: The Secret Life of Girls Around the World,"

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
I've been talking to girls for five years,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
and one of the things that I've seen is true everywhere

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
is that the verb that's been enforced on girl

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
is the verb "to please."

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Girls are trained to please.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
I want to change the verb.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
I want us all to change the verb.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
I want the verb to be "educate,"

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
or "activate," or "engage,"

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
or "confront," or "defy," or "create."

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
If we teach girls to change the verb

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
we will actually enforce the girl inside us

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
and the girl inside them.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
And I have to now share a few stories

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
of girls I've seen across the planet

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
who have engaged their girl,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
who have taken on their girl in spite of

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
all the circumstances around them.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
I know a 14-year-old girl in the Netherlands,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
for example, who is demanding that she take a boat

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
and go around the entire world by herself.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
There is a teenage girl who just recently

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
went out and knew that she needed 56 stars

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
tattooed on the right side of her face.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
There is a girl, Julia Butterfly Hill,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
who lived for a year in a tree

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
because she wanted to protect the wild oaks.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
There is a girl who I met 14 years ago in Afghanistan

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
who I have adopted as my daughter

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
because her mother was killed. Her mother was a revolutionary.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
And this girl, when she was 17 years old,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
wore a burqa in Afghanistan,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
and went into the stadiums

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
and documented the atrocities that were going on towards women,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
underneath her burqa, with a video.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
And that video became the video that went out all over the world

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000
after 9/11 to show what was going on in Afghanistan.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
I want to talk about Rachel Corrie

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
who was in her teens when she stood in front of an Israeli tank

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
to say, "End the occupation."

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
And she knew she risked death and she was literally gunned down

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
and rolled over by that tank.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
And I want to talk about a girl that I just met recently

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
in Bukavu, who was impregnated by her rapist.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
And she was holding her baby.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
And I asked her if she loved her baby.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
And she looked into her baby's eyes and she said,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
"Of course I love my baby. How could I not love my baby?

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
It's my baby and it's full of love."

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
The capacity for girls to overcome situations

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
and to move on levels, to me, is mind-blowing.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
There is a girl named Dorcas, and I just met her in Kenya.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Dorcas is 15 years old,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
and she was trained in self-defense.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
A few months ago she was picked up on the street

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
by three older men.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
They kidnapped her, they put her in a car.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
And through her self-defense, she grabbed their Adam's apples,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
she punched them in the eyes

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
and she got herself free and out of the car.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
In Kenya, in August,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
I went to visit one of the V-Day safe houses for girls,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
a house we opened seven years ago

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
with an amazing woman named Agnes Pareyio.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Agnes was a woman who was cut when she was a little girl,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
she was female genitally mutilated.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
And she made a decision as many women do across this planet,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
that what was done to her would not be enforced and done

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
to other women and girls.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
So, for years Agnes walked through the Rift valley.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
She taught girls what a healthy vagina looked like,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
and what a mutilated vagina looked like.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
And in that time she saved many girls. And when we met her

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
we asked her what we could do for her,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
and she said, "Well, if you got me a Jeep I could get around a lot faster."

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
So, we got her a Jeep. And then she saved 4,500 girls.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
And then we asked her, "Okay, what else do you need?"

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
And she said, "Well, now, I need a house."

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
So, seven years ago Agnes built the first V-Day safe house

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
in Narok, Kenya, in the Masai land.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
And it was a house where girls could run away,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
they could save their clitoris, they wouldn't be cut,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
they could go to school.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
And in the years that Agnes has had the house,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
she has changed the situation there.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
She has literally become deputy mayor.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
She's changed the rules.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
The whole community has bought in to what she's doing.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
When we were there she was doing a ritual

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
where she reconciles girls, who have run away, with their families.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
And there was a young girl named Jaclyn.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Jaclyn was 14 years old and she was in her Masai family

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
and there's a drought in Kenya.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
So cows are dying, and cows are the most

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
valued possession.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
And Jaclyn overheard her father

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
talking to an old man about

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
how he was about to sell her for the cows.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
And she knew that meant she would be cut.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
She knew that meant she wouldn't go to school.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
She knew that meant she wouldn't have a future.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
She knew she would have to marry that old man, and she was 14.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
So, one afternoon, she'd heard about the safe house,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Jaclyn left her father's house

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
and she walked for two days, two days

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
through Masai land.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
She slept with the hyenas. She hid at night.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
She imagined her father killing her on one hand,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
and Mama Agnes greeting her,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
with the hope that she would greet her when she got to the house.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
And when she got to the house she was greeted.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Agnes took her in, and Agnes loved her,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
and Agnes supported her for the year.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
She went to school and she found her voice,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
and she found her identity, and she found her heart.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Then, her time was ready

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
when she had to go back to talk to her father

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
about the reconciliation, after a year.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
I had the privilege of being in the hut

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
when she was reunited with her father and reconciled.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
In that hut, we walked in,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
and her father and his four wives were sitting there,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
and her sisters who had just returned because

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
they had all fled when she had fled,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
and her primary mother, who had been beaten

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
in standing up for her with the elders.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
When her father saw her and saw who she had become,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
in her full girl self,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
he threw his arms around her and broke down crying.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
He said, "You are beautiful. You have grown into a gorgeous woman.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
We will not cut you.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
And I give you my word, here and now,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
that we will not cut your sisters either."

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
And what she said to him was,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
"You were willing to sell me for four cows,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
and a calf and some blankets.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
But I promise you, now that I will be educated

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
I will always take care of you,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
and I will come back and I will build you a house.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
And I will be in your corner for the rest of your life."

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
For me, that is the power of girls.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
And that is the power of transformation.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
I want to close today

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
with a new piece from my book.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
And I want to do it tonight

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
for the girl in everybody here.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
And I want to do it for Sunitha.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
And I want to do it for the girls that Sunitha talked about yesterday,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000
the girls who survive, the girls who can become somebody else.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000
But I really want to do it for each and every person here,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
to value the girl in us,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
to value the part that cries,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
to value the part that's emotional,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
to value the part that's vulnerable,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000
to understand that's where the future lies.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
This is called "I'm An Emotional Creature."

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
And it happened because I met a girl in Watts, L.A.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
I was asking girls if they like being a girl,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
and all the girls were like, "No, I hate it. I can't stand it.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
It's all bad. My brothers get everything."

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
And this girl just sat up and went, "I love being a girl.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
I'm an emotional creature!"

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000
(Laughter)

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
This is for her:

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
I love being a girl.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
I can feel what you're feeling

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
as you're feeling inside the feeling before.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
I am an emotional creature.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Things do not come to me as intellectual theories

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
or hard-pressed ideas.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
They pulse through my organs and legs and burn up my ears.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Oh, I know when your girlfriend's really pissed off,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
even though she appears to give you what you want.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
I know when a storm is coming.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
I can feel the invisible stirrings in the air.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
I can tell you he won't call back. It's a vibe I share.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
I am an emotional creature.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
I love that I do not take things lightly.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Everything is intense to me,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
the way I walk in the street, the way my momma wakes me up,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
the way it's unbearable when I lose, the way I hear bad news.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
I am an emotional creature.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
I am connected to everything and everyone. I was born like that.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Don't you say all negative

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
that it's only only a teenage thing,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
or it's only because I'm a girl.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
These feelings make me better.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
They make me present. They make me ready. They make me strong.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
I am an emotional creature.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
There is a particular way of knowing.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
It's like the older women somehow forgot.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
I rejoice that it's still in my body.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Oh, I know when the coconut's about to fall.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
I know we have pushed the Earth too far.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
I know my father isn't coming back,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
and that no one's prepared for the fire.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
I know that lipstick means more than show,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
and boys are super insecure,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
and so-called terrorists are made, not born.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
I know that one kiss

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
could take away all my decision-making ability.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
(Laughter)

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
And you know what? Sometimes it should.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
This is not extreme. It's a girl thing,

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
what we would all be if the big door inside us flew open.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Don't tell me not to cry, to calm it down,

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
not to be so extreme, to be reasonable.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
I am an emotional creature.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
It's how the earth got made, how the wind continues to pollinate.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000
You don't tell the Atlantic Ocean to behave.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
I am an emotional creature.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
Why would you want to shut me down or turn me off?

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
I am your remaining memory.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
I can take you back.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Nothing's been diluted.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Nothing's leaked out.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
I love, hear me, I love

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000
that I can feel the feelings inside you,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
even if they stop my life,

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
even if they break my heart,

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
even if they take me off track,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
they make me responsible.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000
I am an emotional, I am an emotional,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
incondotional, devotional creature.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
And I love, hear me,

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000
I love, love, love being a girl.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
Can you say it with me?

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
I love, I love, love, love

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
being a girl!

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
Thank you very much.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:33.000
(Applause)
