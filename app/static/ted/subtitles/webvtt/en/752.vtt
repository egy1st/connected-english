00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Please close your eyes,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and open your hands.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Now imagine what you could place in your hands:

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
an apple, maybe your wallet.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Now open your eyes.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
What about a life?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
What you see here is a premature baby.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
He looks like he's resting peacefully, but in fact he's struggling to stay alive

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
because he can't regulate his own body temperature.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
This baby is so tiny he doesn't have

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
enough fat on his body to stay warm.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Sadly, 20 million babies like this

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
are born every year around the world.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Four million of these babies die annually.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
But the bigger problem is that the ones who do survive

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
grow up with severe, long-term health problems.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The reason is because in the first month of a baby's life,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
its only job is to grow.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
If it's battling hypothermia, its organs can't develop normally,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
resulting in a range of health problems

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
from diabetes, to heart disease,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
to low I.Q.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Imagine: Many of these problems could be prevented

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
if these babies were just kept warm.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
That is the primary function of an incubator.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
But traditional incubators require electricity

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and cost up to 20 thousand dollars.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So, you're not going to find them in rural areas of developing countries.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
As a result, parents resort to local solutions

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
like tying hot water bottles around their babies' bodies,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
or placing them under light bulbs like the ones you see here --

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
methods that are both ineffective and unsafe.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I've seen this firsthand over and over again.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
On one of my first trips to India, I met this young woman, Sevitha,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
who had just given birth to a tiny premature baby, Rani.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
She took her baby to the nearest village clinic,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and the doctor advised her to take Rani

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
to a city hospital so she could be placed in an incubator.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
But that hospital was over four hours away,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and Sevitha didn't have the means to get there,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
so her baby died.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Inspired by this story, and dozens of other similar stories like this,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
my team and I realized what was needed was a local solution,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
something that could work without electricity,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
that was simple enough for a mother or a midwife to use,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
given that the majority of births still take place in the home.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
We needed something that was portable,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
something that could be sterilized and reused across multiple babies

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and something ultra-low-cost,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
compared to the 20,000 dollars

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
that an incubator in the U.S. costs.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
So, this is what we came up with.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
What you see here looks nothing like an incubator.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
It looks like a small sleeping bag for a baby.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
You can open it up completely. It's waterproof.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
There's no seams inside so you can sterilize it very easily.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
But the magic is in this pouch of wax.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
This is a phase-change material.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
It's a wax-like substance with a melting point

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
of human body temperature, 37 degrees Celsius.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
You can melt this simply using hot water

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and then when it melts it's able to maintain one constant temperature

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
for four to six hours at a time,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
after which you simply reheat the pouch.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
So, you then place it into this little pocket back here,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
and it creates a warm micro-environment

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
for the baby.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Looks simple, but we've reiterated this dozens of times

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
by going into the field to talk to doctors, moms and clinicians

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
to ensure that this really meets the needs of the local communities.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
We plan to launch this product in India in 2010,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
and the target price point will be 25 dollars,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
less than 0.1 percent of the cost

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
of a traditional incubator.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Over the next five years we hope to save the lives

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
of almost a million babies.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
But the longer-term social impact is a reduction in population growth.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
This seems counterintuitive,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
but turns out that as infant mortality is reduced,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
population sizes also decrease,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
because parents don't need to anticipate

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
that their babies are going to die.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
We hope that the Embrace infant warmer

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
and other simple innovations like this

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
represent a new trend for the future of technology:

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
simple, localized, affordable solutions

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
that have the potential to make huge social impact.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
In designing this we followed a few basic principles.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
We really tried to understand the end user,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
in this case, people like Sevitha.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
We tried to understand the root of the problem

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
rather than being biased by what already exists.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And then we thought of the most simple solution we could

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
to address this problem.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
In doing this, I believe we can truly bring technology to the masses.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
And we can save millions of lives through the simple warmth of an Embrace.
