00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So, imagine you're standing on a street anywhere in America

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and a Japanese man comes up to you and says,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
"Excuse me, what is the name of this block?"

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And you say, "I'm sorry, well, this is Oak Street, that's Elm Street.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
This is 26th, that's 27th."

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
He says, "OK, but what is the name of that block?"

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
You say, "Well, blocks don't have names.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Streets have names; blocks are just the

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
unnamed spaces in between streets."

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
He leaves, a little confused and disappointed.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So, now imagine you're standing on a street, anywhere in Japan,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
you turn to a person next to you and say,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
"Excuse me, what is the name of this street?"

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
They say, "Oh, well that's Block 17 and this is Block 16."

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And you say, "OK, but what is the name of this street?"

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And they say, "Well, streets don't have names.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Blocks have names.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Just look at Google Maps here. There's Block 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
All of these blocks have names,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and the streets are just the unnamed spaces in between the blocks.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And you say then, "OK, then how do you know your home address?"

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
He said, "Well, easy, this is District Eight.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
There's Block 17, house number one."

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
You say, "OK, but walking around the neighborhood,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I noticed that the house numbers don't go in order."

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
He says, "Of course they do. They go in the order in which they were built.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
The first house ever built on a block is house number one.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The second house ever built is house number two.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Third is house number three. It's easy. It's obvious."

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So, I love that sometimes we need to

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
go to the opposite side of the world

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
to realize assumptions we didn't even know we had,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and realize that the opposite of them may also be true.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
So, for example, there are doctors in China

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
who believe that it's their job to keep you healthy.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
So, any month you are healthy you pay them,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and when you're sick you don't have to pay them because they failed

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
at their job. They get rich when you're healthy, not sick.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
(Applause)

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
In most music, we think of the "one"

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
as the downbeat, the beginning of the musical phrase: one, two, three, four.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
But in West African music, the "one"

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
is thought of as the end of the phrase,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
like the period at the end of a sentence.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
So, you can hear it not just in the phrasing, but the way they count off their music:

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
two, three, four, one.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And this map is also accurate.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
(Laughter)

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
There's a saying that whatever true thing you can say about India,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
the opposite is also true.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
So, let's never forget, whether at TED, or anywhere else,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
that whatever brilliant ideas you have or hear,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
that the opposite may also be true.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Domo arigato gozaimashita.
