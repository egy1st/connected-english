00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
As a researcher, every once in a while

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
you encounter something

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
a little disconcerting.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And this is something that changes your understanding of the world around you,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and teaches you that you're very wrong

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
about something that you really believed firmly in.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And these are unfortunate moments,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
because you go to sleep that night

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
dumber than when you woke up.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So, that's really the goal of my talk,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
is to A, communicate that moment to you

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and B, have you leave this session

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
a little dumber than when you entered.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So, I hope I can really accomplish that.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So, this incident that I'm going to describe

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
really began with some diarrhea.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Now, we've known for a long time the cause of diarrhea.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
That's why there's a glass of water up there.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
For us, it's a problem, the people in this room.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
For babies, it's deadly.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
They lack nutrients, and diarrhea dehydrates them.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And so, as a result, there is a lot of death,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
a lot of death.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
In India in 1960,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
there was a 24 percent child mortality rate,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
lots of people didn't make it. This is incredibly unfortunate.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
One of the big reasons this happened was

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
because of diarrhea.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Now, there was a big effort to solve this problem,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and there was actually a big solution.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
This solution has been called, by some,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
"potentially the most important medical

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
advance this century."

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Now, the solution turned out to be simple.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And what it was was oral rehydration salts.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Many of you have probably used this.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
It's brilliant. It's a way to get sodium

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and glucose together so that when you add it to water

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
the child is able to absorb it even during situations of diarrhea.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Remarkable impact on mortality.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Massive solution to the problem.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Flash forward: 1960, 24 percent child mortality

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
has dropped to 6.5 percent today.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Still a big number, but a big drop.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
It looks like the technological problem is solved.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
But if you look, even today

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
there are about 400,000 diarrhea-related deaths

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
in India alone.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
What's going on here?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Well the easy answer is, we just haven't gotten those salts

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
to those people.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
That's actually not true.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
If you look in areas where these salts are completely available,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
the price is low or zero, these deaths still continue abated.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Maybe there's a biological answer.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Maybe these are the deaths that simple rehydration

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
alone doesn't solve. That's not true either.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Many of these deaths were completely preventable,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and this what I want to think of as the disconcerting thing,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
what I want to call "the last mile" problem.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
See, we spent a lot of energy, in many domains --

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
technological, scientific, hard work,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
creativity, human ingenuity --

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
to crack important social problems with technology solutions.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
That's been the discoveries of the last 2,000 years,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
that's mankind moving forward.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
But in this case we cracked it,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
but a big part of the problem still remains.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Nine hundred and ninety-nine miles went well,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
the last mile's proving incredibly stubborn.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Now, that's for oral rehydration therapy.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Maybe this is something unique about diarrhea.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Well, it turns out -- and this is where things get really disconcerting --

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
it's not unique to diarrhea.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
It's not even unique to poor people in India.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Here's an example from a variety of contexts.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
I've put a bunch of examples up here.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
I'll start with insulin, diabetes

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
medication in the U.S.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
OK, the American population.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
On Medicaid -- if you're fairly poor you get Medicaid,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
or if you have health insurance -- insulin is pretty straightforward.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
You get it, either in pill form or you get it as an injection;

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
you have to take it every day to maintain your blood sugar levels.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Massive technological advance:

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
took an incredibly deadly disease, made it solvable.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Adherence rates. How many people are taking their insulin every day?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
About on average, a typical person is taking it 75 percent of the time.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
As a result, 25,000 people a year go blind,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
hundreds of thousands lose limbs, every year,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
for something that's solvable.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Here I have a bunch of other examples,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
all suffer from the last mile problem.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
It's not just medicine.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Here's another example from technology:

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
agriculture. We think

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
there's a food problem, so we create new seeds.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
We think there's an income problem, so we create

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
new ways of farming that increase income.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Well, look at some old ways, some ways that we'd already cracked.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Intercropping. Intercropping really increases income.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Sometimes in rice we found incredible increases in yield

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
when you mix different varieties of rice side by side.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Some people are doing that,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
many are not. What's going on?

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
This is the last mile.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
The last mile is, everywhere, problematic.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Alright, what's the problem?

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
The problem is this little three-pound machine

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
that's behind your eyes and between your ears.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
This machine is really strange,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
and one of the consequences is that people are weird.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
They do lots of inconsistent things.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
(Applause)

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
They do lots of inconsistent things.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And the inconsistencies

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
create, fundamentally, this last mile problem.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
See, when we were dealing with our biology, bacteria,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
the genes, the things inside here, the blood?

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
That's complex, but it's manageable.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
When we're dealing with people like this?

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
The mind is more complex.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
That's not as manageable, and that's what we're struggling with.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Let me go back to diarrhea for a second.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Here's a question that was asked in the National Sample Survey,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
which is a survey asked of many Indian women:

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
"Your child has diarrhea.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Should you increase, maintain or decrease the number of fluids?"

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Just so you don't embarrass yourselves, I'll give you the right answer:

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
It's increase.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Now, diarrhea's interesting

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
because it's been around for thousands of years,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
ever since humankind really

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
lived side by side enough to have really polluted water.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
One Roman strategy that was very interesting

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
was that -- and it really gave them a comparative advantage --

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
they made sure their soldiers didn't drink

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
even remotely muddied waters.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Because if some of your troops get diarrhea they're not that effective

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
on the battlefield.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
So, if you think of Roman comparative advantage part of it was the breast shields,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
the breastplates, but part of it was drinking the right water.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
So, here are these women. They've seen their parents

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
have struggled with diarrhea, they've struggled with diarrhea,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
they've seen lots of deaths. How do they answer this question?

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
In India, 35 to 50 percent say "Reduce."

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Think about what that means for a second.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Thirty-five to 50 percent of women

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
forget oral rehydration therapy,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
they are increasing --

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
they are actually making their child

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
more likely to die through their actions.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
How is that possible?

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Well, one possibility -- I think that's how most people respond to this --

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
is to say, "That's just stupid."

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
I don't think that's stupid.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
I think there is something very profoundly right in what these women are doing.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And that is, you don't put water

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
into a leaky bucket.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
So, think of the mental model that goes behind reducing the intake.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Just doesn't make sense.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Now, the model is intuitively right.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
It just doesn't happen to be right about the world.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
But it makes a whole lot of sense at some deep level.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
And that, to me, is the fundamental challenge

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000
of the last mile.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
This first challenge is what I refer to as the persuasion challenge.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Convincing people to do something --

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
take oral rehydration therapy, intercrop, whatever it might be --

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
is not an act of information:

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
"Let's give them the data,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
and when they have data they'll do the right thing."

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
It's more complex than that.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
And if you want to understand how it's more complex

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
let me start with something kind of interesting.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
I'm going to give you a little math problem,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
and I want you to just yell out the answer as fast as possible.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
A bat and a ball together cost $1.10.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
The bat costs a dollar more than the ball.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
How much does the ball cost? Quick.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
So, somebody out there says, "Five."

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
A lot of you said, "Ten."

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Let's think about 10 for a second.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
If the ball costs 10, the bat costs...

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
this is easy, $1.10.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Yeah. So, together they would cost $1.20.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
So, here you all are, ostensibly educated people.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Most of you look smart.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
The combination of that produces

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
something that is actually, you got this thing wrong.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
How is that possible? Let's go to something else.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
I know algebra can be complicated.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
So, let's dial this back. That's what? Fifth grade? Fourth grade?

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Let's go back to kindergarten. OK?

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
There's a great show on American television that you have to watch.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
It's called "Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader?"

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
I think we've learned the answer to that here.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Let's move to kindergarten. Let's see if we can beat five-year-olds.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Here's what I'm going to do: I'm going to put objects on the screen.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
I just want you to name the color of the object.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
That's all it is. OK?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
I want you to do it fast, and say it out loud with me,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
and do it quickly. I'll make the first one easy for you.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Ready? Black.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Now the next ones I want you to do quickly and say it out loud.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Ready? Go.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Audience: Red. Green.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Yellow. Blue. Red.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
(Laughter)

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Sendhil Mullainathan: That's pretty good.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Almost out of kindergarten.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
What is all this telling us?

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
You see, what's going on here, and in the bat and ball problem

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
is that you have some intuitive ways of interacting with the world,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
some models that you use to understand the world.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
These models, like the leaky bucket,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
work well in most situations.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
I suspect most of you --

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
I hope that's true for the rest of you --

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
actually do pretty well with addition and subtraction in the real world.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
I found a problem, a specific problem

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
that actually found an error with that.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Diarrhea, and many last mile problems, are like that.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
They are situations where the mental model

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
doesn't match the reality.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Same thing here:

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
You had an intuitive response to this that was very quick.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
You read "blue" and you wanted to say "blue," even though you knew your task was red.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Now, I do this stuff because it's fun.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
But it's more profound than fun.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
I'll give you a good example of how it actually effects persuasion.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
BMW is a pretty safe car.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
And they are trying to figure out, "Safety is good.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
I want to advertise safety. How am I going to advertise safety?"

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
"I could give people numbers. We do well on crash tests."

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
But the truth of the matter is, you look at that car,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
it doesn't look like a Volvo,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
and it doesn't look like a Hummer.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
So, what I want you to think about for a few minutes

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
is: How would you convey safety of the BMW? Okay?

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
So now, while you're thinking about that let's move to a second task.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
The second task is fuel efficiency. Okay?

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Here's another puzzle for all of you.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
One person walks into a car lot,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
and they're thinking about buying this Toyota Yaris.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
They are saying, "This is 35 miles per gallon. I'm going to do

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
the environmentally right thing, I'm going to buy the Prius,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
50 miles per gallon."

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Another person walks into the lot,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
and they're about to buy a Hummer, nine miles per gallon,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
fully loaded, luxury.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
And they say, "You know what? Do I need turbo? Do I need this heavyweight car?"

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
I'm going to do something good for the environment.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
I'm going to take off some of that weight,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
and I'm going to buy a Hummer that's 11 miles per gallon."

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Which one of these people has done more for the environment?

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
See, you have a mental model.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Fifty versus 35, that's a big move. Eleven versus nine? Come on.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Turns out, go home and do the math,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
the nine to 11 is a bigger change. That person has saved more gallons.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Why? Because we don't care about miles per gallon, we care about

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
gallons per mile.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Think about how powerful that is if you're trying to encourage fuel efficiency.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Miles per gallon is the way we present things.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
If we want to encourage change of behavior,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
gallons per mile would have far more effectiveness.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Researchers have found these type of anomalies.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Okay, back to BMW. What should they do?

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
The problem BMW faces is this car looks safe.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
This car, which is my Mini, doesn't look that safe.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Here was BMW's brilliant insight, which they embodied into an ad campaign.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
They showed a BMW driving down the street.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
There's a truck on the right. Boxes fall out of the truck.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
The car swerves to avoid it, and therefore doesn't get into an accident.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
BWM realizes safety, in people's minds, has two components.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
You can be safe because when you're hit, you survive,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
or you can be safe because you avoid accidents.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Remarkably successful campaign, but notice the power of it.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
It harnesses something you already believe.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Now, even if I persuaded you to do something,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
it's hard sometimes to actually get action as a result.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
You all probably intended to wake up,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
I don't know, 6:30, 7 a.m.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
This is a battle we all fight every day,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
along with trying to get to the gym.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Now, this is an example of that battle,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
and makes us realize intentions don't always translate into action,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
and so one of the fundamental challenges

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
is how we would actually do that. OK?

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
So, let me now talk about the last mile problem.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
So far, I've been pretty negative.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
I've been trying to show you the oddities of human behavior.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
And I think maybe I'm being too negative.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Maybe it's the diarrhea.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Maybe the last mile problem really should be thought of

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
as the last mile opportunity.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Let's go back to diabetes.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
This is a typical insulin injection.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Now, carrying this thing around is complicated.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
You gotta carry the bottle, you gotta carry the syringe.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
It's also painful.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Now, you may think to yourself, "Well, if my eyes depended on it,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
you know, I would obviously use it every day."

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
But the pain, the discomfort,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
you know, paying attention, remembering to put it in your purse

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
when you go on a long trip:

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
These are the day-to-day of life, and they do pose problems.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Here is an innovation, a design innovation.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
This is a pen, it's called an insulin pen, preloaded.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000
The needle is particularly sharp.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
You just gotta carry this thing around.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
It's much easier to use, much less painful.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Anywhere between five and 10 percent increase in adherence,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
just as a result of this.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
That's what I'm talking about as a last mile opportunity.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
You see, we tend to think the problem is solved

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
when we solve the technology problem.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
But the human innovation, the human problem

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
still remains, and that's a great frontier that we have left.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
This isn't about the biology of people;

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
this is now about the brains, the psychology of people,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
and innovation needs to continue all the way through

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
the last mile.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Here's another example of this.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
This is from a company called Positive Energy.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
This is about energy efficiency.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
We're spending a lot of time on fuel cells right now.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
What this company does is they send a letter

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
to households that say, "Here's your energy use,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
here's your neighbor's energy use: You're doing well." Smiley face.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
"You're doing worse." Frown.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
And what they find is just this letter, nothing else,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
has a two to three percent reduction in electricity use.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
And you want to think about the social value of that

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
in terms of carbon offsets, reduced electricity,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
900 million dollars per year.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Why? Because for free,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
this isn't a new technology, this is a letter --

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
we're getting a Big Bang in behavior.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
So, how do we tackle the last mile?

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
I think this tells us there is an opportunity.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
And I think to tackle it, we need to combine

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
psychology,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
marketing,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
art, we've seen that.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
But you know what we need to combine it with?

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
We need to combine this with the scientific method.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
See what's really puzzling and frustrating about the last mile, to me,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
is that the first 999 miles are all about science.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
No one would say, "Hey, I think this medicine works, go ahead and use it."

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
We have testing, we go to the lab, we try it again, we have refinement.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
But you know what we do on the last mile?

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
"Oh, this is a good idea. People will like this. Let's put it out there."

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
The amount of resources we put in are disparate.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
We put billions of dollars into fuel-efficient technologies.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
How much are we putting into

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
energy behavior change

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
in a credible, systematic, testing way?

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Now, I think that we're on the verge of something big.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
We're on the verge of a whole new social science.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
It's a social science that recognizes --

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
much like science recognizes the complexity of the body,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
biology recognizes the complexity of the body -- we'll recognize

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
the complexity of the human mind.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
The careful testing, retesting, design,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
are going to open up vistas of understanding,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
complexities, difficult things.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
And those vistas will both create new science,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
and fundamental change in the world as we see it, in the next hundred years.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
All right. Thank you very much.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
(Applause)

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Chris Anderson: Sendhil, thank you so much.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
So, this whole area is so fascinating.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
I mean, it sometimes feels, listening to behavioral economists

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
that they are kind of putting into place

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
academically, what great marketers

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
have sort of intuitively known for a long time.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
How much is your field talking to great marketers

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
about their insights into human psychology?

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Because they've seen it on the ground.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
Sendhil Mullainathan: Yeah, we spend a lot of time talking to marketers,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
and I think 60 percent of it is exactly what you say,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
there are insights to be gleaned there.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Forty percent of it is about what marketing is.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Marketing is selling an ad to a firm.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
So, in some sense, a lot of marketing is about

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
convincing a CEO, "This is a good ad campaign."

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
So, there is a little bit of slippage there.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
That's just a caveat. That's different from actually having an effective ad campaign.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
And one of the new movements in marketing is: How do we actually

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
measure effectiveness? Are we effective?

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000
CA: How you take your insights here

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
and actually get them integrated

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
into working business models on the ground,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
in Indian villages, for example?

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
SM: So, the scientific method I alluded to is pretty important.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
We work closely with companies that have operational capacity,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
or nonprofits that have operational capacity.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
And then we say, "Well, you want to get this behavior change.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Let's come up with a few ideas, test them,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
see which is working, go back, synthesize,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
and try to come up with a thing that works,"

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
and then we're able to scale with partners.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
It's kind of the model that has worked in other contexts.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
If you have biological problems

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
we try and fix it, see if it works, and then work the scale.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
CA: Alright Sendhil, thanks so much for coming to TED. Thank you.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
(Applause)
