00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
When my brother called me in December of 1998,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
he said, "The news does not look good."

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This is him on the screen.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
He'd just been diagnosed with ALS,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
which is a disease that the average lifespan is three years.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It paralyzes you. It starts by killing

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
the motor neurons in your spinal cord.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And you go from being a healthy,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
robust 29-year-old male

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
to someone that cannot breathe,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
cannot move, cannot speak.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
This has actually been, to me, a gift,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
because we began a journey

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
to learn a new way of thinking about life.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And even though Steven passed away three years ago

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
we had an amazing journey as a family.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
We did not even --

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I think adversity is not even the right word.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
We looked at this and we said, "We're going to do something with this

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
in an incredibly positive way."

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And I want to talk today

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
about one of the things that we decided to do,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
which was to think about a new way of approaching healthcare.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Because, as we all know here today,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
it doesn't work very well.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I want to talk about it in the context of a story.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
This is the story of my brother.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
But it's just a story. And I want to go beyond the story,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and go to something more.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
"Given my status, what is the best outcome

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I can hope to achieve, and how do I get there?"

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
is what we are here to do in medicine, is what everyone should do.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And those questions all have variables to them.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
All of our statuses are different.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
All of our hopes and dreams, what we want to accomplish,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
is different, and our paths will be different,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
they are all stories.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
But it's a story until we convert it to data

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and so what we do, this concept we had,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
was to take Steven's status, "What is my status?"

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and go from this concept of walking, breathing,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and then his hands, speak,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and ultimately happiness and function.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
So, the first set of pathologies, they end up in the stick man

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
on his icon,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
but the rest of them are really what's important here.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Because Steven, despite the fact that he was paralyzed,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
as he was in that pool, he could not walk,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
he could not use his arms -- that's why he had the little floaty things on them,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
did you see those? --

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
he was happy. We were at the beach,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
he was raising his son, and he was productive.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And we took this, and we converted it into data.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
But it's not a data point at that one moment in time.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
It is a data point of Steven in a context.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Here he is in the pool. But here he is healthy,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
as a builder: taller, stronger,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
got all the women, amazing guy.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Here he is walking down the aisle,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
but he can barely walk now, so it's impaired.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And he could still hold his wife's hand, but he couldn't do buttons on his clothes,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
can't feed himself.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And here he is, paralyzed completely,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
unable to breathe and move, over this time journey.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
These stories of his life, converted to data.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
He renovated my carriage house

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
when he was completely paralyzed, and unable to speak,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and unable to breathe, and he won an award for a historic restoration.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
So, here's Steven alone, sharing this story in the world.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
And this is the insight, the thing that we are

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
excited about,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
because we have gone away from the community that we are,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
the fact that we really do love each other and want to care for each other.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
We need to give to others to be successful.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
So, Steven is sharing this story,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
but he is not alone.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
There are so many other people sharing their stories.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Not stories in words, but stories in data and words.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And we convert that information into this structure,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
this understanding, this ability to convert

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
those stories into something that is computable,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
to which we can begin to change the way

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
medicine is done and delivered.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
We did this for ALS. We can do this for depression,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Parkinson's disease, HIV.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
These are not simple, they are not internet scalable;

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
they require thought and processes

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
to find the meaningful information about the disease.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
So, this is what it looks like when you go to the website.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
And I'm going to show you what Patients Like Me,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
the company that myself, my youngest brother

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
and a good friend from MIT started.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Here are the actual patients, there are 45,000 of them now,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
sharing their stories as data.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Here is an M.S. patient.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
His name is Mike, and he is uniformly impaired

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
on cognition, vision, walking, sensation.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Those are things that are different for each M.S. patient.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Each of them can have a different characteristic.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
You can see fibromyalgia, HIV, ALS, depression.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Look at this HIV patient down here, Zinny.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
It's two years of this disease. All of the symptoms are not there.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
But he is working to keep his CD4 count high

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
and his viral level low so he can make his life better.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
But you can aggregate this and you can discover things about treatments.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Look at this, 2,000 people almost, on Copaxone.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
These are patients currently on drugs,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
sharing data.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
I love some of these, physical exercise, prayer.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Anyone want to run a comparative effectiveness study

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
on prayer against something? Let's look at prayer.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
What I love about this, just sort of interesting design problems.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
These are why people pray.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Here is the schedule of how frequently they -- it's a dose.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
So, anyone want to see the 32 patients that pray for 60 minutes a day,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
and see if they're doing better, they probably are.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Here they are. It's an open network,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
everybody is sharing. We can see it all.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Or, I want to look at anxiety, because people are praying for anxiety.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And here is data on 15,000 people's current anxiety, right now.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
How they treat it,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
the drugs, the components of it,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
their side effects, all of it in a rich environment,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
and you can drill down and see the individuals.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
This amazing data allows us to drill down and see

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
what this drug is for --

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
1,500 people on this drug, I think. Yes.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
I want to talk to the 58 patients down here

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
who are taking four milligrams a day.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And I want to talk to the ones of those that have been doing

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000
it for more than two years.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
So, you can see the duration.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
All open, all available.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
I'm going to log in.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And this is my brother's profile.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
And this is a new version of our platform we're launching right now.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
This is the second generation. It's going to be in Flash.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
And you can see here, as this animates over,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Steven's actual data against the background of all other patients,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
against this information.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
The blue band is the 50th percentile. Steven is the 75th percentile,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
that he has non-genetic ALS.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
You scroll down in this profile and you can see

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
all of his prescription drugs,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
but more than that, in the new version, I can look at this interactively.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Wait, poor spinal capacity.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Doesn't this remind you of a great stock program?

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Wouldn't it be great if the technology we used to take care of ourselves

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
was as good as the technology we use to make money?

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Detrol. In the side effects for his drug,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
integrated into that, the stem cell transplant that he had,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.000
the first in the world, shared openly for anyone who wants to see it.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
I love here -- the cyberkinetics implant,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
which was, again, the only patient's data that was online and available.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
You can adjust the time scale. You can adjust the symptoms.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
You can look at the interaction between how I treat my ALS.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
So, you click down on the ALS tab there.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
I'm taking three drugs to manage it. Some of them are experimental.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
I can look at my constipation, how to manage it.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
I can see magnesium citrate, and the side effects

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
from that drug all integrated in the time

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
in which they're meaningful.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
But I want more.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
I don't want to just look at this cool device, I want to take this

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
data and make something even better.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
I want my brother's center of the universe and his symptoms

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
and his drugs,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
and all of the things that interact among those,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
the side effects, to be in this beautiful data galaxy

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
that we can look at in any way we want to understand it,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
so that we can take this information

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
and go beyond just this simple model

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
of what a record is.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
I don't even know what a medical record is.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
I want to solve a problem. I want an application.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
So, can I take this data -- rearrange yourself,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
put the symptoms in the left, the drugs across the top,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
tell me everything we know about Steven and everyone else,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
and what interacts.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Years after he's had these drugs,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
I learned that everything he did to manage his excess saliva,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
including some positive side effects that came from other drugs,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
were making his constipation worse.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
And if anyone's ever had severe constipation,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
and you don't understand how much of an impact that has on your life --

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
yes, that was a pun.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
You're trying to manage these,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
and this grid is available here,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
and we want to understand it.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
No one's ever had this kind of information.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
So, patients have this. We're for patients.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
This is all about patient health care, there was no doctors on our network.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
This is about the patients.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
So, how can we take this and bring them a tool

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
that they can go back and they can engage the medical system?

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
And we worked hard, and we thought about it and we said,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
"What's something we can use all the time,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
that we can use in the medical care system,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
that everyone will understand?"

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
So, the patients print it out,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
because hospitals usually block us

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
because they believe we are a social network.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
It's actually the most used feature on the website.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Doctors actually love this sheet, and they're actually really engaged.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
So, we went from this story of Steven

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
and his history to data, and then back to paper,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000
where we went back and engaged the medical care system.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
And here's another paper.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
This is a journal, PNAS --

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
I think it's the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
of the United States of America.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
You've seen multiple of these today, when everyone's bragging about

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
the amazing things they've done.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
This is a report about a drug called lithium.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Lithium, that is a drug used to treat bipolar disorder,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
that a group in Italy found

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
slowed ALS down in 16 patients, and published it.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Now, we'll skip the critiques of the paper.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
But the short story is: If you're a patient,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
you want to be on the blue line.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
You don't want to be on the red line, you want to be on the blue line.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Because the blue line is a better line. The red line

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
is way downhill, the blue line is a good line.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
So, you know we said -- we looked at this, and what I love also

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
is that people always accuse these Internet sites

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
of promoting bad medicine and having people do things irresponsibly.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
So, this is what happened when PNAS published this.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Ten percent of the people in our system took lithium.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Ten percent of the patients started taking lithium based on 16 patients of data

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
in a bad publication.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
And they call the Internet irresponsible.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Here's the implication of what happens.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
There's this one guy, named Humberto, from Brazil,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
who unfortunately passed away nine months ago,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
who said, "Hey, listen. Can you help us answer this question?

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Because I don't want to wait for the next trial, it's going to be years.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
I want to know now. Can you help us?"

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
So, we launched some tools, we let them track their blood levels.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
We let them share the data and exchange it.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
You know, a data network.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
And they said, you know, "Jamie, PLM,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
can you guys tell us whether this works or not?"

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
And we went around and we talked to people,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
and they said, "You can't run a clinical trial like this. You know?

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
You don't have the blinding, you don't have data,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
it doesn't follow the scientific method.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
It's never going to work. You can't do it."

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
So, I said, "Okay well we can't do that. Then we can do something harder."

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
(Laughter)

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
I can't say whether lithium works in all ALS patients,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
but I can say whether it works in Humberto.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
I bought a Mac about two years ago, I converted over,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
and I was so excited about this new feature of the time machine

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
that came in Leopard. And we said -- because it's really cool,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
you can go back and you can look at the entire history of your computer,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
and find everything you've lost, and I loved it.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000
And I said, "What if we built a time machine for patients,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
except instead of going backwards, we go forwards.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Can we find out what's going to happen to you,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
so that you can maybe change it?"

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
So, we did. We took all the patients like Humberto,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
That's the Apple background, we stole that because we didn't have time

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
to build our own. This is a real app by the way.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
This is not just graphics.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
And you take those data, and we find the patients like him, and we bring

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
their data together. And we bring their histories into it.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And then we say, "Well how do we line them all up?"

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
So, we line them all up so they go together

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
around the meaningful points,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
integrated across everything we know about the patient.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Full information, the entire course of their disease.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
And that's what is going to happen to Humberto,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
unless he does something.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
And he took lithium, and he went down the line.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
And it works almost every time.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Now, the ones that it doesn't work are interesting.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
But almost all the time it works.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
It's actually scary. It's beautiful.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
So, we couldn't run a clinical trial, we couldn't figure it out.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
But we could see whether it was going to work for Humberto.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
And yeah, all the clinicians in the audience will talk about power

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
and all the standard deviation. We'll do that later.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
But here is the answer

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
of the mean of the patients that actually decided

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
to take lithium.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
These are all the patients that started lithium.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
It's the Intent to Treat Curve.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000
You can see here, the blue dots on the top, the light ones,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
those are the people in the study in PNAS

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
that you wanted to be on. And the red ones are the ones,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
the pink ones on the bottom are the ones you didn't want to be.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
And the ones in the middle are all of our patients

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
from the start of lithium at time zero,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
going forward, and then going backward.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
So, you can see we matched them perfectly, perfectly.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Terrifyingly accurate matching.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
And going forward, you actually don't want to be a lithium patient this time.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
You're actually doing slightly worse -- not significantly,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
but slightly worse. You don't want to be a lithium patient this time.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
But you know, a lot of people dropped out,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
the trial, there is too much drop out.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Can we do the even harder thing? Can we go to the patients

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
that actually decided to stay on lithium,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
because they were so convinced they were getting better?

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
We asked our control algorithm,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
are those 69 patients -- by the way, you'll notice

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
that's four times the number of patients in the clinical trial --

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
can we look at those patients and say,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
"Can we match them with our time machine

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
to the other patients that are just like them,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
and what happens?"

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Even the ones that believed they were getting better

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
matched the controls exactly. Exactly.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Those little lines? That's the power.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
So, we -- I can't tell you lithium doesn't work. I can't tell you

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
that if you did it at a higher dose

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
or if you run the study proper -- I can tell you

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
that for those 69 people that took lithium,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
they didn't do any better than the people that were just like them,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
just like me,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
and that we had the power to detect that at about

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
a quarter of the strengths reported in the initial study.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
We did that one year ahead of the time

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
when the first clinical trial funded by the NIH

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
for millions of dollars failed for futility last week,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
and announced it.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
So, remember I told you about my brother's stem cell transplant.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
I never really knew whether it worked.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
And I put 100 million cells in his cisterna magna,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
in his lumbar cord,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
and filled out the IRBs and did all this work,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
and I never really knew.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
How did I not know?

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
I mean, I didn't know what was going to happen to him.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
I actually asked Tim, who is the quant in our group --

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
we actually searched for about a year to find someone

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
who could do the sort of math and statistics and modeling

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
in healthcare, couldn't find anybody. So, we went to the finance industry.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
And there are these guys who used to model the future

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
of interest rates, and all that kind of stuff.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
And some of them were available. So, we hired one.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
(Laughter)

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
We hired them, set them up, assisting at lab.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
I I.M. him things. That's the way I communicate with him,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
is like a little guy in a box. I I.M.ed Tim. I said,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
"Tim can you tell me whether my brother's stem cell transplant

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
worked or not?"

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
And he sent me this two days ago.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
It was that little outliers there. You see that guy that lived a long time?

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
We have to go talk to him. Because I'd like to know what happened.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Because something went different.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
But my brother didn't. My brother went straight down the line.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
It only works about 12 months.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
It's the first version of the time machine.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
First time we ever tried it. We'll try to get it better later

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
but 12 months so far.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
And, you know, I look at this,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
and I get really emotional.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
You look at the patients, you can drill in all the controls,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
you can look at them, you can ask them.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
And I found a woman that had --

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
we found her, she was odd because she had data

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
after she died.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
And her husband had come in and entered her last functional scores,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
because he knew how much she cared.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
And I am thankful.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
I can't believe that these people,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
years after my brother had died,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
helped me answer the question about whether

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
an operation I did, and spent millions of dollars on

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
years ago, worked or not.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
I wished it had been there

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
when I'd done it the first time,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
and I'm really excited that it's here now,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000
because the lab that I founded

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
has some data on a drug that might work,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
and I'd like to show it.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
I'd like to show it in real time, now,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
and I want to do that for all of the diseases that we can do that for.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
I've got to thank the 45,000 people

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
that are doing this social experiment with us.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
There is an amazing journey we are going on

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
to become human again,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
to be part of community again,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
to share of ourselves, to be vulnerable,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
and it's very exciting. So, thank you.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000
(Applause)
