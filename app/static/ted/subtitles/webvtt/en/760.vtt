00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.676
The problem I want to talk with you
about is really the problem of:

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.506
How does one supply health care
in a world in which cost is everything?

00:00:13.014 --> 00:00:14.251
How do you do that?

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:17.534
And the basic paradigm
we want to suggest to you,

00:00:17.558 --> 00:00:18.783
I want to suggest to you,

00:00:18.807 --> 00:00:22.479
is one in which you say
that in order to treat disease,

00:00:22.503 --> 00:00:25.875
you have to first know
what you're treating, that's diagnostics,

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:27.546
and then you have to do something.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.886
The program we're involved in is something
we call "Diagnostics for All,"

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.021
or "zero-cost diagnostics."

00:00:34.045 --> 00:00:37.459
How do you provide medically
relevant information

00:00:37.483 --> 00:00:40.107
at as close as possible to zero cost?

00:00:40.131 --> 00:00:41.361
How do you do it?

00:00:41.385 --> 00:00:43.176
Let me just give you two examples.

00:00:43.707 --> 00:00:49.573
The rigors of military medicine are not
so dissimilar from the third world:

00:00:49.597 --> 00:00:53.949
poor resources, a rigorous environment --
a series of problems --

00:00:53.973 --> 00:00:55.954
light weight and things of this kind.

00:00:55.978 --> 00:00:59.412
And also they're not so different
from the home health care

00:00:59.436 --> 00:01:01.841
and diagnostic system world.

00:01:01.865 --> 00:01:06.713
So, the technology I want to talk
about is for the third world,

00:01:06.737 --> 00:01:08.135
for the developing world,

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.700
but it has, I think,
much broader application,

00:01:10.724 --> 00:01:14.187
because information is so important
in the health care system.

00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:16.835
So you see two examples here.

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:22.608
One is a lab that is actually
a fairly high-end laboratory in Africa.

00:01:22.632 --> 00:01:26.936
The second is basically an entrepreneur
who is set up and doing who-knows-what

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.407
at a table in a market.

00:01:28.431 --> 00:01:31.378
I don't know what kind
of health care is delivered there.

00:01:31.402 --> 00:01:35.254
But it's not really
what is probably most efficient.

00:01:36.341 --> 00:01:38.974
What is our approach?

00:01:39.442 --> 00:01:44.967
The way in which one typically
approaches a problem of lowering cost,

00:01:44.991 --> 00:01:47.854
starting from the perspective
of the United States,

00:01:47.878 --> 00:01:50.021
is to take our solution,

00:01:50.045 --> 00:01:52.200
and then try to cut cost out of it.

00:01:52.763 --> 00:01:54.176
No matter how you do that,

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.706
you're not going to start
with a $100,000 instrument

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.151
and bring it down to no cost.

00:01:58.175 --> 00:01:59.348
It isn't going to work.

00:01:59.372 --> 00:02:02.231
So the approach we took
was the other way around, to ask:

00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:04.720
What is the cheapest possible stuff

00:02:04.744 --> 00:02:07.680
that you could make
a diagnostic system out of,

00:02:07.704 --> 00:02:10.251
and get useful information
and add function?

00:02:10.275 --> 00:02:12.272
And what we've chosen is paper.

00:02:12.296 --> 00:02:15.320
What you see here is a prototypic device.

00:02:15.344 --> 00:02:17.176
It's about a centimeter on the side.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.177
It's about the size of a fingernail.

00:02:19.201 --> 00:02:22.804
The lines around the edges are a polymer.

00:02:22.828 --> 00:02:24.670
It's made of paper.

00:02:24.694 --> 00:02:29.379
And paper, of course, wicks fluid,
as you know, paper, cloth --

00:02:29.403 --> 00:02:31.279
drop wine on the tablecloth,

00:02:31.303 --> 00:02:34.040
and the wine wicks all over everything.

00:02:34.064 --> 00:02:36.103
Put it on your shirt, it ruins the shirt.

00:02:36.127 --> 00:02:38.866
That's what a hydrophilic surface does.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.513
So in this device, the idea
is that you drip the bottom end of it

00:02:42.537 --> 00:02:45.176
in a drop of, in this case, urine.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.948
The fluid wicks its way
into those chambers at the top.

00:02:48.972 --> 00:02:53.176
The brown color indicates
the amount of glucose in the urine,

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.747
the blue color indicates the amount
of protein in the urine.

00:02:56.771 --> 00:02:59.807
And the combination of those two
is a first-order shot

00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:02.953
at a number of useful things
that you want.

00:03:02.977 --> 00:03:06.334
So, this is an example of a device
made from a simple piece of paper.

00:03:06.358 --> 00:03:08.618
Now, how simple can you make
the production?

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.965
Why do we choose paper?

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.369
There's an example
of the same thing on a finger,

00:03:14.393 --> 00:03:16.649
showing you basically what it looks like.

00:03:16.673 --> 00:03:19.101
One reason for using paper
is that it's everywhere.

00:03:19.125 --> 00:03:24.298
We have made these kinds of devices
using napkins and toilet paper

00:03:24.322 --> 00:03:26.552
and wraps, and all kinds of stuff.

00:03:26.576 --> 00:03:29.014
So the production capability is there.

00:03:29.038 --> 00:03:33.335
The second is, you can put lots and lots
of tests in a very small place.

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:36.178
I'll show you in a moment
that the stack of paper there

00:03:36.202 --> 00:03:38.934
would probably hold
something like 100,000 tests,

00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:40.699
something of that kind.

00:03:40.723 --> 00:03:43.568
And then finally, a point
you don't think of so much

00:03:43.592 --> 00:03:46.176
in developed world medicine:

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.879
it eliminates sharps.

00:03:47.903 --> 00:03:51.285
And what sharps means
is needles, things that stick.

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:53.603
If you've taken a sample
of someone's blood

00:03:53.627 --> 00:03:56.124
and the someone might have hepatitis C,

00:03:56.148 --> 00:03:58.695
you don't want to make a mistake
and stick it in you.

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:00.016
You don't want to do that.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.529
So how do you dispose of that?

00:04:01.553 --> 00:04:04.235
It's a problem everywhere,
and here, you simply burn it.

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:07.759
So it's a sort of a practical approach
to starting on things.

00:04:09.417 --> 00:04:13.073
Now, you say, "If paper is a good idea,

00:04:13.097 --> 00:04:15.060
other people have surely thought of it."

00:04:15.084 --> 00:04:16.966
And the answer is, of course, yes.

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:20.810
Those half of you, roughly, who are women,

00:04:20.834 --> 00:04:23.296
at some point may have had
a pregnancy test.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.304
And the most common of these
is in a device

00:04:27.328 --> 00:04:29.176
that looks like the thing on the left.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.692
It's something called
a lateral-flow immunoassay.

00:04:31.716 --> 00:04:33.176
In that particular test,

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.815
urine, either containing
a hormone called hCG,

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:40.176
does or does not flow
across a piece of paper.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.101
And there are two bars; one bar
indicates that the test is working,

00:04:44.125 --> 00:04:47.290
and if the second bar shows up,
you're pregnant.

00:04:47.314 --> 00:04:50.485
This is a terrific kind of test
in a binary world,

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:53.424
and the nice thing about pregnancy
is either you are pregnant

00:04:53.448 --> 00:04:54.602
or you're not pregnant;

00:04:54.626 --> 00:04:57.607
you're not partially pregnant
or thinking about being pregnant

00:04:57.631 --> 00:04:58.915
or something of that sort.

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:01.674
So it works very well there,
but it doesn't work very well

00:05:01.698 --> 00:05:03.784
when you need more
quantitative information.

00:05:03.808 --> 00:05:05.028
There are also dipsticks,

00:05:05.052 --> 00:05:06.798
but if you look at the dipsticks,

00:05:06.822 --> 00:05:09.035
they're for another kind
of urine analysis.

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:11.936
There are an awful lot of colors
and things like that.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.253
What do you actually do about that
in a difficult circumstance?

00:05:16.372 --> 00:05:20.681
So the approach we started with is to ask:

00:05:20.705 --> 00:05:24.176
Is it really practical
to make things of this sort?

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:28.487
And that problem is now,
in a purely engineering way, solved.

00:05:28.511 --> 00:05:32.060
And the procedure that we have
is simply to start with paper.

00:05:32.084 --> 00:05:35.630
You run it through a new kind
of printer called a wax printer.

00:05:35.654 --> 00:05:38.286
The wax printer does
what looks like printing.

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:39.468
It is printing.

00:05:39.492 --> 00:05:41.532
You put that on, you warm it a little bit,

00:05:41.556 --> 00:05:44.599
the wax prints through,
so it absorbs into the paper,

00:05:44.623 --> 00:05:46.767
and you end up with the device you want.

00:05:46.791 --> 00:05:49.870
The printers cost 800 bucks now.

00:05:49.894 --> 00:05:53.782
We estimate that if you were
to run them 24 hours a day,

00:05:53.806 --> 00:05:55.914
they'd make about 10 million tests a year.

00:05:55.938 --> 00:05:59.162
So it's a solved problem.
That particular problem is solved.

00:05:59.186 --> 00:06:01.962
And there is an example
of the kind of thing that you see.

00:06:01.986 --> 00:06:03.825
That's on a piece of 8 by 12 paper.

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:06.118
That takes about two seconds to make.

00:06:06.142 --> 00:06:08.784
And so I regard that as done.

00:06:08.808 --> 00:06:10.602
There's a very important issue here,

00:06:10.626 --> 00:06:15.044
which is that because it's a printer,
a color printer, it prints colors.

00:06:15.068 --> 00:06:16.592
That's what color printers do.

00:06:16.616 --> 00:06:19.382
I'll show you in a moment,
that's actually quite useful.

00:06:20.651 --> 00:06:23.176
Now, the next question
that you would like to ask is:

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.391
What would you like to measure?
What would you like to analyze?

00:06:26.415 --> 00:06:31.176
And the thing you'd most like to analyze,
we're a fair distance from.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.176
It's what's called
"fever of undiagnosed origin."

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.761
Someone comes into the clinic,
they have a fever, they feel bad.

00:06:38.785 --> 00:06:39.951
What do they have?

00:06:39.975 --> 00:06:43.377
Do they have TB? Do they have AIDS?
Do they have a common cold?

00:06:43.401 --> 00:06:44.615
The triage problem.

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:47.295
That's a hard problem for reasons
I won't go through.

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:50.861
There are an awful lot of things
that you'd like to distinguish among.

00:06:50.885 --> 00:06:53.087
But then there are a series of things --

00:06:53.111 --> 00:06:56.695
AIDS, hepatitis, malaria, TB, others --

00:06:56.719 --> 00:07:00.214
and simpler ones,
such as guidance of treatment.

00:07:00.238 --> 00:07:03.176
Now, even that's more
complicated than you think.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:07.415
A friend of mine works
in transcultural psychiatry,

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:09.545
and he is interested in the question

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:12.299
of why people do
and don't take their meds.

00:07:12.323 --> 00:07:15.898
So Dapsone, or something like that,
you have to take for a while.

00:07:15.922 --> 00:07:19.538
He has a wonderful story
of talking to a villager in India

00:07:19.562 --> 00:07:20.713
and saying,

00:07:20.737 --> 00:07:22.543
"Have you taken your Dapsone?" "Yes."

00:07:22.567 --> 00:07:24.433
"Have you taken it every day?" "Yes."

00:07:24.457 --> 00:07:26.411
"Have you taken if for a month?" "Yes."

00:07:26.435 --> 00:07:27.936
What the guy actually meant

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.862
was that he'd fed a 30-day dose of Dapsone
to his dog that morning.

00:07:31.886 --> 00:07:33.011
(Laughter)

00:07:33.035 --> 00:07:36.791
And he was telling the truth,
because in a different culture,

00:07:36.815 --> 00:07:39.389
the dog is a surrogate for you;

00:07:39.413 --> 00:07:42.556
"today," "this month,"
"since the rainy season" --

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.064
there are lots of opportunities
for misunderstanding.

00:07:45.088 --> 00:07:46.095
(Laughter)

00:07:46.119 --> 00:07:49.683
And so an issue here is to,
in some cases, figure out

00:07:49.707 --> 00:07:53.818
how to deal with matters
that seem uninteresting, like compliance.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:58.705
Now, take a look
at what a typical test looks like.

00:07:59.419 --> 00:08:03.176
Prick a finger, you get some blood --
about 50 microliters.

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.031
That's about all you're going to get,

00:08:05.055 --> 00:08:09.031
because you can't use
the usual sort of systems.

00:08:09.585 --> 00:08:11.259
You can't manipulate it very well;

00:08:11.283 --> 00:08:13.399
I'll show something
about that in a moment.

00:08:13.423 --> 00:08:16.176
So you take the drop of blood,
no further manipulations,

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.983
you put it on a little device,

00:08:18.007 --> 00:08:22.680
the device filters out the blood cells,
lets the serum go through,

00:08:22.704 --> 00:08:26.465
and you get a series of colors
down in the bottom there.

00:08:26.489 --> 00:08:30.648
And the colors indicate
"disease" or "normal."

00:08:30.672 --> 00:08:32.354
But even that's complicated,

00:08:32.378 --> 00:08:35.979
because to me, colors
might indicate "normal,"

00:08:36.003 --> 00:08:40.963
but after all, we're all suffering
from probably an excess of education.

00:08:40.987 --> 00:08:45.574
What do you do about something
which requires quantitative analysis?

00:08:45.598 --> 00:08:48.280
And so the solution
that we and many other people

00:08:48.304 --> 00:08:49.915
are thinking about there,

00:08:49.939 --> 00:08:52.528
and at this point,
there is a dramatic flourish,

00:08:52.552 --> 00:08:55.724
and out comes the universal solution
to everything these days,

00:08:55.748 --> 00:08:56.905
which is a cell phone --

00:08:56.929 --> 00:08:58.927
in this particular case, a camera phone.

00:08:58.951 --> 00:09:03.176
They're everywhere --
six billion a month in India.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:08.722
And the idea is that what one does
is to take the device,

00:09:08.746 --> 00:09:11.176
you dip it, you develop the color,

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:14.425
you take a picture,
the picture goes to a central laboratory.

00:09:14.449 --> 00:09:16.176
You don't have to send out a doctor,

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.941
you send out somebody
who can just take the sample,

00:09:18.965 --> 00:09:22.690
and in the clinic either a doctor,
or ideally, a computer in this case,

00:09:22.714 --> 00:09:23.878
does the analysis.

00:09:23.902 --> 00:09:25.753
Turns out to work actually quite well,

00:09:25.777 --> 00:09:28.869
particularly when your color printer
has printed the color bars

00:09:28.893 --> 00:09:30.714
that indicate how things work.

00:09:30.738 --> 00:09:33.762
So my view of the health care
worker of the future

00:09:33.786 --> 00:09:36.353
is not a doctor, but an 18-year-old,

00:09:36.377 --> 00:09:39.129
otherwise unemployed, who has two things:

00:09:39.153 --> 00:09:41.236
a backpack full
of these tests and a lancet

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.176
to occasionally take a blood sample,

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.759
and an AK-47.

00:09:44.783 --> 00:09:47.379
And these are the things
that get him through his day.

00:09:47.403 --> 00:09:48.951
(Laughter)

00:09:50.112 --> 00:09:52.447
There's another very
interesting connection here,

00:09:52.471 --> 00:09:58.011
and that is, that what one wants to do
is pass through useful information

00:09:58.035 --> 00:10:01.566
over what is generally
a pretty awful telephone system.

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:04.176
It turns out there's an enormous
amount of information

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.579
already available on that subject,
which is the Mars Rover problem.

00:10:07.603 --> 00:10:11.470
How do you get back an accurate view
of the color on Mars

00:10:11.494 --> 00:10:15.280
if you have a really terrible
bandwidth to do it with?

00:10:15.304 --> 00:10:17.176
And the answer is not complicated,

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.741
but it's one which I don't want
to go through here,

00:10:19.765 --> 00:10:22.809
other than to say that the communication
systems for doing this

00:10:22.833 --> 00:10:24.534
are really pretty well understood.

00:10:24.558 --> 00:10:27.295
Also, a fact which you may not know

00:10:27.319 --> 00:10:31.053
is that the compute capability
of this thing is not so different

00:10:31.077 --> 00:10:33.916
from the compute capability
of your desktop computer.

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:37.601
This is a fantastic device
which is only beginning to be tapped.

00:10:37.625 --> 00:10:41.071
I don't know whether the idea
of one computer, one child

00:10:41.095 --> 00:10:42.246
makes any sense.

00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:44.176
Here's the computer of the future,

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.401
because this screen is already there
and they're ubiquitous.

00:10:48.851 --> 00:10:52.088
All right, let me show you just
a little bit about advanced devices.

00:10:52.112 --> 00:10:54.266
And we'll start by posing
a little problem.

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:57.687
What you see here
is another centimeter-sized device,

00:10:57.711 --> 00:11:01.694
and the different colors
are different colors of dye.

00:11:01.718 --> 00:11:02.896
And you notice something

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.619
which might strike you
as a little bit interesting,

00:11:05.643 --> 00:11:08.500
which is, the yellow seems to disappear,

00:11:08.524 --> 00:11:11.013
get through the blue,
and then get through the red.

00:11:11.037 --> 00:11:12.190
How does that happen?

00:11:12.214 --> 00:11:14.789
How do you make something
flow through something?

00:11:14.813 --> 00:11:17.008
And, of course the answer is, "You don't."

00:11:17.032 --> 00:11:18.775
You make it flow under and over.

00:11:18.799 --> 00:11:19.960
But now the question is:

00:11:19.984 --> 00:11:23.526
How do you make it flow
under and over in a piece of paper?

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:26.496
The answer is that what you do --

00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.176
and the details are not
terribly important here --

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.091
is to make something more elaborate:

00:11:31.115 --> 00:11:33.192
You take several different
layers of paper,

00:11:33.216 --> 00:11:36.287
each one containing
its own little fluid system,

00:11:36.311 --> 00:11:40.900
and you separate them by pieces of,
literally, double-sided carpet tape,

00:11:40.924 --> 00:11:43.810
the stuff you use to stick
the carpets onto the floor.

00:11:43.834 --> 00:11:47.060
And the fluid will flow
from one layer into the next.

00:11:47.084 --> 00:11:50.176
It distributes itself,
flows through further holes,

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.789
distributes itself.

00:11:51.813 --> 00:11:55.054
And what you see,
at the lower right-hand side there,

00:11:55.078 --> 00:12:00.377
is a sample in which a single sample
of blood has been put on the top,

00:12:00.401 --> 00:12:02.911
and it has gone through
and distributed itself

00:12:02.935 --> 00:12:06.281
into these 16 holes on the bottom,

00:12:06.305 --> 00:12:09.009
in a piece of paper --
basically, it looks like a chip,

00:12:09.033 --> 00:12:10.771
two pieces of paper thick.

00:12:10.795 --> 00:12:12.278
And in this particular case,

00:12:12.302 --> 00:12:15.066
we were just interested
in the replicability of that.

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:17.394
But that is, in principle,
the way you solve

00:12:17.418 --> 00:12:19.574
the "fever of unexplained origin" problem,

00:12:19.598 --> 00:12:22.354
because each one of those spots
then becomes a test

00:12:22.378 --> 00:12:25.977
for a particular set
of markers of disease,

00:12:26.001 --> 00:12:28.267
and this will work in due course.

00:12:28.291 --> 00:12:31.607
Here is an example of a slightly
more complicated device.

00:12:31.631 --> 00:12:32.813
There's the chip.

00:12:32.837 --> 00:12:34.053
You dip in a corner.

00:12:34.077 --> 00:12:35.624
The fluid goes into the center.

00:12:35.648 --> 00:12:39.431
It distributes itself out
into these various wells or holes

00:12:39.455 --> 00:12:40.691
and turns color,

00:12:40.715 --> 00:12:43.408
all done with paper and carpet tape.

00:12:43.432 --> 00:12:45.589
So it's, I think, as low-cost

00:12:45.613 --> 00:12:48.440
as we're likely to be able
to come up and make things.

00:12:49.432 --> 00:12:52.728
Now, I have two last
little stories to tell you

00:12:52.752 --> 00:12:55.362
in finishing off this business.

00:12:55.386 --> 00:12:56.551
This is one:

00:12:56.575 --> 00:12:59.016
One of the things
you occasionally need to do

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.687
is separate blood cells from serum.

00:13:02.874 --> 00:13:04.559
And the question was,

00:13:04.583 --> 00:13:06.684
here we do it by taking a sample,

00:13:06.708 --> 00:13:10.570
we put it in a centrifuge, we spin it,

00:13:10.594 --> 00:13:13.061
and you get blood cells out.

00:13:13.085 --> 00:13:14.244
Terrific.

00:13:14.268 --> 00:13:17.715
What happens if you don't have
electricity, a centrifuge, and whatever?

00:13:17.739 --> 00:13:20.255
And we thought for a while
of how you might do this,

00:13:20.279 --> 00:13:22.916
and the way, in fact, you do it,
is what's shown here.

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:27.547
You get an eggbeater, which is everywhere,
and you saw off a blade,

00:13:27.571 --> 00:13:30.054
and then you take tubing,
and you stick it on that.

00:13:30.078 --> 00:13:32.818
You put the blood in,
somebody sits there and spins it.

00:13:32.842 --> 00:13:34.961
It works really, really well.

00:13:34.985 --> 00:13:37.399
And we sat down,
we did the physics of eggbeaters

00:13:37.423 --> 00:13:40.500
and self-aligning tubes
and all the rest of that kind of thing,

00:13:40.524 --> 00:13:41.986
and sent it off to a journal.

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:43.332
We were very proud of this,

00:13:43.356 --> 00:13:46.218
particularly the title,
which was "Eggbeater as Centrifuge."

00:13:46.242 --> 00:13:47.316
(Laughter)

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:48.491
And we sent it off,

00:13:48.515 --> 00:13:50.422
and by return mail, it came back.

00:13:50.446 --> 00:13:52.176
I called up the editor and I said,

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.322
"What's going on? How is this possible?"

00:13:54.346 --> 00:13:57.480
The editor said, with enormous disdain,

00:13:57.504 --> 00:13:58.947
"I read this.

00:13:58.971 --> 00:14:02.727
And we're not going to publish it,
because we only publish science."

00:14:02.751 --> 00:14:04.164
(Laughter)

00:14:04.188 --> 00:14:05.657
And it's an important issue,

00:14:05.681 --> 00:14:09.079
because it means
that we have to, as a society,

00:14:09.103 --> 00:14:11.080
think about what we value.

00:14:11.104 --> 00:14:13.888
And if it's just papers
and Phys. Rev. letters,

00:14:13.912 --> 00:14:15.155
we've got a problem.

00:14:15.818 --> 00:14:19.048
Here is another example
of something which is --

00:14:19.072 --> 00:14:21.113
this is a little spectrophotometer.

00:14:21.137 --> 00:14:24.427
It measures the absorption
of light in a sample.

00:14:24.451 --> 00:14:25.930
The neat thing about this is,

00:14:25.954 --> 00:14:29.645
you have a light source that flickers
on and off at about 1,000 hertz,

00:14:29.669 --> 00:14:33.338
another light source
that detects that light at 1,000 hertz,

00:14:33.362 --> 00:14:36.176
and so you can run this system
in broad daylight.

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.269
It performs about equivalently

00:14:38.293 --> 00:14:42.862
to a system that's on the order
of 100,000 dollars.

00:14:42.886 --> 00:14:44.047
It costs 50 dollars.

00:14:44.071 --> 00:14:48.176
We can probably make it for 50 cents
if we put our mind to it.

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.073
Why doesn't somebody do it?

00:14:50.097 --> 00:14:51.248
The answer is:

00:14:51.272 --> 00:14:54.542
How do you make a profit
in a capitalist system, doing that?

00:14:54.566 --> 00:14:55.858
Interesting problem.

00:14:57.315 --> 00:15:02.268
So, let me finish by saying
that we've thought about this

00:15:02.292 --> 00:15:04.494
as a kind of engineering problem.

00:15:04.518 --> 00:15:08.900
And we've asked: What
is the scientific unifying idea here?

00:15:08.924 --> 00:15:11.048
And we've decided
we should think about this

00:15:11.072 --> 00:15:14.176
not so much in terms of cost,
but in terms of simplicity.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.778
Simplicity is a neat word.

00:15:15.802 --> 00:15:18.176
You've got to think
about what simplicity means.

00:15:18.755 --> 00:15:19.911
I know what it is,

00:15:19.935 --> 00:15:22.112
but I don't actually know what it means.

00:15:22.136 --> 00:15:24.233
So I actually was interested
enough in this

00:15:24.257 --> 00:15:28.010
to put together several groups of people.

00:15:28.644 --> 00:15:31.176
The most recent involved
a couple of people at MIT,

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.320
one of them being
an exceptionally bright kid

00:15:33.344 --> 00:15:36.054
who is one of the very
few people I would think of

00:15:36.078 --> 00:15:37.467
who's an authentic genius.

00:15:37.491 --> 00:15:41.541
We all struggled for an entire day
to think about simplicity.

00:15:41.565 --> 00:15:45.747
And I want to give you the answer
of this deep scientific thought.

00:15:45.771 --> 00:15:47.104
[What is simplicity?

00:15:47.128 --> 00:15:48.715
"It's impossible to f..k it up"]

00:15:48.739 --> 00:15:49.788
(Laughter)

00:15:49.812 --> 00:15:52.262
So, in a sense, you get what you pay for.

00:15:52.286 --> 00:15:53.795
Thank you very much.

00:15:53.819 --> 00:15:55.904
(Applause)
