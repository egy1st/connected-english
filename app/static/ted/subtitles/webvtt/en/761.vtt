00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm a cancer doctor, and I walked out of my office

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and walked by the pharmacy in the hospital three or four years ago,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and this was the cover of Fortune magazine

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
sitting in the window of the pharmacy.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And so, as a cancer doctor, you look at this,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and you get a little bit downhearted.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
But when you start to read the article by Cliff,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
who himself is a cancer survivor,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
who was saved by a clinical trial

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
where his parents drove him from New York City to upstate New York

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
to get an experimental therapy for --

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
at the time -- Hodgkin's disease, which saved his life,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
he makes remarkable points here.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And the point of the article was that we have gotten

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
reductionist in our view of biology,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
in our view of cancer.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
For the last 50 years, we have focused on treating

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
the individual gene

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
in understanding cancer, not in controlling cancer.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
So, this is an astounding table.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And this is something that sobers us in our field everyday

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
in that, obviously, we've made remarkable impacts

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
on cardiovascular disease,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
but look at cancer. The death rate in cancer

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
in over 50 years hasn't changed.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
We've made small wins in diseases like chronic myelogenous leukemia,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
where we have a pill that can put 100 percent of people in remission,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
but in general, we haven't made an impact at all in the war on cancer.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So, what I'm going to tell you today,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
is a little bit of why I think that's the case,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and then go out of my comfort zone

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and tell you where I think it's going,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
where a new approach -- that we hope to push forward

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
in terms of treating cancer.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Because this is wrong.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
So, what is cancer, first of all?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Well, if one has a mass or an abnormal blood value, you go to a doctor,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
they stick a needle in.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
They way we make the diagnosis today is by pattern recognition:

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Does it look normal? Does it look abnormal?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
So, that pathologist is just like looking at this plastic bottle.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
This is a normal cell. This is a cancer cell.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
That is the state-of-the-art today in diagnosing cancer.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
There's no molecular test,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
there's no sequencing of genes that was referred to yesterday,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
there's no fancy looking at the chromosomes.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
This is the state-of-the-art and how we do it.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000
You know, I know very well, as a cancer doctor, I can't treat advanced cancer.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.000
So, as an aside, I firmly believe in the field of trying to identify cancer early.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
It is the only way you can start to fight cancer, is by catching it early.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
We can prevent most cancers.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
You know, the previous talk alluded to preventing heart disease.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
We could do the same in cancer.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
I co-founded a company called Navigenics,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
where, if you spit into a tube --

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and we can look look at 35 or 40 genetic markers for disease,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
all of which are delayable in many of the cancers --

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
you start to identify what you could get,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and then we can start to work to prevent them.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Because the problem is, when you have advanced cancer,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
we can't do that much today about it, as the statistics allude to.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
So, the thing about cancer is that it's a disease of the aged.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Why is it a disease of the aged?

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Because evolution doesn't care about us after we've had our children.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
See, evolution protected us during our childbearing years

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
and then, after age 35 or 40 or 45,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
it said "It doesn't matter anymore, because they've had their progeny."

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
So if you look at cancers, it is very rare -- extremely rare --

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
to have cancer in a child, on the order of thousands of cases a year.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
As one gets older? Very, very common.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Why is it hard to treat?

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Because it's heterogeneous,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
and that's the perfect substrate for evolution within the cancer.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
It starts to select out for those bad, aggressive cells,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
what we call clonal selection.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
But, if we start to understand

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
that cancer isn't just a molecular defect, it's something more,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
then we'll get to new ways of treating it, as I'll show you.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
So, one of the fundamental problems we have in cancer

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
is that, right now, we describe it by a number of adjectives, symptoms:

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
"I'm tired, I'm bloated, I have pain, etc."

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
You then have some anatomic descriptions,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
you get that CT scan: "There's a three centimeter mass in the liver."

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
You then have some body part descriptions:

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
"It's in the liver, in the breast, in the prostate."

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
And that's about it.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
So, our dictionary for describing cancer is very, very poor.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
It's basically symptoms.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
It's manifestations of a disease.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
What's exciting is that over the last two or three years,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
the government has spent 400 million dollars,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
and they've allocated another billion dollars,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
to what we call the Cancer Genome Atlas Project.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
So, it is the idea of sequencing all of the genes in the cancer,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and giving us a new lexicon, a new dictionary to describe it.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
You know, in the mid-1850's in France,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
they started to describe cancer by body part.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
That hasn't changed in over 150 years.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
It is absolutely archaic that we call cancer

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
by prostate, by breast, by muscle.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
It makes no sense, if you think about it.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
So, obviously, the technology is here today,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
and, over the next several years, that will change.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
You will no longer go to a breast cancer clinic.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000
You will go to a HER2 amplified clinic, or an EGFR activated clinic,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
and they will go to some of the pathogenic lesions

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000
that were involved in causing this individual cancer.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
So, hopefully, we will go from being the art of medicine

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
more to the science of medicine,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
and be able to do what they do in infectious disease,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
which is look at that organism, that bacteria,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
and then say, "This antibiotic makes sense,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000
because you have a particular bacteria that will respond to it."

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
When one is exposed to H1N1, you take Tamiflu,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
and you can remarkably decrease the severity of symptoms

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
and prevent many of the manifestations of the disease.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Why? Because we know what you have, and we know how to treat it --

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
although we can't make vaccine in this country, but that's a different story.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
The Cancer Genome Atlas is coming out now.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
The first cancer was done, which was brain cancer.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
In the next month, the end of December, you'll see ovarian cancer,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and then lung cancer will come several months after.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
There's also a field of proteomics that I'll talk about in a few minutes,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
which I think is going to be the next level

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
in terms of understanding and classifying disease.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
But remember, I'm not pushing genomics,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
proteomics, to be a reductionist.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
I'm doing it so we can identify what we're up against.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
And there's a very important distinction there that we'll get to.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
In health care today, we spend most of the dollars --

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
in terms of treating disease --

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
most of the dollars in the last two years of a person's life.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
We spend very little, if any, dollars in terms of identifying what we're up against.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
If you could start to move that, to identify what you're up against,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
you're going to do things a hell of a lot better.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
If we could even take it one step further and prevent disease,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
we can take it enormously the other direction,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
and obviously, that's where we need to go, going forward.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
So, this is the website of the National Cancer Institute.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
And I'm here to tell you, it's wrong.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
So, the website of the National Cancer Institute

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
says that cancer is a genetic disease.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
The website says, "If you look, there's an individual mutation,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
and maybe a second, and maybe a third,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
and that is cancer."

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
But, as a cancer doc, this is what I see.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
This isn't a genetic disease.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
So, there you see, it's a liver with colon cancer in it,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
and you see into the microscope a lymph node

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
where cancer has invaded.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
You see a CT scan where cancer is in the liver.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Cancer is an interaction of a cell

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
that no longer is under growth control with the environment.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
It's not in the abstract; it's the interaction with the environment.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
It's what we call a system.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
The goal of me as a cancer doctor is not to understand cancer.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
And I think that's been the fundamental problem over the last five decades,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
is that we have strived to understand cancer.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
The goal is to control cancer.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
And that is a very different optimization scheme,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
a very different strategy for all of us.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
I got up at the American Association of Cancer Research,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
one of the big cancer research meetings, with 20,000 people there,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
and I said, "We've made a mistake.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
We've all made a mistake, myself included,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
by focusing down, by being a reductionist.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
We need to take a step back."

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
And, believe it or not, there were hisses in the audience.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
People got upset, but this is the only way we're going to go forward.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
You know, I was very fortunate to meet Danny Hillis a few years ago.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
We were pushed together, and neither one of us really wanted to meet the other.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
I said, "Do I really want to meet a guy from Disney, who designed computers?"

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
And he was saying: Does he really want to meet another doctor?

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
But people prevailed on us, and we got together,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
and it's been transformative in what I do, absolutely transformative.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
We have designed, and we have worked on the modeling --

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
and much of these ideas came from Danny and from his team --

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
the modeling of cancer in the body as complex system.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
And I'll show you some data there

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
where I really think it can make a difference and a new way to approach it.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
The key is, when you look at these variables and you look at this data,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
you have to understand the data inputs.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
You know, if I measured your temperature over 30 days,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
and I asked, "What was the average temperature?"

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
and it came back at 98.7, I would say, "Great."

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
But if during one of those days

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
your temperature spiked to 102 for six hours,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
and you took Tylenol and got better, etc.,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
I would totally miss it.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
So, one of the problems, the fundamental problems in medicine

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
is that you and I, and all of us,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
we go to our doctor once a year.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
We have discrete data elements; we don't have a time function on them.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Earlier it was referred to this direct life device.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
You know, I've been using it for two and a half months.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
It's a staggering device, not because it tells me

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
how many kilocalories I do every day,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
but because it looks, over 24 hours, what I've done in a day.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
And I didn't realize that for three hours I'm sitting at my desk,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
and I'm not moving at all.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000
And a lot of the functions in the data that we have as input systems here

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
are really different than we understand them,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
because we're not measuring them dynamically.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
And so, if you think of cancer as a system,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
there's an input and an output and a state in the middle.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
So, the states, are equivalent classes of history,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
and the cancer patient, the input, is the environment,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
the diet, the treatment, the genetic mutations.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
The output are our symptoms:

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Do we have pain? Is the cancer growing? Do we feel bloated, etc.?

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Most of that state is hidden.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
So what we do in our field is we change and input,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
we give aggressive chemotherapy,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
and we say, "Did that output get better? Did that pain improve, etc.?"

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
And so, the problem is that it's not just one system,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
it's multiple systems on multiple scales.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
It's a system of systems.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
And so, when you start to look at emergent systems,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
you can look at a neuron under a microscope.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
A neuron under the microscope is very elegant

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
with little things sticking out and little things over here,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
but when you start to put them together in a complex system,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
and you start to see that it becomes a brain,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
and that brain can create intelligence,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
what we're talking about in the body,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
and cancer is starting to model it like a complex system.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Well, the bad news is that these robust --

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
and robust is a key word --

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
emergent systems are very hard to understand in detail.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
The good news is you can manipulate them.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
You can try to control them

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
without that fundamental understanding of every component.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
One of the most fundamental clinical trials in cancer

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
came out in February in the New England Journal of Medicine,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
where they took women who were pre-menopausal with breast cancer.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
So, about the worst kind of breast cancer you can get.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
They had gotten their chemotherapy,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
and then they randomized them,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
where half got placebo,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
and half got a drug called Zoledronic acid that builds bone.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
It's used to treat osteoporosis,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
and they got that twice a year.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
They looked and, in these 1,800 women,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
given twice a year a drug that builds bone,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000
you reduce the recurrence of cancer by 35 percent.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Reduce occurrence of cancer by a drug

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
that doesn't even touch the cancer.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
So the notion, you change the soil, the seed doesn't grow as well.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
You change that system,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
and you could have a marked effect on the cancer.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Nobody has ever shown -- and this will be shocking --

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
nobody has ever shown that most chemotherapy

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
actually touches a cancer cell.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
It's never been shown.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
There's all these elegant work in the tissue culture dishes,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
that if you give this cancer drug, you can do this effect to the cell,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
but the doses in those dishes are nowhere near

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
the doses that happen in the body.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
If I give a woman with breast cancer a drug called Taxol

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
every three weeks, which is the standard,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
about 40 percent of women with metastatic cancer

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
have a great response to that drug.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
And a response is 50 percent shrinkage.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Well, remember that's not even an order of magnitude,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
but that's a different story.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
They then recur, I give them that same drug every week.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Another 30 percent will respond.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
They then recur, I give them that same drug

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
over 96 hours by continuous infusion,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
another 20 or 30 percent will respond.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
So, you can't tell me it's working by the same mechanism in all three size.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
It's not. We have no idea the mechanism.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
So the idea that chemotherapy may just be disrupting

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
that complex system,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
just like building bone disrupted that system and reduced recurrence,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
chemotherapy may work by that same exact way.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
The wild thing about that trial also,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:45.000
was that it reduced new primaries, so new cancers, by 30 percent also.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
So, the problem is, yours and mine, all of our systems are changing.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
They're dynamic.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
I mean, this is a scary slide, not to take an aside,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
but it looks at obesity in the world.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
And I'm sorry if you can't read the numbers, they're kind of small.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
But, if you start to look at it, that red, that dark color there,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
more than 75 percent of the population

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
of those countries are obese.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Look a decade ago, look two decades ago: markedly different.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
So, our systems today are dramatically different

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
than our systems a decade or two ago.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
So the diseases we have today,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
which reflect patterns in the system over the last several decades,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
are going to change dramatically over the next decade or so

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
based on things like this.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:47.000
So, this picture, although it is beautiful, is a 40-gigabyte picture

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
of the whole proteome.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000
So this is a drop of blood that has gone through a superconducting magnet,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
and we're able to get resolution

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
where we can start to see all of the proteins in the body.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
We can start to see that system.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Each of the red dots are where a protein has actually been identified.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
The power of these magnets, the power of what we can do here,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:12.000
is that we can see an individual neutron with this technology.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
So, again, this is stuff we're doing with Danny Hillis

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
and a group called Applied Proteomics,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
where we can start to see individual neutron differences,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
and we can start to look at that system like we never have before.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
So, instead of a reductionist view, we're taking a step back.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:33.000
So this is a woman, 46 years old,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
who had recurrent lung cancer.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
It was in her brain, in her lungs, in her liver.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
She had gotten Carboplatin Taxol, Carboplatin Taxotere,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Gemcitabine, Navelbine:

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Every drug we have she had gotten, and that disease continued to grow.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
She had three kids under the age of 12,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
and this is her CT scan.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
And so what this is, is we're taking a cross-section of her body here,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
and you can see in the middle there is her heart,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
and to the side of her heart on the left there is this large tumor

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:13.000
that will invade and will kill her, untreated, in a matter of weeks.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000
She goes on a pill a day that targets a pathway,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
and again, I'm not sure if this pathway was in the system, in the cancer,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:28.000
but it targeted a pathway, and a month later, pow, that cancer's gone.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Six months later it's still gone.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000
That cancer recurred, and she passed away three years later from lung cancer,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
but she got three years from a drug

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
whose symptoms predominately were acne.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
That's about it.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000
So, the problem is that the clinical trial was done,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
and we were a part of it,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
and in the fundamental clinical trial --

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
the pivotal clinical trial we call the Phase Three,

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
we refused to use a placebo.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Would you want your mother, your brother, your sister

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000
to get a placebo if they had advanced lung cancer and had weeks to live?

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
And the answer, obviously, is not.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
So, it was done on this group of patients.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:13.000
Ten percent of people in the trial had this dramatic response that was shown here,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
and the drug went to the FDA,

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
and the FDA said, "Without a placebo,

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:23.000
how do I know patients actually benefited from the drug?"

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
So the morning the FDA was going to meet,

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
this was the editorial in the Wall Street Journal.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
(Laughter)

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
And so, what do you know, that drug was approved.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
The amazing thing is another company did the right scientific trial,

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
where they gave half placebo and half the drug.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
And we learned something important there.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
What's interesting is they did it in South America and Canada,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
where it's "more ethical to give placebos."

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
They had to give it also in the U.S. to get approval,

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
so I think there were three U.S. patients

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
in upstate New York who were part of the trial.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
But they did that, and what they found

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
is that 70 percent of the non-responders

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000
lived much longer and did better than people who got placebo.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
So it challenged everything we knew in cancer,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
is that you don't need to get a response.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
You don't need to shrink the disease.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
If we slow the disease, we may have more of a benefit

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000
on patient survival, patient outcome, how they feel,

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
than if we shrink the disease.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
The problem is that, if I'm this doc, and I get your CT scan today

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
and you've got a two centimeter mass in your liver,

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000
and you come back to me in three months and it's three centimeters,

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
did that drug help you or not?

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
How do I know?

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
Would it have been 10 centimeters, or am I giving you a drug

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
with no benefit and significant cost?

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
So, it's a fundamental problem.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.000
And, again, that's where these new technologies can come in.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000
And so, the goal obviously is that you go into your doctor's office --

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
well, the ultimate goal is that you prevent disease, right?

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
The ultimate goal is that you prevent any of these things from happening.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000
That is the most effective, cost-effective,

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
best way we can do things today.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000
But if one is unfortunate to get a disease,

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
you'll go into your doctor's office, he or she will take a drop of blood,

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
and we will start to know how to treat your disease.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000
The way we've approached it is the field of proteomics,

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
again, this looking at the system.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
It's taking a big picture.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
The problem with technologies like this is

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
that if one looks at proteins in the body,

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000
there are 11 orders of magnitude difference

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000
between the high-abundant and the low-abundant proteins.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000
So, there's no technology in the world that can span 11 orders of magnitude.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000
And so, a lot of what has been done with people like Danny Hillis and others

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000
is to try to bring in engineering principles, try to bring the software.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000
We can start to look at different components along this spectrum.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.000
And so, earlier was talked about cross-discipline, about collaboration.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000
And I think one of the exciting things that is starting to happen now

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000
is that people from those fields are coming in.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000
Yesterday, the National Cancer Institute announced a new program

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
called the Physical Sciences and Oncology,

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000
where physicists, mathematicians, are brought in to think about cancer,

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
people who never approached it before.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000
Danny and I got 16 million dollars, they announced yesterday,

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
to try to attach this problem.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000
A whole new approach, instead of giving high doses of chemotherapy

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
by different mechanisms,

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:34.000
to try to bring technology to get a picture of what's actually happening in the body.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
So, just for two seconds, how these technologies work --

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
because I think it's important to understand it.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000
What happens is every protein in your body is charged,

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000
so the proteins are sprayed in, the magnet spins them around,

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
and then there's a detector at the end.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000
When it hit that detector is dependent on the mass and the charge.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000
And so we can accurately -- if the magnet is big enough,

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000
and your resolution is high enough --

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000
you can actually detect all of the proteins in the body

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000
and start to get an understanding of the individual system.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000
And so, as a cancer doctor,

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.000
instead of having paper in my chart, in your chart, and it being this thick,

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000
this is what data flow is starting to look like in our offices,

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000
where that drop of blood is creating gigabytes of data.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000
Electronic data elements are describing every aspect of the disease.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000
And certainly the goal is we can start to learn from every encounter

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.000
and actually move forward, instead of just having encounter and encounter,

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000
without fundamental learning.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:42.000
So, to conclude, we need to get away from reductionist thinking.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
We need to start to think differently and radically.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
And so, I implore everyone here: Think differently. Come up with new ideas.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000
Tell them to me or anyone else in our field,

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000
because over the last 59 years, nothing has changed.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000
We need a radically different approach.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000
You know, Andy Grove stepped down as chairman of the board at Intel --

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000
and Andy was one of my mentors, tough individual.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000
When Andy stepped down, he said,

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000
"No technology will win. Technology itself will win."

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000
And I'm a firm believer, in the field of medicine and especially cancer,

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000
that it's going to be a broad platform of technologies

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000
that will help us move forward

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000
and hopefully help patients in the near-term.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000
Thank you very much.
