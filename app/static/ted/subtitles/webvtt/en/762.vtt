00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
John Hockenberry: It's great to be here with you, Tom.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
And I want to start with a question

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
that has just been consuming me

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
since I first became familiar with your work.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
In you work there's always this kind of hybrid quality

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
of a natural force

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
in some sort of interplay with creative force.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Are they ever in equilibrium

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
in the way that you see your work?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Tom Shannon: Yeah, the subject matter that I'm looking for,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
it's usually to solve a question.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I had the question popped into my head:

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
What does the cone that connects the sun and the Earth look like

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
if you could connect the two spheres?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And in proportion, what would the size of the sphere

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and the length, and what would the taper be to the Earth?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And so I went about and made that sculpture,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
turning it out of solid bronze.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And I did one that was about 35 feet long.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
The sun end was about four inches in diameter,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and then it tapered over about 35 feet

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
to about a millimeter at the Earth end.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And so for me, it was really exciting

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
just to see what it looks like

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
if you could step outside and into a larger context,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
as though you were an astronaut,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and see these two things as an object,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
because they are so intimately bound,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and one is meaningless without the other.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
JH: Is there a relief

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
in playing with these forces?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And I'm wondering how much of a sense of discovery there is

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
in playing with these forces.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
TS: Well, like the magnetically levitated objects --

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
like that silver one there,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
that was the result

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
of hundreds of experiments with magnets,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
trying to find a way to make something float

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
with the least possible connection to the ground.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
So I got it down to just one tether

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
to be able to support that.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
JH: Now is this electromagnetic here, or are these static?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
TS: Those are permanent magnets, yeah.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
JH: Because if the power went out, there would just be a big noise.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
TS: Yeah.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
It's really unsatisfactory having plug-in art.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
JH: I agree.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
TS: The magnetic works

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
are a combination of gravity and magnetism,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
so it's a kind of mixture of these ambient forces

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
that influence everything.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
The sun has a tremendous field

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
that extends way beyond the planets

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
and the Earth's magnetic field protects us from the sun.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
So there's this huge

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
invisible shape structures

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
that magnetism takes in the universe.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
But with the pendulum,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
it allows me to manifest

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
these invisible forces

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
that are holding the magnets up.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
My sculptures

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
are normally very simplified.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
I try to refine them down

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
to very simple forms.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
But the paintings become very complex,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
because I think the fields

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
that are supporting them,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
they're billowing, and they're interpenetrating,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and they're interference patterns.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
JH: And they're non-deterministic.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
I mean, you don't know necessarily where you're headed when you begin,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
even though the forces can be calculated.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
So the evolution of this --

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I gather this isn't your first pendulum.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
TS: No. (JH: No.)

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
TS: The first one I did was in the late 70's,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and I just had a simple cone

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
with a spigot at the bottom of it.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
I threw it into an orbit,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
and it only had one color,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and when it got to the center, the paint kept running out,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
so I had to run in there,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
didn't have any control over the spigot remotely.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
So that told me right away: I need a remote control device.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
But then I started dreaming of having six colors.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
I sort of think about it as the DNA --

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
these colors, the red, blue, yellow,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
the primary colors and white and black.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
And if you put them together in different combinations --

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
just like printing in a sense,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
like how a magazine color is printed --

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and put them under certain forces,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
which is orbiting them

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
or passing them back and forth

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
or drawing with them,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
these amazing things started appearing.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
JH: It looks like we're loaded for bear here.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
TS: Yeah, well let's put a couple of canvases.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
I'll ask a couple of my sons

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
to set up the canvases here.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
I want to just say --

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
so this is Jack, Nick and Louie.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
JH: Thanks guys.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
TS: So here are the --

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
JH: All right, I'll get out of the way here.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
TS: I'm just going to throw this into an orbit

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
and see if I can paint everybody's shoes in the front.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
(Laughter)

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
JH: Whoa. That is ...

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
ooh, nice.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
TS: So something like this.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
I'm doing this as a demo,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
and it's more playful,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
but inevitably,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
all of this can be used.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
I can redeem this painting,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
just continuing on,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
doing layers upon layers.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And I keep it around for a couple of weeks,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
and I'm contemplating it,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
and I'll do another session with it

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
and bring it up to another level,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
where all of this

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
becomes the background, the depth of it.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
JH: That's fantastic.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
So the valves at the bottom of those tubes there

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
are like radio-controlled airplane valves.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
TS: Yes, they're servos with cams

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
that pinch these rubber tubes.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
And they can pinch them very tight and stop it,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
or you can have them wide open.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And all of the colors

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
come out one central port

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
at the bottom.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
You can always be changing colors, put aluminum paint,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
or I could put anything into this.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
It could be tomato sauce,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
or anything could be dispensed --

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
sand, powders or anything like that.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
JH: So many forces there.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
You've got gravity, you've got the centrifugal force,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
you've got the fluid dynamics.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Each of these beautiful paintings,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
are they images in and of themselves,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
or are they records

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
of a physical event

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
called the pendulum approaching the canvas?

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
TS: Well, this painting here,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
I wanted to do something very simple,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
a simple, iconic image

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
of two ripples interfering.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
So the one on the right was done first,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
and then the one on the left

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
was done over it.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
And then I left gaps

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
so you could see the one that was done before.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
And then when I did the second one,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
it really disturbed the piece --

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
these big blue lines

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
crashing through the center of it --

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
and so it created a kind of tension and an overlap.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000
There are lines in front of the one on the right,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
and there are lines behind the one on the left,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
and so it takes it into different planes.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
What it's also about,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
just the little events,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
the events of the interpenetration of --

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
JH: Two stars, or --

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
TS: Two things that happened --

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
there's an interference pattern, and then a third thing happens.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
There are shapes that come about

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
just by the marriage

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
of two events that are happening,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
and I'm very interested in that.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Like the occurrence of moire patterns.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Like this green one,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
this is a painting I did about 10 years ago,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
but it has some --

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
see, in the upper third --

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
there are these moires and interference patterns

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
that are radio kind of imagery.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And that's something that in painting

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
I've never seen done.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
I've never seen a representation

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
of a kind of radio interference patterns,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
which are so ubiquitous

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
and such an important part of our lives.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
JH: Is that a literal part of the image,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
or is my eye making that interference pattern --

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
is my eye completing that interference pattern?

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
TS: It is the paint actually,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
makes it real.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
It's really manifested there.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
If I throw a very concentric circle,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
or concentric ellipse,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
it just dutifully makes

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
these evenly spaced lines,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
which get closer and closer together,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
which describes how gravity works.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
There's something very appealing

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
about the exactitude of science

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
that I really enjoy.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
And I love the shapes that I see

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
in scientific observations

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
and apparatus,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
especially astronomical forms

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
and the idea of the vastness of it,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
the scale,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
is very interesting to me.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
My focus in recent years

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
has kind of shifted more toward biology.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Some of these paintings, when you look at them very close,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
odd things appear

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
that really look like horses or birds

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
or crocodiles, elephants.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
There are lots of things that appear.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
When you look into it, it's sort of like looking at cloud patterns,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
but sometimes they're very modeled and highly rendered.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
And then there are all these forms

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
that we don't know what they are,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
but they're equally well-resolved

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
and complex.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
So I think, conceivably, those could be predictive.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Because since it has the ability

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
to make forms

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
that look like forms that we're familiar with

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
in biology,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
it's also making other forms that we're not familiar with.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
And maybe it's the kind of forms

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
we'll discover underneath the surface of Mars,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
where there are probably lakes

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
with fish swimming under the surface.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
JH: Oh, let's hope so. Oh, my God, let's.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Oh, please, yes. Oh, I'm so there.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
You know, it seems

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
at this stage in your life,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
you also very personally

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
are in this state of confrontation

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
with a sort of dissonant --

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
I suppose it's an electromagnetic force

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
that somehow governs your Parkinson's

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
and this creative force

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
that is both the artist

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
who is in the here and now

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
and this sort of arc of your whole life.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Is that relevant to your work?

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
TS: As it turns out,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
this device kind of comes in handy,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
because I don't have to have

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
the fine motor skills to do,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
that I can operate slides,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
which is more of a mental process.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
I'm looking at it and making decisions:

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
It needs more red, it needs more blue,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
it needs a different shape.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
And so I make these creative decisions

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
and can execute them

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
in a much, much simpler way.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
I mean, I've got the symptoms.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
I guess Parkinson's kind of creeps up over the years,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
but at a certain point you start seeing the symptoms.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
In my case,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
my left hand has a significant tremor

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
and my left leg also.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
I'm left-handed, and so I draw.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
All my creations

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
really start on small drawings,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
which I have thousands of,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
and it's my way of just thinking.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
I draw with a simple pencil,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
and at first, the Parkinson's

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
was really upsetting,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
because I couldn't get the pencil to stand still.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
JH: So you're not a gatekeeper for these forces.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
You don't think of yourself as the master of these forces.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
You think of yourself as the servant.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
TS: Nature is -- well, it's a godsend.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
It just has so much in it.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
And I think nature

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
wants to express itself

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
in the sense that we are nature,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
humans are of the universe.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
The universe is in our mind,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
and our minds are in the universe.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
And we are expressions

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
of the universe, basically.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
As humans,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
ultimately being part of the universe,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
we're kind of the spokespeople

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
or the observer part

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
of the constituency

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
of the universe.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
And to interface with it,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
with a device that lets these forces

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
that are everywhere

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
act and show what they can do,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
giving them pigment and paint just like an artist,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
it's a good ally.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
It's a terrific studio assistant.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
JH: Well, I love the idea

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
that somewhere within this idea

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
of fine motion and control

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
with the traditional skills

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
that you have with your hand,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
some sort of more elemental force gets revealed,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
and that's the beauty here.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Tom, thank you so much. It's been really, really great.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
TS: Thank you, John.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
(Applause)
