00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I am going to speak about corruption,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
but I would like to juxtapose

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
two different things.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
One is the large global economy,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
the large globalized economy,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and the other one is the small, and very limited,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
capacity of our traditional governments

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and their international institutions

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
to govern, to shape, this economy.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Because there is this asymmetry,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
which creates, basically,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
failing governance.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Failing governance in many areas:

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
in the area of corruption and the area of destruction of the environment,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
in the area of exploitation of women and children,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
in the area of climate change,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
in all the areas in which we really need

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
a capacity to reintroduce

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
the primacy of politics

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
into the economy,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
which is operating in a worldwide arena.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And I think corruption,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and the fight against corruption,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and the impact of corruption,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
is probably one of the most interesting ways

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
to illustrate what I mean

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
with this failure of governance.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Let me talk about my own experience.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I used to work as the director

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
of the World Bank office in Nairobi

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
for East Africa.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
At that time, I noticed

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
that corruption, that grand corruption,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
that systematic corruption,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
was undermining everything we were trying to do.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And therefore, I began

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
to not only try to protect

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
the work of the World Bank,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
our own projects, our own programs

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
against corruption,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
but in general, I thought, "We need a system

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
to protect the people

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
in this part of the world

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
from the ravages of corruption."

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And as soon as I started this work,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I received a memorandum from the World Bank,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
from the legal department first,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
in which they said, "You are not allowed to do this.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
You are meddling in the internal affairs of our partner countries.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
This is forbidden by the charter of the World Bank,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
so I want you to stop your doings."

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
In the meantime, I was chairing

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
donor meetings, for instance,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
in which the various donors,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
and many of them like to be in Nairobi --

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
it is true, it is one of the

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
unsafest cities of the world,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
but they like to be there because the other cities

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
are even less comfortable.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And in these donor meetings, I noticed

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
that many of the worst projects --

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
which were put forward

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
by our clients, by the governments,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
by promoters,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
many of them representing

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
suppliers from the North --

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
that the worst projects

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
were realized first.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Let me give you an example:

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
a huge power project,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
300 million dollars,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
to be built smack into

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
one of the most vulnerable, and one of the most beautiful,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
areas of western Kenya.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
And we all noticed immediately

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
that this project had no economic benefits:

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
It had no clients, nobody would buy the electricity there,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
nobody was interested in irrigation projects.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
To the contrary, we knew that this project

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
would destroy the environment:

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
It would destroy riparian forests,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
which were the basis for

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
the survival of nomadic groups,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
the Samburu and the Turkana in this area.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
So everybody knew this is a, not a useless project,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
this is an absolute damaging, a terrible project --

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
not to speak about the future indebtedness of the country

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
for these hundreds of millions of dollars,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
and the siphoning off

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
of the scarce resources of the economy

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
from much more important activities

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
like schools, like hospitals and so on.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
And yet, we all rejected this project,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
none of the donors was willing

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
to have their name connected with it,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
and it was the first project to be implemented.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
The good projects, which we as a donor community

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
would take under our wings,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
they took years, you know,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
you had too many studies,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
and very often they didn't succeed.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
But these bad projects,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
which were absolutely damaging -- for the economy

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
for many generations, for the environment,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
for thousands of families who had to be resettled --

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
they were suddenly put together

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
by consortia of banks,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
of supplier agencies,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
of insurance agencies --

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
like in Germany, Hermes, and so on --

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
and they came back very, very quickly,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
driven by an unholy alliance

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
between the powerful elites

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
in the countries there

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
and the suppliers from the North.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Now, these suppliers

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
were our big companies.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
They were the actors of this global market,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
which I mentioned in the beginning.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
They were the Siemenses of this world,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
coming from France, from the UK, from Japan,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
from Canada, from Germany,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
and they were systematically driven

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
by systematic, large-scale corruption.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
We are not talking about

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
50,000 dollars here,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
or 100,000 dollars there, or one million dollars there.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
No, we are talking about 10 million, 20 million dollars

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
on the Swiss bank accounts,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
on the bank accounts of Liechtenstein,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
of the president's ministers,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
the high officials in the para-statal sectors.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
This was the reality which I saw,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
and not only one project like that:

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
I saw, I would say,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
over the years I worked in Africa,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
I saw hundreds of projects like this.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
And so, I became convinced

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
that it is this systematic corruption

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
which is perverting economic policy-making in these countries,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
which is the main reason

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
for the misery, for the poverty,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
for the conflicts, for the violence,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
for the desperation

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
in many of these countries.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
That we have today

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
more than a billion people below the absolute poverty line,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
that we have more than a billion people

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
without proper drinking water in the world,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
twice that number,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
more than two billion people

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
without sanitation and so on,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
and the consequent illnesses

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
of mothers and children,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
still, child mortality of more than

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
10 million people every year,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
children dying before they are five years old:

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
The cause of this is, to a large extent,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
grand corruption.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Now, why did the World Bank

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
not let me do this work?

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
I found out afterwards,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
after I left, under a big fight, the World Bank.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
The reason was that the members of the World Bank

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
thought that foreign bribery was okay,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
including Germany.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
In Germany, foreign bribery was allowed.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
It was even tax-deductible.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
No wonder that most of the most important

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
international operators in Germany,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
but also in France and the UK

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
and Scandinavia, everywhere, systematically bribed.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Not all of them, but most of them.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
And this is the phenomenon

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
which I call failing governance,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
because when I then came to Germany

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
and started this little NGO

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
here in Berlin, at the Villa Borsig,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
we were told, "You cannot stop

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
our German exporters from bribing,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
because we will lose our contracts.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
We will lose to the French,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
we will lose to the Swedes, we'll lose to the Japanese."

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
And therefore, there was a indeed a prisoner's dilemma,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
which made it very difficult

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
for an individual company,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
an individual exporting country

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
to say, "We are not going to

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
continue this deadly, disastrous

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
habit of large companies to bribe."

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
So this is what I mean

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
with a failing governance structure,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
because even the powerful government,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
which we have in Germany, comparatively,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
was not able to say,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
"We will not allow our companies to bribe abroad."

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
They needed help,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
and the large companies themselves

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
have this dilemma.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Many of them didn't want to bribe.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Many of the German companies, for instance,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
believe that they are really

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
producing a high-quality product

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
at a good price, so they are very competitive.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
They are not as good at bribing

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
as many of their international competitors are,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
but they were not allowed

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
to show their strengths,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
because the world was eaten up

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
by grand corruption.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And this is why I'm telling you this:

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Civil society rose to the occasion.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
We had this small NGO,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Transparency International.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
They began to think of

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
an escape route from this prisoner's dilemma,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
and we developed concepts

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
of collective action,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
basically trying to bring various competitors

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
together around the table,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
explaining to all of them

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
how much it would be in their interests

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
if they simultaneously would stop bribing,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
and to make a long story short,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
we managed to eventually

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
get Germany to sign

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
together with the other OECD countries

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
and a few other exporters.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
In 1997, a convention,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
under the auspices of the OECD,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
which obliged everybody

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
to change their laws

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
and criminalize foreign bribery.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
(Applause)

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Well, thank you. I mean, it's interesting,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
in doing this,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
we had to sit together with the companies.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
We had here in Berlin, at the Aspen Institute on the Wannsee,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
we had sessions with about

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
20 captains of industry,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
and we discussed with them

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
what to do about international bribery.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
In the first session -- we had three sessions

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
over the course of two years.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
And President von Weizsäcker, by the way,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
chaired one of the sessions, the first one,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
to take the fear away

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
from the entrepreneurs,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
who were not used to deal

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
with non-governmental organizations.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
And in the first session, they all said,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
"This is not bribery, what we are doing." This is customary there.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
This is what these other cultures demand.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
They even applaud it.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
In fact, [unclear]

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
still says this today.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
And so there are still a lot of people

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
who are not convinced that you have to stop bribing.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
But in the second session,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
they admitted already that they would never do this,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
what they are doing in these other countries,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
here in Germany, or in the U.K., and so on.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Cabinet ministers would admit this.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
And in the final session, at the Aspen Institute,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
we had them all sign an open letter

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
to the Kohl government, at the time,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
requesting that they

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
participate in the OECD convention.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
And this is, in my opinion,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
an example of soft power,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
because we were able to convince them

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
that they had to go with us.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
We had a longer-term time perspective.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
We had a broader,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
geographically much wider,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
constituency we were trying to defend.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
And that's why the law has changed.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
That's why Siemens is now in the trouble they are in

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
and that's why MIN is in the trouble they are in.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
In some other countries, the OECD convention

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
is not yet properly enforced.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
And, again, civil societies

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
breathing down the neck of the establishment.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
In London, for instance,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
where the BAE got away

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
with a huge corruption case,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
which the Serious Fraud Office tried to prosecute,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
100 million British pounds,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
every year for ten years,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
to one particular official of one particular friendly country,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
who then bought for

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
44 billion pounds of military equipment.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
This case, they are not prosecuting in the UK.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Why? Because they consider this

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
as contrary to the security interest

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
of the people of Great Britain.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Civil society is pushing, civil society

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
is trying to get a solution to this problem,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
also in the U.K.,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
and also in Japan, which is not properly enforcing,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
and so on.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
In Germany, we are pushing

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
the ratification of the UN convention,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
which is a subsequent convention.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
We are, Germany, is not ratifying.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Why? Because it would make it necessary

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
to criminalize the corruption

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
of deputies.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
In Germany, we have a system where

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
you are not allowed to bribe a civil servant,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
but you are allowed to bribe a deputy.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
This is, under German law, allowed,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
and the members of our parliament don't want to change this,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
and this is why they can't sign

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
the U.N. convention against foreign bribery --

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
one of they very, very few countries

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
which is preaching honesty and good governance everywhere in the world,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
but not able to ratify the convention,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
which we managed to get on the books

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
with about 160 countries all over the world.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
I see my time is ticking.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Let me just try to

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
draw some conclusions from what has happened.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
I believe that what we managed to achieve

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
in fighting corruption,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
one can also achieve

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
in other areas of failing governance.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
By now, the United Nations

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
is totally on our side.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
The World Bank has turned from Saulus to Paulus; under Wolfensohn,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
they became, I would say, the strongest

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
anti-corruption agency in the world.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Most of the large companies

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
are now totally convinced

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
that they have to put in place

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
very strong policies

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
against bribery and so on.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
And this is possible because civil society

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
joined the companies

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
and joined the government

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
in the analysis of the problem,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
in the development of remedies,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
in the implementation of reforms,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
and then later, in the monitoring of reforms.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Of course, if civil society organizations

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
want to play that role,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
they have to grow into this responsibility.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Not all civil society organizations are good.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
The Ku Klux Klan is an NGO.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
So, we must be aware

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
that civil society

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
has to shape up itself.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
They have to have a much more

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
transparent financial governance.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
They have to have a much more participatory governance

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
in many civil society organizations.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
We also need much more competence of civil society leaders.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
This is why we have set up the governance school

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
and the Center for Civil Society here in Berlin,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
because we believe most of our educational

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
and research institutions in Germany

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
and continental Europe in general,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
do not focus enough, yet,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
on empowering civil society

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
and training the leadership of civil society.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
But what I'm saying from my very practical experience:

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
If civil society does it right

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
and joins the other actors --

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
in particular, governments,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
governments and their international institutions,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
but also large international actors,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
in particular those which have committed themselves

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
to corporate social responsibility --

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
then in this magical triangle

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
between civil society,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
government and private sector,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
there is a tremendous chance

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
for all of us to create a better world.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Thank you.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
(Applause)
