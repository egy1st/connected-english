WEBVTT

00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.916
Sadly,

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.203
in the next 18 minutes when I do our chat,

00:00:06.227 --> 00:00:08.916
four Americans that are alive

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.988
will be dead through
the food that they eat.

00:00:14.631 --> 00:00:16.006
My name's Jamie Oliver.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.163
I'm 34 years old.

00:00:17.781 --> 00:00:19.916
I'm from Essex in England

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.916
and for the last seven years

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:28.298
I've worked fairly tirelessly
to save lives in my own way.

00:00:29.124 --> 00:00:30.916
I'm not a doctor;

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.117
I'm a chef,

00:00:32.141 --> 00:00:34.663
I don't have expensive equipment

00:00:34.687 --> 00:00:35.757
or medicine.

00:00:35.781 --> 00:00:38.026
I use information, education.

00:00:39.265 --> 00:00:42.242
I profoundly believe
that the power of food

00:00:42.266 --> 00:00:45.441
has a primal place in our homes

00:00:45.465 --> 00:00:49.916
that binds us to the best bits of life.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.230
We have an awful, awful reality right now.

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:01.495
America, you're at the top of your game.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.927
This is one of the most unhealthy
countries in the world.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.276
Can I please just see a raise of hands

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.879
for how many of you have
children in this room today?

00:01:10.903 --> 00:01:12.003
Put your hands up.

00:01:12.328 --> 00:01:15.713
You can continue to put your hands up,
aunties and uncles as well.

00:01:16.272 --> 00:01:18.249
Most of you. OK.

00:01:18.273 --> 00:01:21.250
We, the adults of the last
four generations,

00:01:21.274 --> 00:01:24.139
have blessed our children with the destiny

00:01:24.163 --> 00:01:28.495
of a shorter lifespan
than their own parents.

00:01:30.019 --> 00:01:34.916
Your child will live a life
ten years younger than you

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.916
because of the landscape of food
that we've built around them.

00:01:39.335 --> 00:01:40.820
Two-thirds of this room,

00:01:40.844 --> 00:01:43.820
today, in America, are statistically
overweight or obese.

00:01:44.174 --> 00:01:45.421
You lot, you're all right,

00:01:45.445 --> 00:01:47.460
but we'll get you eventually, don't worry.

00:01:47.484 --> 00:01:48.916
(Laughter)

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.916
The statistics of bad health are clear,

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.131
very clear.

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:57.373
We spend our lives being paranoid
about death, murder, homicide,

00:01:57.397 --> 00:02:00.916
you name it; it's on the front page
of every paper, CNN.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.433
Look at homicide
at the bottom, for God's sake.

00:02:04.338 --> 00:02:05.369
Right?

00:02:05.393 --> 00:02:06.916
(Laughter)

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.916
(Applause)

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.256
Every single one of those in the red
is a diet-related disease.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.868
Any doctor, any specialist
will tell you that.

00:02:18.892 --> 00:02:22.179
Fact: diet-related disease
is the biggest killer

00:02:22.203 --> 00:02:25.354
in the United States,
right now, here today.

00:02:28.045 --> 00:02:29.502
This is a global problem.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.662
It's a catastrophe.

00:02:31.686 --> 00:02:33.154
It's sweeping the world.

00:02:33.178 --> 00:02:35.391
England is right behind you, as usual.

00:02:36.153 --> 00:02:40.360
(Laughter)

00:02:40.384 --> 00:02:42.407
I know they were close,
but not that close.

00:02:43.106 --> 00:02:44.454
We need a revolution.

00:02:44.478 --> 00:02:46.757
Mexico, Australia, Germany,

00:02:46.781 --> 00:02:48.009
India, China,

00:02:48.033 --> 00:02:51.144
all have massive problems
of obesity and bad health.

00:02:52.725 --> 00:02:53.916
Think about smoking.

00:02:55.034 --> 00:02:56.916
It costs way less than obesity now.

00:02:57.677 --> 00:03:02.587
Obesity costs you Americans
10 percent of your health-care bills,

00:03:02.611 --> 00:03:05.332
150 billion dollars a year.

00:03:07.014 --> 00:03:08.916
In 10 years, it's set to double:

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.433
300 billion dollars a year.

00:03:10.457 --> 00:03:12.833
Let's be honest, guys,
you haven't got that cash.

00:03:12.857 --> 00:03:15.973
(Laughter)

00:03:16.765 --> 00:03:23.156
I came here to start a food revolution
that I so profoundly believe in.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.435
We need it. The time is now.

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.186
We're in a tipping-point moment.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:28.995
I've been doing this for seven years.

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.182
I've been trying in America
for seven years.

00:03:31.206 --> 00:03:35.090
Now is the time when it's ripe --
ripe for the picking.

00:03:35.114 --> 00:03:36.916
I went to the eye of the storm.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.869
I went to West Virginia,
the most unhealthy state in America.

00:03:39.893 --> 00:03:40.932
Or it was last year.

00:03:40.956 --> 00:03:44.195
We've got a new one this year,
but we'll work on that next season.

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:46.102
(Laughter)

00:03:46.126 --> 00:03:48.149
Huntington, West Virginia. Beautiful town.

00:03:48.173 --> 00:03:51.670
I wanted to put heart and soul and people,

00:03:51.694 --> 00:03:53.449
your public,

00:03:53.473 --> 00:03:56.964
around the statistics
that we've become so used to.

00:03:57.344 --> 00:04:00.344
I want to introduce you
to some of the people that I care about:

00:04:00.368 --> 00:04:01.988
your public, your children.

00:04:02.012 --> 00:04:04.561
I want to show a picture
of my friend Brittany.

00:04:04.585 --> 00:04:06.258
She's 16 years old.

00:04:06.868 --> 00:04:10.358
She's got six years to live

00:04:10.382 --> 00:04:12.916
because of the food that she's eaten.

00:04:13.224 --> 00:04:15.328
She's the third generation of Americans

00:04:15.352 --> 00:04:17.543
that hasn't grown up
within a food environment

00:04:17.567 --> 00:04:20.156
where they've been taught
to cook at home or in school,

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.187
or her mom, or her mom's mom.

00:04:22.211 --> 00:04:24.393
She has six years to live.

00:04:25.527 --> 00:04:27.701
She's eating her liver to death.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:29.836
Stacy, the Edwards family.

00:04:30.353 --> 00:04:32.201
This is a normal family, guys.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.766
Stacy does her best,
but she's third-generation as well;

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.139
she was never taught to cook
at home or at school.

00:04:38.163 --> 00:04:39.298
The family's obese.

00:04:39.322 --> 00:04:42.043
Justin here, 12 years old,
he's 350 pounds.

00:04:42.067 --> 00:04:43.735
He gets bullied, for God's sake.

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:46.226
The daughter there, Katie,
she's four years old.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.758
She's obese before she even gets
to primary school.

00:04:49.274 --> 00:04:51.916
Marissa, she's all right,
she's one of your lot.

00:04:52.222 --> 00:04:53.245
But you know what?

00:04:53.269 --> 00:04:56.627
Her father, who was obese,
died in her arms,

00:04:56.651 --> 00:04:59.055
And then the second
most important man in her life,

00:04:59.079 --> 00:05:01.603
her uncle, died of obesity,

00:05:01.627 --> 00:05:03.532
and now her step-dad is obese.

00:05:04.717 --> 00:05:06.493
You see, the thing is,

00:05:06.517 --> 00:05:08.916
obesity and diet-related disease

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.940
doesn't just hurt the people that have it;

00:05:10.964 --> 00:05:13.589
it's all of their friends, families,
brothers, sisters.

00:05:15.153 --> 00:05:16.916
Pastor Steve:

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:18.377
an inspirational man,

00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:20.915
one of my early allies
in Huntington, West Virginia.

00:05:21.271 --> 00:05:24.723
He's at the sharp knife-edge
of this problem.

00:05:25.215 --> 00:05:27.199
He has to bury the people, OK?

00:05:27.572 --> 00:05:28.752
And he's fed up with it.

00:05:28.776 --> 00:05:31.818
He's fed up with burying his friends,
his family, his community.

00:05:32.127 --> 00:05:35.075
Come winter, three times
as many people die.

00:05:35.456 --> 00:05:36.511
He's sick of it.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.606
This is preventable disease.
Waste of life.

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.019
By the way, this is
what they get buried in.

00:05:43.265 --> 00:05:44.948
We're not geared up to do this.

00:05:46.043 --> 00:05:48.671
Can't even get them out the door,
and I'm being serious.

00:05:48.695 --> 00:05:50.416
Can't even get them there. Forklift.

00:05:51.472 --> 00:05:53.564
OK, I see it as a triangle, OK?

00:05:53.588 --> 00:05:55.120
This is our landscape of food.

00:05:55.144 --> 00:05:56.501
I need you to understand it.

00:05:56.525 --> 00:05:58.589
You've probably heard all this before.

00:05:58.613 --> 00:05:59.899
Over the last 30 years,

00:05:59.923 --> 00:06:02.756
what's happened that's ripped
the heart out of this country?

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.021
Let's be frank and honest.

00:06:05.464 --> 00:06:07.664
Well, modern-day life.

00:06:07.688 --> 00:06:09.313
Let's start with the Main Street.

00:06:10.067 --> 00:06:12.751
Fast food has taken over
the whole country; we know that.

00:06:12.775 --> 00:06:15.579
The big brands are
some of the most important powers,

00:06:15.603 --> 00:06:17.443
powerful powers, in this country.

00:06:18.053 --> 00:06:19.054
(Sighs)

00:06:19.078 --> 00:06:20.377
Supermarkets as well.

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:22.796
Big companies. Big companies.

00:06:23.211 --> 00:06:26.171
Thirty years ago, most of the food

00:06:26.195 --> 00:06:28.916
was largely local and largely fresh.

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.299
Now it's largely processed
and full of all sorts of additives,

00:06:32.323 --> 00:06:35.014
extra ingredients,
and you know the rest of the story.

00:06:35.038 --> 00:06:37.916
Portion size is obviously
a massive, massive problem.

00:06:39.617 --> 00:06:41.456
Labeling is a massive problem.

00:06:42.273 --> 00:06:44.440
The labeling in this country
is a disgrace.

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:49.885
The industry wants
to self-police themselves.

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.495
What, in this kind of climate?
They don't deserve it.

00:06:53.519 --> 00:06:56.785
How can you say something is low-fat
when it's full of so much sugar?

00:06:58.011 --> 00:06:59.031
Home.

00:07:01.213 --> 00:07:02.788
The biggest problem with the home

00:07:02.812 --> 00:07:07.916
is that used to be the heart
of passing on food culture,

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.364
what made our society.

00:07:10.388 --> 00:07:11.821
That is not happening anymore.

00:07:11.845 --> 00:07:14.726
And you know, as we go
to work and as life changes,

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:16.727
and as life always evolves,

00:07:16.751 --> 00:07:18.864
we kind of have
to look at it holistically --

00:07:18.888 --> 00:07:21.276
step back for a moment,
and re-address the balance.

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.363
It hasn't happened for 30 years, OK?

00:07:24.344 --> 00:07:27.702
I want to show you a situation

00:07:27.726 --> 00:07:30.967
that is very normal right now;
the Edwards family.

00:07:31.582 --> 00:07:33.558
(Video) Jamie Oliver: Let's have a talk.

00:07:34.412 --> 00:07:38.445
This stuff goes through you
and your family's body every week.

00:07:38.469 --> 00:07:40.378
And I need you to know

00:07:40.402 --> 00:07:43.972
that this is going to kill
your children early.

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:45.940
How are you feeling?

00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:49.916
Stacy: Just feeling really sad
and depressed right now.

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.743
But, you know, I want
my kids to succeed in life

00:07:53.767 --> 00:07:55.916
and this isn't going to get them there.

00:07:56.749 --> 00:07:58.245
But I'm killing them.

00:07:59.655 --> 00:08:02.631
JO: Yes you are. You are.

00:08:02.655 --> 00:08:03.867
But we can stop that.

00:08:07.757 --> 00:08:08.831
Normal.

00:08:10.006 --> 00:08:11.840
Let's get on schools,

00:08:11.864 --> 00:08:14.916
something that I'm fairly much
a specialist in.

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:16.477
OK, school.

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:19.916
What is school? Who invented it?
What's the purpose of school?

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:22.772
School was always invented
to arm us with the tools

00:08:22.796 --> 00:08:25.615
to make us creative, do wonderful things,

00:08:25.639 --> 00:08:28.096
make us earn a living, etc., etc.

00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:32.278
You know, it's been kind of in this sort
of tight box for a long, long time, OK?

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:34.916
But we haven't really evolved it

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:38.270
to deal with the health
catastrophes of America, OK?

00:08:38.294 --> 00:08:41.381
School food is something

00:08:41.405 --> 00:08:44.063
that most kids --
31 million a day, actually --

00:08:44.087 --> 00:08:48.748
have twice a day, more than often,
breakfast and lunch,

00:08:48.772 --> 00:08:50.501
180 days of the year.

00:08:50.525 --> 00:08:53.700
So you could say that school
food is quite important, really,

00:08:53.724 --> 00:08:55.310
judging the circumstances.

00:08:55.334 --> 00:08:59.350
(Laughter)

00:09:00.399 --> 00:09:02.916
Before I crack into my rant,

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:04.966
which I'm sure you're waiting for --

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:08.037
(Laughter)

00:09:08.061 --> 00:09:10.427
I need to say one thing,
and it's so important

00:09:10.451 --> 00:09:13.158
in, hopefully, the magic
that happens and unfolds

00:09:13.182 --> 00:09:14.395
in the next three months.

00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:18.229
The lunch ladies,
the lunch cooks of America --

00:09:18.253 --> 00:09:21.628
I offer myself as their ambassador.

00:09:21.652 --> 00:09:23.138
I'm not slagging them off.

00:09:23.162 --> 00:09:25.162
They're doing the best they can do.

00:09:27.828 --> 00:09:29.240
They're doing their best.

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:31.772
But they're doing what they're told,

00:09:31.796 --> 00:09:34.057
and what they're being
told to do is wrong.

00:09:34.376 --> 00:09:37.613
The system is highly run by accountants;

00:09:37.637 --> 00:09:41.714
there's not enough, or any,
food-knowledgeable people in the business.

00:09:41.738 --> 00:09:42.769
There's a problem:

00:09:42.793 --> 00:09:45.916
If you're not a food expert,
and you've got tight budgets

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:48.650
and it's getting tighter,
then you can't be creative,

00:09:48.674 --> 00:09:51.813
you can't duck and dive
and write different things around things.

00:09:51.837 --> 00:09:53.844
If you're an accountant, and a box-ticker,

00:09:53.868 --> 00:09:56.114
the only thing you can do
in these circumstances

00:09:56.138 --> 00:09:57.166
is buy cheaper shit.

00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:58.520
Now, the reality is,

00:09:58.544 --> 00:10:02.155
the food that your kids get
every day is fast food,

00:10:02.179 --> 00:10:03.488
it's highly processed,

00:10:03.512 --> 00:10:05.752
there's not enough
fresh food in there at all.

00:10:05.776 --> 00:10:07.957
You know, the amount
of additives, E numbers,

00:10:07.981 --> 00:10:09.687
ingredients you wouldn't believe --

00:10:09.711 --> 00:10:11.422
there's not enough veggies at all.

00:10:11.446 --> 00:10:13.370
French fries are considered a vegetable.

00:10:13.394 --> 00:10:15.916
Pizza for breakfast.
They don't even get crockery.

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:18.272
Knives and forks?
No, they're too dangerous.

00:10:19.097 --> 00:10:20.837
They have scissors in the classroom,

00:10:20.861 --> 00:10:22.242
but knives and forks? No.

00:10:22.266 --> 00:10:23.662
And the way I look at it is:

00:10:23.686 --> 00:10:26.075
If you don't have knives
and forks in your school,

00:10:26.099 --> 00:10:27.638
you're purely endorsing,

00:10:27.662 --> 00:10:30.734
from a state level, fast food,
because it's handheld.

00:10:30.758 --> 00:10:32.543
And yes, by the way, it is fast food:

00:10:32.567 --> 00:10:34.157
It's sloppy Joes, it's burgers,

00:10:34.181 --> 00:10:36.957
it's wieners, it's pizzas,
it's all of that stuff.

00:10:38.205 --> 00:10:39.644
(Sighs)

00:10:40.392 --> 00:10:43.369
Ten percent of what we spend
on health care, as I said earlier,

00:10:43.393 --> 00:10:45.828
is on obesity, and it's going to double.

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:48.520
We're not teaching our kids.

00:10:48.544 --> 00:10:51.249
There's no statutory right
to teach kids about food,

00:10:51.273 --> 00:10:53.066
elementary or secondary school, OK?

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:55.408
We don't teach kids about food, right?

00:10:55.432 --> 00:10:57.861
And this is a little clip
from an elementary school,

00:10:57.885 --> 00:10:59.464
which is very common in England.

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:03.469
(Video) Who knows what this is?

00:11:03.493 --> 00:11:04.564
Child: Potatoes.

00:11:04.588 --> 00:11:07.176
Jamie Oliver: Potato?
So, you think these are potatoes?

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.421
Do you know what that is?

00:11:08.734 --> 00:11:09.938
Do you know what that is?

00:11:09.962 --> 00:11:10.977
Child: Broccoli?

00:11:11.001 --> 00:11:13.457
JO: What about this? Our good old friend.

00:11:13.481 --> 00:11:14.641
Child: Celery.

00:11:14.665 --> 00:11:16.609
JO: No. What do you think this is?

00:11:16.633 --> 00:11:18.117
Child: Onion.
JO: Onion? No.

00:11:18.141 --> 00:11:20.547
JO: Immediately you
get a really clear sense

00:11:20.571 --> 00:11:23.791
of "Do the kids know anything
about where food comes from?"

00:11:23.815 --> 00:11:25.792
Who knows what that is? Child: Uh, pear?

00:11:25.816 --> 00:11:28.244
JO: What do you think this is?
Child: I don't know.

00:11:28.268 --> 00:11:30.252
JO: If the kids don't know what stuff is,

00:11:30.276 --> 00:11:31.675
then they will never eat it.

00:11:33.863 --> 00:11:35.120
(Laughter)

00:11:35.144 --> 00:11:37.916
JO: Normal. England and America,

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:39.478
England and America.

00:11:39.502 --> 00:11:41.645
Guess what fixed that.

00:11:42.107 --> 00:11:43.580
Two one-hour sessions.

00:11:45.151 --> 00:11:48.540
We've got to start teaching our kids
about food in schools, period.

00:11:49.376 --> 00:11:54.916
(Applause)

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:58.961
I want to tell you about something

00:11:58.985 --> 00:12:03.323
that kind of epitomizes the trouble
that we're in, guys, OK?

00:12:03.347 --> 00:12:05.918
I want to talk about something
so basic as milk.

00:12:06.582 --> 00:12:08.583
Every kid has the right to milk at school.

00:12:08.607 --> 00:12:12.203
Your kids will be having milk
at school, breakfast and lunch, right?

00:12:12.227 --> 00:12:14.025
They'll be having two bottles, OK?

00:12:14.049 --> 00:12:15.542
And most kids do.

00:12:15.566 --> 00:12:18.351
But milk ain't good enough anymore.

00:12:18.375 --> 00:12:20.916
Don't get me wrong, I support milk --

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:23.056
but someone at the milk board

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.750
probably paid a lot of money
for some geezer to work out

00:12:25.774 --> 00:12:27.515
that if you put loads of flavorings,

00:12:27.539 --> 00:12:28.962
colorings and sugar in milk,

00:12:28.986 --> 00:12:30.404
more kids will drink it.

00:12:31.645 --> 00:12:32.645
Yeah.

00:12:33.161 --> 00:12:35.114
Obviously now that's going to catch on

00:12:35.138 --> 00:12:36.924
the apple board is going to work out

00:12:36.948 --> 00:12:39.725
that if they make toffee apples
they'll eat more as well.

00:12:39.749 --> 00:12:41.162
Do you know what I mean?

00:12:41.186 --> 00:12:44.233
For me, there isn't any need
to flavor the milk.

00:12:44.257 --> 00:12:46.280
Okay? There's sugar in everything.

00:12:46.304 --> 00:12:48.453
I know the ins and outs
of those ingredients.

00:12:48.477 --> 00:12:49.503
It's in everything.

00:12:49.527 --> 00:12:53.105
Even the milk hasn't escaped
the kind of modern-day problems.

00:12:53.129 --> 00:12:54.916
There's our milk. There's our carton.

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:59.189
In that is nearly as much sugar
as one of your favorite cans of fizzy pop,

00:12:59.213 --> 00:13:00.649
and they are having two a day.

00:13:00.673 --> 00:13:02.228
So, let me just show you.

00:13:02.252 --> 00:13:05.334
We've got one kid, here --

00:13:07.027 --> 00:13:10.839
having, you know,
eight tablespoons of sugar a day.

00:13:11.559 --> 00:13:13.685
You know, there's your week.

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.296
There's your month.

00:13:17.518 --> 00:13:19.713
And I've taken the liberty of putting in

00:13:19.737 --> 00:13:22.737
just the five years
of elementary school sugar,

00:13:26.393 --> 00:13:27.591
just from milk.

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:32.760
Now, I don't know about you guys,

00:13:32.784 --> 00:13:35.601
but judging the circumstances, right,

00:13:35.625 --> 00:13:37.916
any judge in the whole world,

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:40.404
would look at the statistics
and the evidence,

00:13:40.428 --> 00:13:43.713
and they would find any government
of old guilty of child abuse.

00:13:44.268 --> 00:13:45.372
That's my belief.

00:13:45.396 --> 00:13:48.396
(Applause)

00:13:52.287 --> 00:13:53.916
(Applause ends)

00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:57.232
Now, if I came up here, and I wish
I could come up here today

00:13:57.256 --> 00:13:59.917
and hang a cure for AIDS or cancer,

00:13:59.941 --> 00:14:02.391
you'd be fighting
and scrambling to get to me.

00:14:03.424 --> 00:14:06.400
This, all this bad news, is preventable.

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:08.451
That's the good news.

00:14:08.475 --> 00:14:10.451
It's very, very preventable.

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:13.916
So, let's just think about,
we got a problem here,

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:15.058
we need to reboot.

00:14:16.273 --> 00:14:18.916
Okay so, in my world,
what do we need to do?

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:20.655
Here is the thing, right,

00:14:20.679 --> 00:14:22.916
it cannot just come from one source.

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:26.347
To reboot and make real tangible change,

00:14:26.371 --> 00:14:29.315
real change, so that I could look you
in the white of the eyes

00:14:29.339 --> 00:14:30.916
and say, "In 10 years' time,

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:32.916
the history of your children's lives,

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:35.988
happiness -- and let's not forget,
you're clever if you eat well,

00:14:36.012 --> 00:14:37.870
you know you're going to live longer --

00:14:37.894 --> 00:14:40.827
all of that stuff,
it will look different. OK?"

00:14:41.546 --> 00:14:43.252
So, supermarkets.

00:14:43.276 --> 00:14:45.196
Where else do you shop so religiously?

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:46.408
Week in, week out.

00:14:46.432 --> 00:14:49.511
How much money do you spend,
in your life, in a supermarket?

00:14:49.535 --> 00:14:50.543
Love them.

00:14:50.567 --> 00:14:52.623
They just sell us what we want. All right.

00:14:52.647 --> 00:14:57.106
They owe us to put a food ambassador
in every major supermarket.

00:14:57.622 --> 00:14:59.202
They need to help us shop.

00:14:59.226 --> 00:15:02.916
They need to show us how to cook
quick, tasty, seasonal meals

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:04.805
for people that are busy.

00:15:04.829 --> 00:15:06.798
This is not expensive.

00:15:06.822 --> 00:15:09.703
It is done in some, and it needs
to be done across the board

00:15:09.727 --> 00:15:11.432
in America soon, and quick.

00:15:11.804 --> 00:15:14.781
The big brands, you know, the food brands,

00:15:14.805 --> 00:15:18.530
need to put food education
at the heart of their businesses.

00:15:18.554 --> 00:15:20.434
I know, easier said than done.

00:15:20.458 --> 00:15:22.669
It's the future. It's the only way.

00:15:22.693 --> 00:15:24.314
Fast food.

00:15:24.338 --> 00:15:27.098
With the fast-food industry

00:15:27.122 --> 00:15:28.916
you know, it's very competitive.

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:31.035
I've had loads
of secret papers and dealings

00:15:31.059 --> 00:15:32.777
with fast food restaurants.

00:15:32.801 --> 00:15:34.618
I know how they do it.

00:15:34.642 --> 00:15:36.915
I mean, basically they've weaned us on

00:15:36.939 --> 00:15:39.718
to these hits of sugar,
salt and fat, and x, y, and z,

00:15:39.742 --> 00:15:41.719
and everyone loves them, right?

00:15:41.743 --> 00:15:44.939
So, these guys are going
to be part of the solution.

00:15:44.963 --> 00:15:46.916
But we need to get the government to work

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:49.988
with all of the fast food purveyors
and the restaurant industry,

00:15:50.012 --> 00:15:52.061
and over a five, six, seven year period

00:15:52.085 --> 00:15:54.404
wean of us off the extreme amounts

00:15:54.428 --> 00:15:57.916
of fat, sugar and all the other
non-food ingredients.

00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:00.222
Now, also, back to the sort of big brands:

00:16:00.246 --> 00:16:03.428
labeling, I said earlier,
is an absolute farce

00:16:03.452 --> 00:16:04.863
and has got to be sorted.

00:16:06.243 --> 00:16:07.568
OK, school.

00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:10.916
Obviously, in schools, we owe it to them

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:12.916
to make sure those 180 days of the year,

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:14.916
from that little precious age of four,

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:16.916
until 18, 20, 24, whatever,

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:21.791
they need to be cooked proper, fresh food

00:16:21.815 --> 00:16:23.916
from local growers on site, OK?

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:26.466
There needs to be a new
standard of fresh, proper food

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:27.916
for your children, yeah?

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:32.369
(Applause)

00:16:32.393 --> 00:16:35.829
Under the circumstances,
it's profoundly important

00:16:35.853 --> 00:16:38.422
that every single
American child leaves school

00:16:38.446 --> 00:16:40.423
knowing how to cook 10 recipes

00:16:40.447 --> 00:16:41.796
that will save their life.

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:44.019
Life skills.

00:16:44.043 --> 00:16:46.240
(Applause)

00:16:46.264 --> 00:16:49.302
That means that they can be
students, young parents,

00:16:49.326 --> 00:16:53.565
and be able to sort of duck and dive
around the basics of cooking,

00:16:53.589 --> 00:16:55.692
no matter what recession hits
them next time.

00:16:55.716 --> 00:16:58.098
If you can cook,
recession money doesn't matter.

00:16:58.122 --> 00:17:00.593
If you can cook, time doesn't matter.

00:17:02.135 --> 00:17:04.580
The workplace, we haven't
really talked about it.

00:17:04.604 --> 00:17:08.166
You know, it's now time
for corporate responsibility

00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:12.214
to really look at what they feed
or make available to their staff.

00:17:12.238 --> 00:17:15.548
The staff are the moms and dads
of America's children.

00:17:15.572 --> 00:17:17.731
Marissa, her father died in her hand,

00:17:17.755 --> 00:17:19.732
I think she'd be quite happy

00:17:19.756 --> 00:17:22.916
if corporate America could start
feeding their staff properly.

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:24.916
Definitely they shouldn't be left out.

00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:26.506
Let's go back to the home.

00:17:26.530 --> 00:17:28.770
Now, look, if we do
all this stuff, and we can,

00:17:28.794 --> 00:17:29.867
it's so achievable.

00:17:29.891 --> 00:17:31.633
You can care and be commercial.

00:17:31.657 --> 00:17:32.680
Absolutely.

00:17:32.704 --> 00:17:37.699
But the home needs to start passing on
cooking again, for sure.

00:17:37.723 --> 00:17:39.699
For sure, pass it on as a philosophy.

00:17:40.213 --> 00:17:41.857
And for me, it's quite romantic,

00:17:41.881 --> 00:17:44.274
but it's about if one person
teaches three people

00:17:44.298 --> 00:17:45.916
how to cook something,

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.680
and they teach three of their mates,

00:17:47.704 --> 00:17:50.028
that only has to repeat itself 25 times,

00:17:50.052 --> 00:17:52.307
and that's the whole
population of America.

00:17:52.331 --> 00:17:56.631
Romantic, yes, but most importantly,

00:17:56.655 --> 00:17:59.346
it's about trying to get people to realize

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:02.354
that every one of your individual efforts
makes a difference.

00:18:02.378 --> 00:18:04.578
We've got to put back what's been lost.

00:18:05.072 --> 00:18:06.294
Huntington's Kitchen.

00:18:06.935 --> 00:18:09.206
Huntington, where I made this program,

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:10.817
we've got this prime-time program

00:18:10.841 --> 00:18:14.029
that hopefully will inspire people
to really get on this change.

00:18:14.053 --> 00:18:16.084
I truly believe that change will happen.

00:18:16.108 --> 00:18:18.275
Huntington's Kitchen.
I work with a community.

00:18:18.299 --> 00:18:19.780
I worked in the schools.

00:18:19.804 --> 00:18:22.069
I found local sustainable funding

00:18:22.093 --> 00:18:26.379
to get every single school in the area
from the junk, onto the fresh food:

00:18:26.403 --> 00:18:28.272
six-and-a-half grand per school.

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:30.146
(Applause)

00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:32.666
That's all it takes,
six-and-a-half grand per school.

00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:35.093
The Kitchen is 25 grand a month. Okay?

00:18:35.117 --> 00:18:37.992
This can do 5,000 people a year,

00:18:38.016 --> 00:18:40.134
which is 10 percent of their population,

00:18:40.158 --> 00:18:41.539
and it's people on people.

00:18:41.563 --> 00:18:43.864
You know, it's local cooks
teaching local people.

00:18:43.888 --> 00:18:47.474
It's free cooking lessons,
guys, in the Main Street.

00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:51.627
This is real, tangible change,
real, tangible change.

00:18:52.424 --> 00:18:55.446
Around America, if we just look back now,

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:57.873
there is plenty of wonderful
things going on.

00:18:58.574 --> 00:19:00.683
There is plenty of beautiful
things going on.

00:19:00.707 --> 00:19:03.916
There are angels
around America doing great things

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:06.837
in schools -- farm-to-school set-ups,

00:19:06.861 --> 00:19:09.472
garden set-ups, education --

00:19:09.496 --> 00:19:11.593
there are amazing people
doing this already.

00:19:11.617 --> 00:19:13.546
The problem is they all want to roll out

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:15.705
what they're doing to the next school,

00:19:15.729 --> 00:19:17.077
but there's no cash.

00:19:17.997 --> 00:19:21.697
We need to recognize the experts
and the angels quickly,

00:19:21.721 --> 00:19:24.916
identify them, and allow them
to easily find the resource

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:27.180
to keep rolling out
what they're already doing,

00:19:27.204 --> 00:19:28.204
and doing well.

00:19:28.788 --> 00:19:31.060
Businesses of America need to support

00:19:31.084 --> 00:19:33.916
Mrs. Obama to do the things
that she wants to do.

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:40.339
(Applause)

00:19:40.363 --> 00:19:42.309
And look, I know it's weird

00:19:42.333 --> 00:19:44.916
having an English person
standing here before you

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:46.381
talking about all this.

00:19:46.405 --> 00:19:47.753
All I can say is: I care.

00:19:48.309 --> 00:19:49.731
I'm a father,

00:19:49.755 --> 00:19:51.096
and I love this country.

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:54.542
And I believe truly, actually,

00:19:54.566 --> 00:19:57.415
that if change can be made
in this country,

00:19:57.439 --> 00:19:59.622
beautiful things will happen
around the world.

00:19:59.646 --> 00:20:01.781
If America does it,
other people will follow.

00:20:01.805 --> 00:20:03.201
It's incredibly important.

00:20:03.577 --> 00:20:04.645
(Audience) Yeah!

00:20:04.669 --> 00:20:10.300
(Applause)

00:20:10.324 --> 00:20:11.602
When I was in Huntington,

00:20:11.626 --> 00:20:14.250
trying to get a few things to work
when they weren't,

00:20:14.274 --> 00:20:19.585
I thought "If I had a magic wand,
what would I do?"

00:20:19.609 --> 00:20:21.166
And I thought, "You know what?

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:24.473
I'd just love to be put in front
of some of the most amazing

00:20:24.497 --> 00:20:26.261
movers and shakers in America."

00:20:27.181 --> 00:20:30.268
And a month later, TED phoned me up
and gave me this award.

00:20:31.733 --> 00:20:32.788
I'm here.

00:20:35.455 --> 00:20:36.637
So, my wish.

00:20:41.675 --> 00:20:43.437
Dyslexic, so I'm a bit slow.

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:50.916
My wish

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:55.071
is for you to help a strong,
sustainable movement

00:20:55.095 --> 00:20:58.769
to educate every child

00:20:58.793 --> 00:21:01.181
about food,

00:21:01.205 --> 00:21:04.720
to inspire families to cook again,

00:21:04.744 --> 00:21:07.405
and to empower people everywhere

00:21:07.429 --> 00:21:08.952
to fight obesity.

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:13.044
(Applause)

00:21:20.183 --> 00:21:21.236
Thank you.

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:24.260
(Applause continues)
