00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
About a year and a half ago,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Stephen Lawler, who also gave a talk

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
here at TED in 2007 on Virtual Earth,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
brought me over to become the architect of Bing Maps,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
which is Microsoft's online-mapping effort.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
In the past two and a half, we've been very hard at work

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
on redefining the way maps work online.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And we really are seeing this in very different terms

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
from the kind of mapping and direction site

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
that one is used to.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So, the first thing that you might notice about the mapping site

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
is just the fluidity of the zooming and the panning,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
which, if you're familiar at all with Seadragon,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
that's where it comes from.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Mapping is, of course,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
not just about cartography,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
it's also about imagery.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So, as we zoom-in beyond a certain level

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
this resolves into a kind of Sim City-like

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
virtual view at 45 degrees.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
This can be viewed from any of the cardinal directions

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
to show you the 3D structure of the city, all the facades.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Now, we see this space, this three-dimensional environment,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
as being a canvas on which

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
all sorts of applications can play out,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and map's directions are really just one of them.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
If you click on this, you'll see

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
some of the ones that we've put out, just in the past couple of months

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
since we've launched.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
So, for example, a couple of days after the disaster in Haiti,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
we had an earthquake map that showed

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
before and after pictures from the sky.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
This wonderful one which I don't have time to show you

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
is taking hyper-local blogs in real time

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and mapping those stories, those entries

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
to the places that are referred to on the blogs.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
It's wonderful.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
But I'm going to show you some more candy sort of stuff.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
So, we see the imagery, of course,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
not stopping at the sky.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
These little green bubbles represent

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
photosynths that users have made.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I'm not going to dive into them either, but photosynths are integrated into the map.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Everything that's cased in blue

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
is an area where we've taken imagery on the ground as well.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And so, when you fly down --

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
(Applause)

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Thank you. When you fly down to the ground,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and you see this kind of panoramic imagery,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
the first thing that you might notice is that it's not just a picture,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
there's just as much three-dimensional understanding of this environment

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
as there is of the three-dimensional city from above,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
so if I click on something to get a closer view of it,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
then, the fact that that transition looks as it does,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
is a function of all of that geometry,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
all of that 3D understanding behind this model.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Now, I'll show you a fun app

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000
that -- we've been working on a collaboration with our friends at Flickr.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
This takes Flickr, georegistered imagery

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and uses photosynth-like processes

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
to connect that imagery to our imagery, so --

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
I'm not sure if that's the one I actually meant to pull up, but --

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
(Laughter)

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
But notice -- this is, of course, a popular tourist site,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and there are lots of photos around here,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and these photos are all taken at different times.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
So this one was taken around five.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
So that's the Flickr photo,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
that's our imagery.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
So you really see how this kind of crowd-sourced imagery

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
is integrating, in a very deep way, into the map itself.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
(Applause)

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Thank you.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
(Applause)

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
There are several reasons why this is interesting

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
and one of them, of course, is time travel.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And I'm not going to show you some of the wonderful historic imagery in here,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
but there are some with horses and carriages and so on as well.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
But what's cool about this is that, not only is it augmenting

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
this visual representation of the world

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
with things that are coming in from users,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
but it also is the foundation for augmented reality,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
and that's something that I'll be showing you more of in just a moment.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Now I just made a transition indoors. That's also interesting.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
OK, notice there's now a roof above us.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
We're inside the Pike Place Market.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And this is something that we're able to do with a backpack camera,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
so, we're now not only imaging in the street

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
with this camera on tops of cars,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
but we're also imaging inside.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And from here, we're able to do the same sorts of registration,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
not only of still images, but also of video.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
So this is something that we're now going to try

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
for the first time, live,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
and this is really, truly, very frightening.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
(Laughter)

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
OK.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
(Ringing)

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
All right, guys, are you there?

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
(Noise)

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
All right. I'm hitting it. I'm punching play.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
I'm live. All right. There we go.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
So, these are our friends in Pike Place Market, the lab.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:56.000
(Applause)

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
So they're broadcasting this live.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
OK, George, can you pan back over to the corner market?

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Because I want to show points of interest.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
No, no. The other way.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Yeah, yeah, back to the corner, back to the corner.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
I don't want to see you guys yet.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000
OK, OK, back to the corner, back to the corner, back to the corner.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
OK, never mind.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
What I wanted to show you was these points of interest

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
over here on top of the image

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
because what that gives you a sense of is the way,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
if you're actually on the spot,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
you can think about this --

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
this is taking a step in addition to augmented reality.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
What the hell are you guys -- oh, sorry.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
(Laughter)

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
We're doing two different --

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
OK, I'm hanging up now.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
We're doing two different things here.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
One of them is to take that real ...

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:00.000
(Laughter)

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
All right, let me just take a moment and thank the team.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
They've done a fantastic job of pulling this together.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
(Applause)

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
I'm going to abandon them now and walk back outside.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And while I walk outside, I'll just mention that

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
here we're using this for telepresence,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
but you can equally well use this

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
on the spot, for augmented reality.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
When you use it on the spot, it means that

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
you're able to bring all of that metadata

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
and information about the world to you.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
So here, we're taking the extra step of also broadcasting it.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
That was being broadcast, by the way, on a 4G network

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
from the market.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
All right, and now there's one last TED talk

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
that Microsoft has given in the past several years.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
And that's Curtis Wong, WorldWide Telescope.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
So, we're going to head over to the dumpsters,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
where it's traditional, after a long day at the market,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
to go out for a break, but also stare up at the sky.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
This is the integration

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
of WorldWide Telescope into our maps.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
(Applause)

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
This is the current -- thank you --

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
this is the current time. If we scrub the time,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
then we can see how the sky will look at different times,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
and we can get all of this very detailed

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
information about different times, different dates:

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Let's move the moon a little higher in the sky,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
maybe change the date.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
I would like to kind of zoom in on the moon.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
So, this is an astronomically complete

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
representation of the sky

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
integrated right into the Earth.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
All right now, I've overrun my time,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
so I've got to stop.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Thank you all very much.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:49.000
(Applause)
