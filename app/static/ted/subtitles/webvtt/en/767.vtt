00:00:00.754 --> 00:00:04.388
I'm going to talk today
about energy and climate.

00:00:05.103 --> 00:00:06.881
And that might seem a bit surprising,

00:00:06.905 --> 00:00:10.054
because my full-time work
at the foundation

00:00:10.078 --> 00:00:12.113
is mostly about vaccines and seeds,

00:00:12.137 --> 00:00:15.705
about the things that we need
to invent and deliver

00:00:15.729 --> 00:00:19.236
to help the poorest two billion
live better lives.

00:00:20.481 --> 00:00:24.976
But energy and climate
are extremely important to these people;

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.271
in fact, more important
than to anyone else on the planet.

00:00:29.793 --> 00:00:35.504
The climate getting worse means
that many years, their crops won't grow:

00:00:35.528 --> 00:00:38.559
there will be too much rain,
not enough rain;

00:00:38.583 --> 00:00:44.520
things will change in ways their fragile
environment simply can't support.

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:48.173
And that leads to starvation, it leads
to uncertainty, it leads to unrest.

00:00:48.872 --> 00:00:52.006
So, the climate changes
will be terrible for them.

00:00:52.833 --> 00:00:55.976
Also, the price of energy
is very important to them.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.278
In fact, if you could pick just one thing

00:00:58.302 --> 00:01:03.034
to lower the price of to reduce poverty,
by far you would pick energy.

00:01:03.702 --> 00:01:06.615
Now, the price of energy
has come down over time.

00:01:07.083 --> 00:01:13.389
Really advanced civilization
is based on advances in energy.

00:01:13.778 --> 00:01:17.349
The coal revolution fueled
the Industrial Revolution,

00:01:17.373 --> 00:01:21.434
and, even in the 1900s,
we've seen a very rapid decline

00:01:21.458 --> 00:01:22.976
in the price of electricity,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.382
and that's why we have
refrigerators, air-conditioning;

00:01:26.406 --> 00:01:29.718
we can make modern materials
and do so many things.

00:01:30.226 --> 00:01:36.379
And so, we're in a wonderful situation
with electricity in the rich world.

00:01:37.284 --> 00:01:40.163
But as we make it cheaper --
and let's say,

00:01:40.187 --> 00:01:42.896
let's go for making it twice as cheap --

00:01:44.356 --> 00:01:45.976
we need to meet a new constraint,

00:01:46.777 --> 00:01:50.719
and that constraint has to do with CO2.

00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:53.812
CO2 is warming the planet,

00:01:53.836 --> 00:01:58.976
and the equation on CO2
is actually a very straightforward one.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.939
If you sum up the CO2 that gets emitted,

00:02:03.606 --> 00:02:05.976
that leads to a temperature increase,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.976
and that temperature increase
leads to some very negative effects:

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.913
the effects on the weather;
perhaps worse, the indirect effects,

00:02:13.937 --> 00:02:18.630
in that the natural ecosystems
can't adjust to these rapid changes,

00:02:18.654 --> 00:02:20.897
and so you get ecosystem collapses.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.795
Now, the exact amount of how you map
from a certain increase of CO2

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.109
to what temperature will be,
and where the positive feedbacks are --

00:02:30.133 --> 00:02:32.853
there's some uncertainty there,
but not very much.

00:02:33.266 --> 00:02:36.566
And there's certainly uncertainty
about how bad those effects will be,

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.326
but they will be extremely bad.

00:02:39.201 --> 00:02:41.503
I asked the top scientists
on this several times:

00:02:41.527 --> 00:02:44.051
Do we really have to get
down to near zero?

00:02:44.075 --> 00:02:47.108
Can't we just cut it in half or a quarter?

00:02:47.132 --> 00:02:50.976
And the answer is,
until we get near to zero,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.976
the temperature will continue to rise.

00:02:53.458 --> 00:02:55.228
And so that's a big challenge.

00:02:55.252 --> 00:02:57.478
It's very different than saying,

00:02:57.502 --> 00:03:00.838
"We're a twelve-foot-high truck
trying to get under a ten-foot bridge,

00:03:00.862 --> 00:03:03.245
and we can just sort of squeeze under."

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:06.592
This is something that has to get to zero.

00:03:07.568 --> 00:03:10.837
Now, we put out a lot
of carbon dioxide every year --

00:03:10.861 --> 00:03:12.964
over 26 billion tons.

00:03:13.582 --> 00:03:16.746
For each American, it's about 20 tons.

00:03:17.178 --> 00:03:19.976
For people in poor countries,
it's less than one ton.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.660
It's an average of about five tons
for everyone on the planet.

00:03:24.142 --> 00:03:28.975
And somehow, we have to make changes
that will bring that down to zero.

00:03:29.617 --> 00:03:31.761
It's been constantly going up.

00:03:31.785 --> 00:03:36.390
It's only various economic changes
that have even flattened it at all,

00:03:36.414 --> 00:03:39.871
so we have to go
from rapidly rising to falling,

00:03:39.895 --> 00:03:41.977
and falling all the way to zero.

00:03:42.001 --> 00:03:45.976
This equation has four factors,
a little bit of multiplication.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.764
So you've got a thing on the left,
CO2, that you want to get to zero,

00:03:49.788 --> 00:03:53.178
and that's going to be based
on the number of people,

00:03:53.202 --> 00:03:56.592
the services each person
is using on average,

00:03:56.616 --> 00:03:59.485
the energy, on average, for each service,

00:03:59.509 --> 00:04:03.341
and the CO2 being put out
per unit of energy.

00:04:03.732 --> 00:04:05.685
So let's look at each one of these,

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.579
and see how we can get this down to zero.

00:04:09.238 --> 00:04:12.790
Probably, one of these numbers is going
to have to get pretty near to zero.

00:04:12.814 --> 00:04:13.996
(Laughter)

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.994
That's back from high school algebra.

00:04:16.018 --> 00:04:17.338
But let's take a look.

00:04:17.698 --> 00:04:19.550
First, we've got population.

00:04:20.194 --> 00:04:22.976
The world today has 6.8 billion people.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.203
That's headed up to about nine billion.

00:04:25.227 --> 00:04:29.288
Now, if we do a really great job
on new vaccines,

00:04:29.312 --> 00:04:31.769
health care, reproductive health services,

00:04:31.793 --> 00:04:34.894
we could lower that by,
perhaps, 10 or 15 percent.

00:04:34.918 --> 00:04:38.709
But there, we see
an increase of about 1.3.

00:04:39.425 --> 00:04:42.018
The second factor is the services we use.

00:04:42.455 --> 00:04:44.220
This encompasses everything:

00:04:44.244 --> 00:04:48.417
the food we eat, clothing, TV, heating.

00:04:48.777 --> 00:04:50.414
These are very good things.

00:04:50.929 --> 00:04:54.636
Getting rid of poverty means
providing these services

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.665
to almost everyone on the planet.

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:59.976
And it's a great thing
for this number to go up.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.239
In the rich world, perhaps
the top one billion,

00:05:02.263 --> 00:05:04.648
we probably could cut back and use less,

00:05:04.672 --> 00:05:08.788
but every year, this number,
on average, is going to go up,

00:05:08.812 --> 00:05:11.976
and so, overall,
that will more than double

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.439
the services delivered per person.

00:05:15.138 --> 00:05:17.241
Here we have a very basic service:

00:05:17.265 --> 00:05:20.677
Do you have lighting in your house
to be able to read your homework?

00:05:20.701 --> 00:05:22.220
And, in fact, these kids don't,

00:05:22.244 --> 00:05:24.562
so they're going out and reading
their schoolwork

00:05:24.586 --> 00:05:25.980
under the street lamps.

00:05:27.278 --> 00:05:30.976
Now, efficiency, "E,"
the energy for each service --

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.977
here, finally we have some good news.

00:05:33.001 --> 00:05:34.863
We have something that's not going up.

00:05:34.887 --> 00:05:37.976
Through various inventions
and new ways of doing lighting,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.431
through different types of cars,
different ways of building buildings --

00:05:43.455 --> 00:05:45.090
there are a lot of services

00:05:45.114 --> 00:05:48.454
where you can bring the energy
for that service down

00:05:48.478 --> 00:05:49.976
quite substantially.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.495
Some individual services
even bring it down by 90 percent.

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:56.865
There are other services,
like how we make fertilizer,

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:58.531
or how we do air transport,

00:05:58.555 --> 00:06:01.472
where the rooms for improvement
are far, far less.

00:06:01.896 --> 00:06:06.194
And so overall, if we're optimistic,
we may get a reduction

00:06:06.218 --> 00:06:11.087
of a factor of three to even,
perhaps, a factor of six.

00:06:11.608 --> 00:06:13.976
But for these first three factors now,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.060
we've gone from 26 billion
to, at best, maybe 13 billion tons,

00:06:19.084 --> 00:06:20.545
and that just won't cut it.

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:24.797
So let's look at this fourth factor --
this is going to be a key one --

00:06:24.821 --> 00:06:30.710
and this is the amount of CO2
put out per each unit of energy.

00:06:31.174 --> 00:06:34.699
So the question is:
Can you actually get that to zero?

00:06:34.723 --> 00:06:37.629
If you burn coal, no.

00:06:37.653 --> 00:06:39.128
If you burn natural gas, no.

00:06:39.152 --> 00:06:42.255
Almost every way
we make electricity today,

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:47.831
except for the emerging renewables
and nuclear, puts out CO2.

00:06:48.291 --> 00:06:51.544
And so, what we're going to have
to do at a global scale,

00:06:51.568 --> 00:06:53.423
is create a new system.

00:06:53.873 --> 00:06:55.738
So we need energy miracles.

00:06:56.526 --> 00:07:00.819
Now, when I use the term "miracle,"
I don't mean something that's impossible.

00:07:00.843 --> 00:07:03.263
The microprocessor is a miracle.

00:07:03.287 --> 00:07:05.272
The personal computer is a miracle.

00:07:05.296 --> 00:07:07.763
The Internet and its services
are a miracle.

00:07:07.787 --> 00:07:12.402
So the people here have participated
in the creation of many miracles.

00:07:12.857 --> 00:07:14.834
Usually, we don't have a deadline

00:07:14.858 --> 00:07:17.336
where you have to get the miracle
by a certain date.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.341
Usually, you just kind of stand by,
and some come along, some don't.

00:07:21.365 --> 00:07:25.464
This is a case where we actually
have to drive at full speed

00:07:25.488 --> 00:07:29.479
and get a miracle
in a pretty tight timeline.

00:07:30.489 --> 00:07:33.434
Now, I thought, "How could
I really capture this?

00:07:33.458 --> 00:07:35.681
Is there some kind
of natural illustration,

00:07:35.705 --> 00:07:39.575
some demonstration that would grab
people's imagination here?"

00:07:40.242 --> 00:07:43.976
I thought back to a year ago
when I brought mosquitoes,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.630
and somehow people enjoyed that.

00:07:46.654 --> 00:07:48.261
(Laughter)

00:07:48.285 --> 00:07:52.331
It really got them involved
in the idea of, you know,

00:07:52.355 --> 00:07:54.407
there are people who live with mosquitoes.

00:07:54.431 --> 00:07:58.045
With energy, all I could
come up with is this.

00:07:58.841 --> 00:08:01.975
I decided that releasing fireflies

00:08:01.999 --> 00:08:05.632
would be my contribution
to the environment here this year.

00:08:06.116 --> 00:08:08.976
So here we have some natural fireflies.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.609
I'm told they don't bite; in fact,
they might not even leave that jar.

00:08:12.633 --> 00:08:14.205
(Laughter)

00:08:15.833 --> 00:08:19.971
Now, there's all sorts of gimmicky
solutions like that one,

00:08:19.995 --> 00:08:21.896
but they don't really add up to much.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.943
We need solutions, either one or several,

00:08:25.967 --> 00:08:31.478
that have unbelievable scale
and unbelievable reliability.

00:08:32.008 --> 00:08:35.476
And although there's many directions
that people are seeking,

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:39.121
I really only see five
that can achieve the big numbers.

00:08:39.601 --> 00:08:43.888
I've left out tide,
geothermal, fusion, biofuels.

00:08:43.912 --> 00:08:45.889
Those may make some contribution,

00:08:45.913 --> 00:08:48.762
and if they can do better
than I expect, so much the better.

00:08:48.786 --> 00:08:52.708
But my key point here
is that we're going to have to work on

00:08:52.732 --> 00:08:54.458
each of these five,

00:08:54.482 --> 00:08:58.279
and we can't give up any of them
because they look daunting,

00:08:58.303 --> 00:09:01.164
because they all have
significant challenges.

00:09:01.801 --> 00:09:04.421
Let's look first at burning fossil fuels,

00:09:04.445 --> 00:09:07.286
either burning coal
or burning natural gas.

00:09:07.761 --> 00:09:11.847
What you need to do there seems
like it might be simple, but it's not.

00:09:11.871 --> 00:09:14.304
And that's to take all the CO2,

00:09:14.328 --> 00:09:16.976
after you've burned it,
going out the flue,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.145
pressurize it, create a liquid,
put it somewhere,

00:09:20.169 --> 00:09:21.599
and hope it stays there.

00:09:22.192 --> 00:09:23.814
Now, we have some pilot things

00:09:23.838 --> 00:09:26.177
that do this at the 60 to 80
percent level.

00:09:26.201 --> 00:09:30.600
But getting up to that full percentage --
that will be very tricky.

00:09:30.624 --> 00:09:36.196
And agreeing on where these CO2
quantities should be put will be hard,

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.882
but the toughest one here
is this long-term issue:

00:09:38.906 --> 00:09:40.446
Who's going to be sure?

00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:42.068
Who's going to guarantee

00:09:42.092 --> 00:09:45.161
something that is literally
billions of times larger

00:09:45.185 --> 00:09:49.331
than any type of waste you think of
in terms of nuclear or other things?

00:09:49.355 --> 00:09:51.835
This is a lot of volume.

00:09:52.434 --> 00:09:53.640
So that's a tough one.

00:09:54.267 --> 00:09:55.602
Next would be nuclear.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.976
It also has three big problems:

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.976
cost, particularly in highly
regulated countries, is high;

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.654
the issue of safety, really feeling good
about nothing could go wrong,

00:10:07.678 --> 00:10:10.682
that, even though you have
these human operators,

00:10:10.706 --> 00:10:13.055
the fuel doesn't get used for weapons.

00:10:13.456 --> 00:10:15.411
And then what do you do with the waste?

00:10:15.435 --> 00:10:18.839
Although it's not very large,
there are a lot of concerns about that.

00:10:18.863 --> 00:10:20.528
People need to feel good about it.

00:10:20.552 --> 00:10:24.976
So three very tough problems
that might be solvable,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.583
and so, should be worked on.

00:10:27.189 --> 00:10:29.880
The last three of the five,
I've grouped together.

00:10:29.904 --> 00:10:33.319
These are what people often refer to
as the renewable sources.

00:10:33.841 --> 00:10:37.864
And they actually -- although it's great
they don't require fuel --

00:10:37.888 --> 00:10:39.864
they have some disadvantages.

00:10:40.317 --> 00:10:46.159
One is that the density of energy
gathered in these technologies

00:10:46.183 --> 00:10:48.246
is dramatically less than a power plant.

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:49.952
This is energy farming,

00:10:49.976 --> 00:10:54.097
so you're talking about many square miles,
thousands of times more area

00:10:54.121 --> 00:10:56.625
than you think of
as a normal energy plant.

00:10:57.498 --> 00:11:00.086
Also, these are intermittent sources.

00:11:00.110 --> 00:11:03.525
The sun doesn't shine all day,
it doesn't shine every day,

00:11:03.549 --> 00:11:05.976
and likewise, the wind
doesn't blow all the time.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.389
And so, if you depend on these sources,

00:11:08.413 --> 00:11:10.763
you have to have some way
of getting the energy

00:11:10.787 --> 00:11:13.762
during those time periods
that it's not available.

00:11:14.158 --> 00:11:16.783
So we've got big cost challenges here.

00:11:17.238 --> 00:11:19.136
We have transmission challenges;

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.724
for example, say this energy source
is outside your country,

00:11:22.748 --> 00:11:24.841
you not only need the technology,

00:11:24.865 --> 00:11:29.238
but you have to deal with the risk
of the energy coming from elsewhere.

00:11:29.262 --> 00:11:31.171
And, finally, this storage problem.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:33.301
To dimensionalize this,

00:11:33.325 --> 00:11:36.878
I went through and looked
at all the types of batteries made --

00:11:36.902 --> 00:11:41.414
for cars, for computers, for phones,
for flashlights, for everything --

00:11:41.438 --> 00:11:45.932
and compared that to the amount
of electrical energy the world uses.

00:11:46.384 --> 00:11:49.977
What I found is that all
the batteries we make now

00:11:50.001 --> 00:11:53.228
could store less than 10 minutes
of all the energy.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.368
And so, in fact, we need
a big breakthrough here,

00:11:57.392 --> 00:12:01.260
something that's going to be
a factor of 100 better

00:12:01.284 --> 00:12:03.117
than the approaches we have now.

00:12:03.141 --> 00:12:06.906
It's not impossible,
but it's not a very easy thing.

00:12:07.334 --> 00:12:10.976
Now, this shows up when you try
to get the intermittent source

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.152
to be above, say, 20 to 30 percent
of what you're using.

00:12:15.176 --> 00:12:17.770
If you're counting on it for 100 percent,

00:12:17.794 --> 00:12:21.453
you need an incredible miracle battery.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.617
Now, how are we going to go forward
on this -- what's the right approach?

00:12:26.641 --> 00:12:30.220
Is it a Manhattan Project?
What's the thing that can get us there?

00:12:30.244 --> 00:12:35.055
Well, we need lots of companies
working on this -- hundreds.

00:12:35.079 --> 00:12:38.658
In each of these five paths,
we need at least a hundred people.

00:12:38.682 --> 00:12:41.392
A lot of them, you'll look at
and say, "They're crazy."

00:12:41.416 --> 00:12:42.597
That's good.

00:12:42.621 --> 00:12:45.551
And, I think, here in the TED group,

00:12:45.575 --> 00:12:48.786
we have many people
who are already pursuing this.

00:12:49.556 --> 00:12:52.976
Bill Gross has several companies,
including one called eSolar

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.782
that has some great
solar thermal technologies.

00:12:55.806 --> 00:12:59.256
Vinod Khosla is investing
in dozens of companies

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:03.207
that are doing great things
and have interesting possibilities,

00:13:03.231 --> 00:13:05.380
and I'm trying to help back that.

00:13:05.404 --> 00:13:08.976
Nathan Myhrvold and I
actually are backing a company

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.772
that, perhaps surprisingly,
is actually taking the nuclear approach.

00:13:12.796 --> 00:13:16.734
There are some innovations
in nuclear: modular, liquid.

00:13:17.398 --> 00:13:21.171
Innovation really stopped
in this industry quite some ago,

00:13:21.195 --> 00:13:24.290
so the idea that there's some
good ideas laying around

00:13:24.314 --> 00:13:26.039
is not all that surprising.

00:13:26.529 --> 00:13:32.319
The idea of TerraPower is that,
instead of burning a part of uranium --

00:13:32.343 --> 00:13:35.462
the one percent, which is the U235 --

00:13:35.486 --> 00:13:39.202
we decided, "Let's burn
the 99 percent, the U238."

00:13:39.738 --> 00:13:42.091
It is kind of a crazy idea.

00:13:42.115 --> 00:13:45.258
In fact, people had talked
about it for a long time,

00:13:45.282 --> 00:13:49.443
but they could never simulate properly
whether it would work or not,

00:13:49.467 --> 00:13:52.332
and so it's through the advent
of modern supercomputers

00:13:52.356 --> 00:13:54.487
that now you can simulate
and see that, yes,

00:13:54.511 --> 00:13:59.719
with the right materials approach,
this looks like it would work.

00:14:00.193 --> 00:14:02.976
And because you're burning
that 99 percent,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.383
you have greatly improved cost profile.

00:14:07.407 --> 00:14:11.617
You actually burn up the waste,
and you can actually use as fuel

00:14:11.641 --> 00:14:14.666
all the leftover waste
from today's reactors.

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:18.481
So instead of worrying about them,
you just take that, it's a great thing.

00:14:18.828 --> 00:14:23.323
It breeds this uranium as it goes along,
so it's kind of like a candle.

00:14:23.347 --> 00:14:27.079
You see it's a log there, often
referred to as a traveling wave reactor.

00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:31.419
In terms of fuel,
this really solves the problem.

00:14:31.443 --> 00:14:34.344
I've got a picture here
of a place in Kentucky.

00:14:34.368 --> 00:14:36.568
This is the leftover, the 99 percent,

00:14:36.592 --> 00:14:38.822
where they've taken out
the part they burn now,

00:14:38.846 --> 00:14:40.416
so it's called depleted uranium.

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:43.287
That would power the US
for hundreds of years.

00:14:43.311 --> 00:14:46.846
And simply by filtering seawater
in an inexpensive process,

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:50.679
you'd have enough fuel for the entire
lifetime of the rest of the planet.

00:14:51.054 --> 00:14:55.115
So, you know, it's got lots
of challenges ahead,

00:14:55.139 --> 00:15:00.534
but it is an example of the many
hundreds and hundreds of ideas

00:15:00.558 --> 00:15:02.417
that we need to move forward.

00:15:03.407 --> 00:15:06.105
So let's think: How should
we measure ourselves?

00:15:06.129 --> 00:15:08.976
What should our report card look like?

00:15:09.356 --> 00:15:11.880
Well, let's go out to where
we really need to get,

00:15:11.904 --> 00:15:14.047
and then look at the intermediate.

00:15:14.071 --> 00:15:19.093
For 2050, you've heard many people
talk about this 80 percent reduction.

00:15:19.842 --> 00:15:22.894
That really is very important,
that we get there.

00:15:22.918 --> 00:15:27.339
And that 20 percent will be used up
by things going on in poor countries --

00:15:27.363 --> 00:15:32.757
still some agriculture; hopefully,
we will have cleaned up forestry, cement.

00:15:32.781 --> 00:15:35.770
So, to get to that 80 percent,

00:15:35.794 --> 00:15:40.299
the developed countries,
including countries like China,

00:15:40.323 --> 00:15:44.722
will have had to switch
their electricity generation altogether.

00:15:45.125 --> 00:15:50.976
The other grade is: Are we deploying
this zero-emission technology,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.397
have we deployed it
in all the developed countries

00:15:53.421 --> 00:15:56.208
and are in the process
of getting it elsewhere?

00:15:56.232 --> 00:15:57.976
That's super important.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.339
That's a key element
of making that report card.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.305
Backing up from there, what should
the 2020 report card look like?

00:16:06.755 --> 00:16:09.073
Well, again, it should have
the two elements.

00:16:09.097 --> 00:16:13.236
We should go through these efficiency
measures to start getting reductions:

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.524
The less we emit,
the less that sum will be of CO2,

00:16:16.548 --> 00:16:18.620
and therefore, the less the temperature.

00:16:18.644 --> 00:16:21.573
But in some ways, the grade we get there,

00:16:21.597 --> 00:16:25.841
doing things that don't get us
all the way to the big reductions,

00:16:25.865 --> 00:16:29.709
is only equally, or maybe even slightly
less, important than the other,

00:16:29.733 --> 00:16:33.489
which is the piece of innovation
on these breakthroughs.

00:16:33.513 --> 00:16:36.751
These breakthroughs,
we need to move those at full speed,

00:16:36.775 --> 00:16:39.200
and we can measure that
in terms of companies,

00:16:39.224 --> 00:16:42.118
pilot projects, regulatory things
that have been changed.

00:16:42.598 --> 00:16:45.572
There's a lot of great books
that have been written about this.

00:16:45.596 --> 00:16:47.976
The Al Gore book, "Our Choice,"

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.580
and the David MacKay book,
"Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air."

00:16:51.604 --> 00:16:54.780
They really go through it
and create a framework

00:16:54.804 --> 00:16:56.637
that this can be discussed broadly,

00:16:56.661 --> 00:16:58.618
because we need broad backing for this.

00:16:58.986 --> 00:17:01.213
There's a lot that has to come together.

00:17:01.237 --> 00:17:02.719
So this is a wish.

00:17:02.743 --> 00:17:06.920
It's a very concrete wish
that we invent this technology.

00:17:07.372 --> 00:17:10.461
If you gave me only one wish
for the next 50 years --

00:17:10.485 --> 00:17:12.462
I could pick who's president,

00:17:12.486 --> 00:17:15.248
I could pick a vaccine,
which is something I love,

00:17:15.272 --> 00:17:17.329
or I could pick that this thing

00:17:17.353 --> 00:17:20.814
that's half the cost with no CO2
gets invented --

00:17:20.838 --> 00:17:22.745
this is the wish I would pick.

00:17:22.769 --> 00:17:24.854
This is the one with the greatest impact.

00:17:24.878 --> 00:17:26.523
If we don't get this wish,

00:17:26.547 --> 00:17:29.985
the division between the people
who think short term and long term

00:17:30.009 --> 00:17:31.167
will be terrible,

00:17:31.191 --> 00:17:34.135
between the US and China,
between poor countries and rich,

00:17:34.159 --> 00:17:35.353
and most of all,

00:17:35.377 --> 00:17:38.441
the lives of those two billion
will be far worse.

00:17:39.158 --> 00:17:40.976
So what do we have to do?

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.824
What am I appealing to you
to step forward and drive?

00:17:46.189 --> 00:17:48.770
We need to go for more research funding.

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:51.815
When countries get together
in places like Copenhagen,

00:17:51.839 --> 00:17:54.258
they shouldn't just discuss the CO2.

00:17:54.282 --> 00:17:56.649
They should discuss
this innovation agenda.

00:17:56.673 --> 00:18:00.976
You'd be stunned at the ridiculously
low levels of spending

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.715
on these innovative approaches.

00:18:03.183 --> 00:18:06.976
We do need the market incentives --
CO2 tax, cap and trade --

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.524
something that gets
that price signal out there.

00:18:09.881 --> 00:18:11.479
We need to get the message out.

00:18:11.503 --> 00:18:13.907
We need to have this dialogue
be a more rational,

00:18:13.931 --> 00:18:15.521
more understandable dialogue,

00:18:15.545 --> 00:18:18.076
including the steps
that the government takes.

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:21.750
This is an important wish,
but it is one I think we can achieve.

00:18:22.416 --> 00:18:23.569
Thank you.

00:18:23.593 --> 00:18:30.593
(Applause)

00:18:32.975 --> 00:18:34.976
(Applause ends)

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:36.216
Thank you.

00:18:37.303 --> 00:18:39.148
Chris Anderson: Thank you. Thank you.

00:18:39.172 --> 00:18:44.233
(Applause)

00:18:44.257 --> 00:18:45.755
CA: Thank you.

00:18:45.779 --> 00:18:49.841
So to understand more about TerraPower.

00:18:50.399 --> 00:18:54.393
I mean, first of all, can you give a sense
of what scale of investment this is?

00:18:54.898 --> 00:18:59.232
Bill Gates: To actually do the software,
buy the supercomputer,

00:18:59.256 --> 00:19:01.585
hire all the great scientists,
which we've done,

00:19:01.609 --> 00:19:03.866
that's only tens of millions.

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:07.838
And even once we test our materials out
in a Russian reactor

00:19:07.862 --> 00:19:11.037
to make sure our materials work properly,

00:19:11.061 --> 00:19:13.578
then you'll only be up
in the hundreds of millions.

00:19:13.602 --> 00:19:15.960
The tough thing
is building the pilot reactor --

00:19:15.984 --> 00:19:20.788
finding the several billion,
finding the regulator, the location

00:19:20.812 --> 00:19:23.071
that will actually build
the first one of these.

00:19:23.095 --> 00:19:27.257
Once you get the first one built,
if it works as advertised,

00:19:27.281 --> 00:19:28.631
then it's just clear as day,

00:19:28.655 --> 00:19:31.851
because the economics,
the energy density, are so different

00:19:31.875 --> 00:19:33.289
than nuclear as we know it.

00:19:33.313 --> 00:19:34.775
CA: So to understand it right,

00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:37.081
this involves building
deep into the ground,

00:19:37.105 --> 00:19:42.665
almost like a vertical column
of nuclear fuel, of this spent uranium,

00:19:42.689 --> 00:19:45.829
and then the process starts
at the top and kind of works down?

00:19:45.853 --> 00:19:47.030
BG: That's right.

00:19:47.054 --> 00:19:49.113
Today, you're always
refueling the reactor,

00:19:49.137 --> 00:19:52.329
so you have lots of people and lots
of controls that can go wrong,

00:19:52.353 --> 00:19:55.092
where you're opening it up
and moving things in and out --

00:19:55.116 --> 00:19:57.273
that's not good.

00:19:57.297 --> 00:19:58.470
So if you have very --

00:19:58.494 --> 00:19:59.583
(Laughter)

00:19:59.607 --> 00:20:02.354
very cheap fuel
that you can put 60 years in --

00:20:02.378 --> 00:20:03.932
just think of it as a log --

00:20:03.956 --> 00:20:07.494
put it down and not have
those same complexities.

00:20:07.518 --> 00:20:12.423
And it just sits there and burns
for the 60 years, and then it's done.

00:20:12.447 --> 00:20:16.385
CA: It's a nuclear power plant
that is its own waste disposal solution.

00:20:16.409 --> 00:20:18.303
BG: Yeah; what happens with the waste,

00:20:18.327 --> 00:20:23.707
you can let it sit there -- there's a lot
less waste under this approach --

00:20:23.731 --> 00:20:25.367
then you can actually take that

00:20:25.391 --> 00:20:27.976
and put it into another one and burn that.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.206
And we start out, actually,
by taking the waste that exists today

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:36.462
that's sitting in these cooling pools
or dry-casking by reactors --

00:20:36.486 --> 00:20:38.638
that's our fuel to begin with.

00:20:38.662 --> 00:20:41.269
So the thing that's been a problem
from those reactors

00:20:41.293 --> 00:20:43.220
is actually what gets fed into ours,

00:20:43.244 --> 00:20:46.231
and you're reducing the volume
of the waste quite dramatically

00:20:46.255 --> 00:20:48.232
as you're going through this process.

00:20:48.256 --> 00:20:50.831
CA: You're talking
to different people around the world

00:20:50.855 --> 00:20:52.144
about the possibilities.

00:20:52.168 --> 00:20:55.576
Where is there most interest
in actually doing something with this?

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:59.755
BG: Well, we haven't picked
a particular place,

00:20:59.779 --> 00:21:03.239
and there's all these interesting
disclosure rules

00:21:03.263 --> 00:21:05.739
about anything that's called "nuclear."

00:21:05.763 --> 00:21:08.692
So we've got a lot of interest.

00:21:08.716 --> 00:21:11.791
People from the company
have been in Russia, India, China.

00:21:11.815 --> 00:21:14.429
I've been back seeing
the secretary of energy here,

00:21:14.453 --> 00:21:17.785
talking about how this fits
into the energy agenda.

00:21:17.809 --> 00:21:19.385
So I'm optimistic.

00:21:19.409 --> 00:21:21.586
The French and Japanese
have done some work.

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:25.270
This is a variant on something
that has been done.

00:21:25.294 --> 00:21:28.976
It's an important advance,
but it's like a fast reactor,

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.976
and a lot of countries have built them,

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.574
so anybody who's done
a fast reactor is a candidate

00:21:33.598 --> 00:21:35.976
to be where the first one gets built.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.442
CA: So, in your mind,

00:21:39.466 --> 00:21:44.224
timescale and likelihood of actually
taking something like this live?

00:21:44.248 --> 00:21:50.335
BG: Well, we need -- for one of these
high-scale, electro-generation things

00:21:50.359 --> 00:21:51.517
that's very cheap,

00:21:51.541 --> 00:21:55.219
we have 20 years to invent
and then 20 years to deploy.

00:21:55.243 --> 00:21:56.999
That's sort of the deadline

00:21:57.023 --> 00:22:02.281
that the environmental models
have shown us that we have to meet.

00:22:02.305 --> 00:22:07.717
And TerraPower -- if things go well,
which is wishing for a lot --

00:22:07.741 --> 00:22:09.384
could easily meet that.

00:22:09.408 --> 00:22:12.680
And there are, fortunately
now, dozens of companies --

00:22:12.704 --> 00:22:14.055
we need it to be hundreds --

00:22:14.079 --> 00:22:16.296
who, likewise, if their science goes well,

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:19.215
if the funding for their pilot
plants goes well,

00:22:19.239 --> 00:22:21.265
that they can compete for this.

00:22:21.289 --> 00:22:23.263
And it's best if multiple succeed,

00:22:23.287 --> 00:22:25.976
because then you could use
a mix of these things.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.081
We certainly need one to succeed.

00:22:28.105 --> 00:22:31.064
CA: In terms of big-scale
possible game changers,

00:22:31.088 --> 00:22:33.822
is this the biggest
that you're aware of out there?

00:22:33.846 --> 00:22:38.195
BG: An energy breakthrough
is the most important thing.

00:22:38.219 --> 00:22:41.202
It would have been, even
without the environmental constraint,

00:22:41.226 --> 00:22:45.089
but the environmental constraint
just makes it so much greater.

00:22:45.113 --> 00:22:48.437
In the nuclear space,
there are other innovators.

00:22:48.461 --> 00:22:51.451
You know, we don't know their work
as well as we know this one,

00:22:51.475 --> 00:22:54.732
but the modular people,
that's a different approach.

00:22:54.756 --> 00:22:58.361
There's a liquid-type reactor,
which seems a little hard,

00:22:58.385 --> 00:23:00.621
but maybe they say that about us.

00:23:00.645 --> 00:23:02.976
And so, there are different ones,

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.976
but the beauty of this
is a molecule of uranium

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.090
has a million times as much energy
as a molecule of, say, coal.

00:23:10.702 --> 00:23:13.718
And so, if you can
deal with the negatives,

00:23:13.742 --> 00:23:17.594
which are essentially the radiation,
the footprint and cost,

00:23:17.618 --> 00:23:21.609
the potential, in terms of effect
on land and various things,

00:23:21.633 --> 00:23:24.976
is almost in a class of its own.

00:23:26.039 --> 00:23:29.678
CA: If this doesn't work, then what?

00:23:29.702 --> 00:23:32.976
Do we have to start taking
emergency measures

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.098
to try and keep the temperature
of the earth stable?

00:23:36.122 --> 00:23:37.976
BG: If you get into that situation,

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.976
it's like if you've been overeating,
and you're about to have a heart attack.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.525
Then where do you go?

00:23:45.549 --> 00:23:47.482
You may need heart surgery or something.

00:23:47.506 --> 00:23:51.376
There is a line of research
on what's called geoengineering,

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:54.377
which are various techniques
that would delay the heating

00:23:54.401 --> 00:23:57.687
to buy us 20 or 30 years
to get our act together.

00:23:57.711 --> 00:24:01.319
Now, that's just an insurance policy;
you hope you don't need to do that.

00:24:01.343 --> 00:24:04.385
Some people say you shouldn't even
work on the insurance policy

00:24:04.409 --> 00:24:05.930
because it might make you lazy,

00:24:05.954 --> 00:24:09.820
that you'll keep eating because you know
heart surgery will be there to save you.

00:24:09.844 --> 00:24:12.961
I'm not sure that's wise,
given the importance of the problem,

00:24:12.985 --> 00:24:16.086
but there's now
the geoengineering discussion

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:20.317
about: Should that be in the back
pocket in case things happen faster,

00:24:20.341 --> 00:24:23.828
or this innovation goes
a lot slower than we expect?

00:24:25.549 --> 00:24:27.350
CA: Climate skeptics:

00:24:27.374 --> 00:24:30.880
If you had a sentence or two
to say to them,

00:24:30.904 --> 00:24:34.513
how might you persuade them
that they're wrong?

00:24:35.645 --> 00:24:38.696
BG: Well, unfortunately,
the skeptics come in different camps.

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:43.161
The ones who make scientific
arguments are very few.

00:24:43.185 --> 00:24:46.174
Are they saying there's negative
feedback effects

00:24:46.198 --> 00:24:48.400
that have to do with clouds
that offset things?

00:24:48.424 --> 00:24:51.732
There are very, very few things
that they can even say

00:24:51.756 --> 00:24:54.403
there's a chance
in a million of those things.

00:24:54.427 --> 00:24:57.631
The main problem we have here --
it's kind of like with AIDS:

00:24:57.655 --> 00:25:01.458
you make the mistake now,
and you pay for it a lot later.

00:25:01.482 --> 00:25:04.737
And so, when you have
all sorts of urgent problems,

00:25:04.761 --> 00:25:08.822
the idea of taking pain now
that has to do with a gain later,

00:25:08.846 --> 00:25:11.132
and a somewhat uncertain pain thing.

00:25:11.156 --> 00:25:17.244
In fact, the IPCC report --
that's not necessarily the worst case,

00:25:17.268 --> 00:25:21.343
and there are people in the rich world
who look at IPCC and say,

00:25:21.367 --> 00:25:23.151
"OK, that isn't that big of a deal."

00:25:23.175 --> 00:25:27.324
The fact is it's that uncertain part
that should move us towards this.

00:25:27.348 --> 00:25:28.980
But my dream here is that,

00:25:29.004 --> 00:25:32.664
if you can make it economic,
and meet the CO2 constraints,

00:25:32.688 --> 00:25:33.847
then the skeptics say,

00:25:33.871 --> 00:25:36.151
"OK, I don't care
that it doesn't put out CO2,

00:25:36.175 --> 00:25:37.855
I kind of wish it did put out CO2.

00:25:37.879 --> 00:25:39.235
But I guess I'll accept it,

00:25:39.259 --> 00:25:41.976
because it's cheaper
than what's come before."

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.831
(Applause)

00:25:46.855 --> 00:25:50.035
CA: So that would be your response
to the Bjørn Lomborg argument,

00:25:50.059 --> 00:25:54.515
basically if you spend all this energy
trying to solve the CO2 problem,

00:25:54.539 --> 00:25:56.633
it's going to take away
all your other goals

00:25:56.657 --> 00:25:59.650
of trying to rid the world
of poverty and malaria and so forth,

00:25:59.674 --> 00:26:01.907
it's a stupid waste
of the Earth's resources

00:26:01.931 --> 00:26:03.204
to put money towards that

00:26:03.228 --> 00:26:05.146
when there are better things we can do.

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:08.561
BG: Well, the actual
spending on the R&amp;D piece --

00:26:08.585 --> 00:26:12.081
say the US should spend 10 billion a year
more than it is right now --

00:26:12.105 --> 00:26:13.976
it's not that dramatic.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.976
It shouldn't take away from other things.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.420
The thing you get into big money on,
and reasonable people can disagree,

00:26:19.444 --> 00:26:21.610
is when you have something
that's non-economic

00:26:21.634 --> 00:26:23.253
and you're trying to fund that --

00:26:23.277 --> 00:26:25.205
that, to me, mostly is a waste.

00:26:25.229 --> 00:26:26.776
Unless you're very close,

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:30.444
and you're just funding the learning curve
and it's going to get very cheap,

00:26:30.468 --> 00:26:33.266
I believe we should try more things

00:26:33.290 --> 00:26:35.976
that have a potential
to be far less expensive.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.192
If the trade-off you get into is,
"Let's make energy super expensive,"

00:26:41.216 --> 00:26:43.238
then the rich can afford that.

00:26:43.262 --> 00:26:46.391
I mean, all of us here could pay
five times as much for our energy

00:26:46.415 --> 00:26:47.806
and not change our lifestyle.

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:50.094
The disaster is for that two billion.

00:26:50.118 --> 00:26:52.425
And even Lomborg has changed.

00:26:52.449 --> 00:26:56.976
His shtick now is, "Why isn't the R&amp;D
getting more discussed?"

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.513
He's still, because of his earlier stuff,

00:26:59.537 --> 00:27:01.437
still associated with the skeptic camp,

00:27:01.461 --> 00:27:04.234
but he's realized
that's a pretty lonely camp,

00:27:04.258 --> 00:27:07.516
and so, he's making the R&amp;D point.

00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:11.976
And so there is a thread of something
that I think is appropriate.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.976
The R&amp;D piece --
it's crazy how little it's funded.

00:27:15.556 --> 00:27:18.843
CA: Well, Bill, I suspect I speak
on behalf of most people here

00:27:18.867 --> 00:27:20.935
to say I really hope your wish comes true.

00:27:20.959 --> 00:27:22.131
Thank you so much.

00:27:22.155 --> 00:27:23.306
BG: Thank you.

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:28.722
(Applause)
