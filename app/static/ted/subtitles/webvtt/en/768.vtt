00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Someone once said that politics is, of course, "showbiz for ugly people."

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
So, on that basis, I feel like I've really arrived.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The other thing to think of is what an honor it is, as a politician,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
to give a TED talk, particularly here in the U.K.,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
where the reputation of politics, with the expenses scandal, has sunk so low.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
There was even a story recently that scientists had thought about

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
actually replacing rats in their experiments with politicians.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And someone asked,"Why?"

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and they said, "Well, there's no shortage of politicians,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
no one really minds what happens to them

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and, after all, there are some things that rats just won't do."

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
(Laughter)

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Now, I know you all love data, so I'm starting with a data-rich slide.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
This, I think, is the most important fact to bear in mind

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
in British politics or American politics,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and that is: We have run out of money.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
We have vast budget deficits.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
This is my global public debt clock,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and, as you can see, it's 32 trillion and counting.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And I think what this leads to

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
is a very simple recognition,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
that there's one question in politics at the moment above all other,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and it's this one: How do we make things better without spending more money?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Because there isn't going to be a lot of money to improve public services,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
or to improve government, or to improve so many of the things

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
that politicians talk about.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
So what follows from that is that if you think it's all about money --

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
you can only measure success in public services

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
in health care and education and policing by spending more money,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
you can only measure progress by spending money --

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
you're going to have a pretty miserable time.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
But if you think a whole lot of other things matter that lead up to well being --

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
things like your family relationships, friendship, community, values --

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
then, actually, this is an incredibly exciting time to be in politics.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And the really simple argument I want to make tonight,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
the really straightforward argument is this:

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
That if we combine the right political philosophy, the right political thinking,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
with the incredible information revolution that has taken place,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and that all of you know so much more about than I do,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I think there's an incredible opportunity to actually remake politics,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
remake government, remake public services,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and achieve what's up on that slide, which is a big increase in our well-being.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
That's the argument I want to make tonight.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
So, starting with the political philosophy.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Now I'm not saying for a minute that British Conservatives have all the answers.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Of course we don't.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
But there are two things at heart that I think drive a conservative philosophy

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
that are really relevant to this whole debate.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
The first is this: We believe that if you give people

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
more power and control over their lives,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
if you give people more choice,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
if you put them in the driving seat,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
then actually, you can create a stronger and better society.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And if you marry this fact with the incredible abundance

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
of information that we have in our world today,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
I think you can completely, as I've said,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
remake politics, remake government, remake your public services.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
The second thing we believe is we believe in going with the grain of human nature.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Politics and politicians will only succeed

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
if they actually try and treat with people as they are,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
rather than as they would like them to be.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Now, if you combine this very simple, very conservative thought --

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
go with the grain of human nature --

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
with all the advances in behavioral economics,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
some of which we were just hearing about,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
again, I think we can achieve a real increase in well-being,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
in happiness, in a stronger society

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
without necessarily having to spend a whole lot more money.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Now, why do I think now is the moment to make this argument?

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Well, I'm afraid you're going to suffer a short, condensed history lesson

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
about what I would say are the three passages of history:

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
the pre-bureaucratic age, the bureaucratic age

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
and what we now live in, which I think is a post-bureaucratic age.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
A simpler way of thinking of it

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
is that we have gone from a world of local control,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
then we went to a world of central control,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
and now we're in a world of people control.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Local power, central power, now, people power.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Now, here is King Cnut, king a thousand years ago.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Thought he could turn back the waves; couldn't turn back the waves.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Couldn't actually turn back very much,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
because if you were king a thousand years ago,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
while it still took hours and hours and weeks and weeks to traverse your own country,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
there wasn't much you were in charge of.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
You weren't in charge of policing, justice, education, health, welfare.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
You could just about go to war and that was about it.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
This was the pre-bureaucratic age,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
an age in which everything had to be local.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
You had to have local control because there was no nationally-available information

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
because travel was so restricted.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
So this was the pre-bureaucratic age.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Next part of the cold history lesson,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
the lovely picture of the British Industrial Revolution.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Suddenly, all sorts of transport, travel information were possible,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
and this gave birth to, what I like to call, the bureaucratic age.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And hopefully this slide is going to morph beautifully. There we are.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Suddenly, you have the big, strong, central state.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
It was able -- but only it was able -- to organize

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
health care, education, policing, justice.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And it was a world of, as I say, not local power, but now central power.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
It had sucked all that power up from the localities.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
It was able to do that itself.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
The next great stage, which all of you are so familiar with:

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
the massive information revolution.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Just consider this one fact:

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
One hundred years ago, sending these 10 words cost 50 dollars.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Right now, here we are linked up to Long Beach and everywhere else,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
and all these secret locations for a fraction of that cost,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
and we can send and receive huge quantities of information

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
without it costing anything.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000
So we're now living in a post-bureaucratic age,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
where genuine people power is possible.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Now, what does this mean for our politics,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
for our public services, for our government?

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Well I can't, in the time I've got, give huge numbers of examples,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
but let me just give a few of the ways that life can change.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
And this is so obvious, in a way, because

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
you think about how all of you have changed

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
the way we shop, the way we travel, the way that business is done.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
That is already happened; the information and Internet revolution

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
has actually gone all the way through our societies in so many different ways,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
but it hasn't, in every way, yet touched our government.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
So, how could this happen?

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Well, I think there are three chief ways that it should make an enormous difference:

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
in transparency, in greater choice and in accountability,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
in giving us that genuine people power.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
If we take transparency, here is one of my favorite websites,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
the Missouri Accountability Portal.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
In the old days, only the government could hold the information,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
and only a few elected people could try and grab that information

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
and question it and challenge it.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Now here, on one website, one state in America,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
every single dollar spent by that government

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
is searchable, is analyzable, is checkable.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Think of the huge change that means:

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Any business that wants to bid for a government contract

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
can see what currently is being spent.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Anyone thinking, "I could do that service better, I could deliver it cheaper,"

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
it's all available there.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
We have only, in government and in politics,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
started to scratch the surface of what people are doing in the commercial world

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
with the information revolution.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
So, complete transparency will make a huge difference.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
In this country, if we win the election,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
we are going to make all government spending over 25,000 pounds

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
transparent and available online, searchable for anyone to see.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
We're going to make every contract -- we're announcing this today --

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
available on the Internet so anyone can see

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
what the terms are, what the conditions are,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
driving huge value for money,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
but also huge increases, I believe, in well-being as well.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Choice. Now you all shop online, compare online, do everything online,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
and yet this revolution has hardly touched the surface

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
of public services like education, or health care or policing,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
and you're going to see this change massively.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
We should be making this change

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
with the information revolution in our country,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000
with searchable health sites, so you can see what operations work out properly,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
what records doctors have, the cleanliness of hospitals,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
who does best at infection control --

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
all of the information that would once be locked in the Department of Health

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
is now available for all of us to see.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
And the third of these big changes: accountability.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
This, I think, is a huge change.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
It is a crime map. This is a crime map from Chicago.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
So, instead of having a situation where only the police have the information

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
about which crimes are committed where,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
and we have to employ people in government

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
to try and hold the police to account,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
suddenly, we've got this vast opportunity for people power,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
where we, as citizens, can see what crimes are being committed --

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
where, when and by whom --

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
and we can hold the police to account.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
And you can see this looks a bit like a chef's hat,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
but actually that's an assault, the one in blue.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
You can see what crime is committed where,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
and you have the opportunity to hold your police force to account.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000
So those three ways -- transparency, accountability and choice --

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
will make a huge difference.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Now I also said the other principle

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
that I think we should work on is understanding of people,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
is recognizing that going with the grain of human nature

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
you can achieve so much more.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Now, we're got a huge revolution in understanding

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
of why people behave in the way that they do,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
and a great opportunity to put that knowledge and information to greater use.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
We're working with some of these people.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
We're being advised by some of these people, as was said,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
to try and bring all the experience to book.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Let me just give you one example that I think is incredibly simple, and I love.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
We want to get people to be more energy efficient.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Why? It cuts fuel poverty, it cuts their bills,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
and it cuts carbon emissions at the same time.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
How do you do it?

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Well, we've had government information campaigns over the years

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
when they tell you to switch off the lights when you leave the home.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
We even had -- one government minister once told us to

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
brush our teeth in the dark.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
I don't think they lasted very long.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Look at what this does. This is a simple piece of behavioral economics.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
The best way to get someone to cut their electricity bill

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
is to show them their own spending,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
to show them what their neighbors are spending,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
and then show what an energy conscious neighbor is spending.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
That sort of behavioral economics

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
can transform people's behavior

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
in a way that all the bullying and all the information

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
and all the badgering from a government cannot possibly achieve.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Other examples are recycling.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
We all know we need to recycle more.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
How do we make it happen?

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
All the proof from America is that actually, if you pay people to recycle,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
if you give them a carrot rather than a stick,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
you can transform their behavior.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
So what does all this add up to?

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Here are my two favorite U.S. speeches of the last 50 years.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Obviously, here we have JFK with that incredibly simple

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
and powerful formulation,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000
"Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country,"

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
an incredibly noble sentiment.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
But when he made that speech, what could you do

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
to build the stronger, better society?

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
You could fight for your country, you could die for your country,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
you could serve in your country's civil service,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
but you didn't really have the information and the knowledge

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
and the ability to help build the stronger society in the way that you do now.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
And I think an even more wonderful speech,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
which I'm going to read a big chunk of,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
which sums up what I said at the beginning

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
about believing there is more to life than money,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
and more that we should try and measure than money.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
And it is Robert Kennedy's beautiful description

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
of why gross national product captures so little:

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
It "does not allow for the health of our children,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
the quality of their education, or the joy of their play.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
the intelligence of our public debate.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
It measures neither our wit nor our courage,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
neither our wisdom nor our learning,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
It measures everything, in short,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
except that which makes life worthwhile."

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Again, a sentiment that was so noble and beautifully put 40 years ago,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
and a beautiful dream 40 years ago,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
but now with the huge advances in information technology,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
with the massive changes in behavioral economics,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
with all that we know about how you advance well-being,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
that if we combine those insights

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
of giving power to people, and using information to make that possible,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
and using the insight of going with the grain of human nature,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
while at the same time, understanding why people behave in the way they do,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
it is a dream more easy to realize today

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
than it was when it was made in that beautiful speech 40 years ago.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Thank you.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:36.000
(Applause)
