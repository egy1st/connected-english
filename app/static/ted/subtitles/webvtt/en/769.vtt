00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I'd like to share with you a discovery that I made a few months ago

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
while writing an article for Italian Wired.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I always keep my thesaurus handy whenever I'm writing anything,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
but I'd already finished editing the piece,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and I realized that I had never once in my life

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
looked up the word "disabled" to see what I'd find.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Let me read you the entry.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000
"Disabled, adjective: crippled, helpless, useless, wrecked,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
stalled, maimed, wounded, mangled, lame, mutilated,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:51.000
run-down, worn-out, weakened, impotent, castrated, paralyzed, handicapped,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
senile, decrepit, laid-up, done-up, done-for, done-in

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
cracked-up, counted-out;

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
see also hurt, useless and weak.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Antonyms, healthy, strong, capable."

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
it was so ludicrous,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
but I'd just gotten past "mangled," and my voice broke,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and I had to stop and collect myself

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:34.000
from the emotional shock and impact that the assault from these words unleashed.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
You know, of course, this is my raggedy old thesaurus

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
so I'm thinking this must be an ancient print date, right?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
But, in fact, the print date was the early 1980s,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
when I would have been starting primary school

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and as related to the other kids and the world around me.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And, needless to say, thank God I wasn't using a thesaurus back then.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I mean, from this entry, it would seem that I was born into a world

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
that perceived someone like me

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
when in fact, today I'm celebrated for the opportunities and adventures

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
my life has procured.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000
So, I immediately went to look up the 2009 online edition,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
expecting to find a revision worth noting.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Here's the updated version of this entry.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Unfortunately, it's not much better.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I find the last two words under "Near Antonyms," particularly unsettling:

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
"whole" and "wholesome."

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
So, it's not just about the words.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
It's what we believe about people when we name them with these words.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
It's about the values behind the words, and how we construct those values.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Our language affects our thinking and how we view the world

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and how we view other people.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
In fact, many ancient societies, including the Greeks and the Romans,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
believed that to utter a curse verbally was so powerful,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000
because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
So, what reality do we want to call into existence:

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
a person who is limited, or a person who's empowered?

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.000
By casually doing something as simple as naming a person, a child,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.000
we might be putting lids and casting shadows on their power.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Wouldn't we want to open doors for them instead?

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
One such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
at the A.I. duPont Institute in Wilmington, Delaware.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
His name was Dr. Pizzutillo,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
an Italian American, whose name, apparently,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
was too difficult for most Americans to pronounce,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
so he went by Dr. P.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And Dr. P always wore really colorful bow ties

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
and had the very perfect disposition to work with children.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000
I loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
with the exception of my physical therapy sessions.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
I had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
with these thick, elastic bands -- different colors,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
you know -- to help build up my leg muscles,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
and I hated these bands more than anything --

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
I hated them, had names for them. I hated them.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And, you know, I was already bargaining, as a five year-old child,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
with Dr. P to try to get out of doing these exercises,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
unsuccessfully, of course.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And, one day, he came in to my session --

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
exhaustive and unforgiving, these sessions --

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000
and he said to me, "Wow. Aimee, you are such a strong and powerful little girl,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
I think you're going to break one of those bands.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
When you do break it, I'm going to give you a hundred bucks."

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Now, of course, this was a simple ploy on Dr. P's part

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
to get me to do the exercises I didn't want to do

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
before the prospect of being the richest five-year-old in the second floor ward,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:31.000
but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
into a new and promising experience for me.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And I have to wonder today to what extent his vision

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000
and his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
shaped my own view of myself

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.000
as an inherently strong, powerful and athletic person well into the future.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
This is an example of how adults in positions of power

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
can ignite the power of a child.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
But, in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:11.000
our language isn't allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000
the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Our language hasn't caught up with the changes in our society,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
many of which have been brought about by technology.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Certainly, from a medical standpoint,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:33.000
my legs, laser surgery for vision impairment,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
titanium knees and hip replacements for aging bodies

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000
and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them --

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
not to mention social networking platforms

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
allow people to self-identify, to claim their own descriptions of themselves,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
So, perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
what has always been a truth:

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:12.000
that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
The human ability to adapt, it's an interesting thing,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000
because people have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
and I'm going to make an admission:

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
This phrase never sat right with me,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000
and I always felt uneasy trying to answer people's questions about it,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
and I think I'm starting to figure out why.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Implicit in this phrase of "overcoming adversity"

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
is the idea that success, or happiness,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
unscathed or unmarked by the experience,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
as if my successes in life have come about from an ability

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000
to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
or what other people perceive as my disability.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.000
But, in fact, we are changed. We are marked, of course, by a challenge,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
whether physically, emotionally or both.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
And I'm going to suggest that this is a good thing.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Adversity isn't an obstacle that we need to get around

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
in order to resume living our life.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
It's part of our life.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
And I tend to think of it like my shadow.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Sometimes I see a lot of it, sometimes there's very little,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
but it's always with me.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:45.000
And, certainly, I'm not trying to diminish the impact, the weight, of a person's struggle.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
There is adversity and challenge in life,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
and it's all very real and relative to every single person,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
but the question isn't whether or not you're going to meet adversity,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
but how you're going to meet it.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:05.000
So, our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
but preparing them to meet it well.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
And we do a disservice to our kids

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:19.000
when we make them feel that they're not equipped to adapt.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
There's an important difference and distinction

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000
and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not I'm disabled.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And, truthfully, the only real and consistent disability I've had to confront

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000
is the world ever thinking that I could be described by those definitions.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
In our desire to protect those we care about

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
by giving them the cold, hard truth about their medical prognosis,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
or, indeed, a prognosis on the expected quality of their life,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
we have to make sure that we don't put the first brick in a wall

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
that will actually disable someone.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
and how do we fix it, serves to be more disabling to the individual

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
than the pathology itself.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
By not treating the wholeness of a person,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
by not acknowledging their potency,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:30.000
we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:36.000
We are effectively grading someone's worth to our community.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
So we need to see through the pathology

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
and into the range of human capability.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
And, most importantly, there's a partnership

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
between those perceived deficiencies

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
and our greatest creative ability.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000
So it's not about devaluing, or negating, these more trying times

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:09.000
but instead to find those opportunities wrapped in the adversity.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
So maybe the idea I want to put out there is

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
not so much overcoming adversity

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
as it is opening ourselves up to it,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
embracing it,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
grappling with it,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
to use a wrestling term,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
maybe even dancing with it.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:39.000
And, perhaps, if we see adversity as natural, consistent and useful,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
we're less burdened by the presence of it.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
This year we celebrate the 200th birthday of Charles Darwin,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
and it was 150 years ago, when writing about evolution,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000
that Darwin illustrated, I think, a truth about the human character.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
To paraphrase: It's not the strongest of the species that survives,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
nor is it the most intelligent that survives;

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000
it is the one that is most adaptable to change.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Conflict is the genesis of creation.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
From Darwin's work, amongst others, we can recognize that

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000
the human ability to survive and flourish

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000
is driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
into transformation.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:32.000
So, again, transformation, adaptation, is our greatest human skill.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:39.000
And, perhaps, until we're tested, we don't know what we're made of.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Maybe that's what adversity gives us:

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
a sense of self, a sense of our own power.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
So, we can give ourselves a gift.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:55.000
We can re-imagine adversity as something more than just tough times.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Maybe we can see it as change.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Adversity is just change that we haven't adapted ourselves to yet.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
I think the greatest adversity that we've created for ourselves

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
is this idea of normalcy.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Now, who's normal?

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
There's no normal.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
There's common, there's typical. There's no normal,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
and would you want to meet that poor, beige person if they existed?

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
(Laughter)

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
I don't think so.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
If we can change this paradigm from one of achieving normalcy

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
to one of possibility -- or potency, to be even a little bit more dangerous --

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
we can release the power of so many more children,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:45.000
and invite them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Anthropologists tell us that the one thing

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
we as humans have always required of our community members

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
is to be of use, to be able to contribute.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
There's evidence that Neanderthals, 60,000 years ago,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:05.000
carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:11.000
and perhaps it's because the life experience of survival of these people

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
proved of value to the community.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
They didn't view these people as broken and useless;

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
they were seen as rare and valuable.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
A few years ago, I was in a food market in the town where I grew up

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
in that red zone in northeastern Pennsylvania,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
and I was standing over a bushel of tomatoes.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
It was summertime: I had shorts on.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000
I hear this guy, his voice behind me say, "Well, if it isn't Aimee Mullins."

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
And I turn around, and it's this older man. I have no idea who he is.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:47.000
And I said, "I'm sorry, sir, have we met? I don't remember meeting you."

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
He said, "Well, you wouldn't remember meeting me.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
I mean, when we met I was delivering you from your mother's womb."

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
(Laughter)

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Oh, that guy.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
And, but of course, actually, it did click.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
This man was Dr. Kean,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
a man that I had only known about through my mother's stories of that day,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:12.000
because, of course, typical fashion, I arrived late for my birthday by two weeks.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
And so my mother's prenatal physician had gone on vacation,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000
so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
And, because I was born without the fibula bones,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
and had feet turned in, and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000
he had to be the bearer -- this stranger had to be the bearer of bad news.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
He said to me, "I had to give this prognosis to your parents

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
that you would never walk,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
or any kind of life of independence,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
and you've been making liar out of me ever since."

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
(Laughter)

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:54.000
(Applause)

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
The extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
newspaper clippings throughout my whole childhood,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
whether winning a second grade spelling bee,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
marching with the Girl Scouts, you know, the Halloween parade,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000
winning my college scholarship, or any of my sports victories,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:17.000
and he was using it, and integrating it into teaching resident students,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000
med students from Hahnemann Medical School and Hershey Medical School.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
And he called this part of the course the X Factor,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
the potential of the human will.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
No prognosis can account for how powerful this could be

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000
as a determinant in the quality of someone's life.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
And Dr. Kean went on to tell me,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:47.000
he said, "In my experience, unless repeatedly told otherwise,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000
and even if given a modicum of support,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:57.000
if left to their own devices, a child will achieve."

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
See, Dr. Kean made that shift in thinking.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
He understood that there's a difference between the medical condition

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
and what someone might do with it.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
And there's been a shift in my thinking over time,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
in that, if you had asked me at 15 years old,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
if I would have traded prosthetics for flesh-and-bone legs,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
I wouldn't have hesitated for a second.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:27.000
I aspired to that kind of normalcy back then.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
But if you ask me today, I'm not so sure.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000
And it's because of the experiences I've had with them,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:41.000
not in spite of the experiences I've had with them.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
And perhaps this shift in me has happened

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000
because I've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:56.000
than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
See, all you really need is one person

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000
to show you the epiphany of your own power, and you're off.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.000
If you can hand somebody the key to their own power --

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
the human spirit is so receptive -- if you can do that

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
and open a door for someone at a crucial moment,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
you are educating them in the best sense.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000
You're teaching them to open doors for themselves.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:27.000
In fact, the exact meaning of the word "educate"

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
comes from the root word "educe."

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000
It means "to bring forth what is within,

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
to bring out potential."

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000
So again, which potential do we want to bring out?

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
There was a case study done in 1960s Britain,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000
when they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
It's called the streaming trials. We call it "tracking" here in the States.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000
It's separating students from A, B, C, D and so on.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000
And the "A students" get the tougher curriculum, the best teachers, etc.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Well, they took, over a three-month period,

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
D-level students, gave them A's,

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
told them they were "A's," told them they were bright,

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
and at the end of this three-month period,

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
they were performing at A-level.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
And, of course, the heartbreaking, flip side of this study,

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000
is that they took the "A students" and told them they were "D's."

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
And that's what happened at the end of that three-month period.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000
Those who were still around in school, besides the people who had dropped out.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:40.000
A crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped too.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
The teachers didn't know a switch had been made.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
They were simply told, "These are the 'A-students,' these are the 'D-students.'"

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000
And that's how they went about teaching them and treating them.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:20:01.000
So, I think that the only true disability is a crushed spirit,

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.000
a spirit that's been crushed doesn't have hope,

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000
it doesn't see beauty,

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:14.000
it no longer has our natural, childlike curiosity

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000
and our innate ability to imagine.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000
If instead, we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope,

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000
to see beauty in themselves and others,

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000
to be curious and imaginative,

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
then we are truly using our power well.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:39.000
When a spirit has those qualities, we are able to create new realities

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
and new ways of being.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
I'd like to leave you with a poem

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000
by a fourteenth-century Persian poet named Hafiz

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000
that my friend, Jacques Dembois told me about,

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:56.000
and the poem is called "The God Who Only Knows Four Words":

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
"Every child has known God,

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
not the God of names,

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000
not the God of don'ts,

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000
but the God who only knows four words and keeps repeating them,

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:17.000
saying, 'Come dance with me.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000
Come, dance with me. Come, dance with me.'"

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
Thank you.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:35.000
(Applause)
