00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
If you'd like to learn how to play the lobster, we have some here.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
And that's not a joke, we really do.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
So come up afterwards and I'll show you how to play a lobster.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So, actually, I started working on what's called the mantis shrimp

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
a few years ago because they make sound.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
This is a recording I made of a mantis shrimp

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
that's found off the coast of California.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And while that's an absolutely fascinating sound,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
it actually turns out to be a very difficult project.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And while I was struggling to figure out how and why mantis shrimp,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
or stomatopods, make sound, I started to think about their appendages.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And mantis shrimp are called "mantis shrimp" after the praying mantises,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
which also have a fast feeding appendage. And I started to think,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
well, maybe it will be interesting, while listening to their sounds,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
to figure out how these animals generate very fast feeding strikes.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And so today I'll talk about the extreme stomatopod strike,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
work that I've done in collaboration with Wyatt Korff and Roy Caldwell.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So, mantis shrimp come in two varieties:

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
there are spearers and smashers.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And this is a spearing mantis shrimp, or stomatopod.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And he lives in the sand, and he catches things that go by overhead.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So, a quick strike like that. And if we slow it down a bit,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
this is the mantis shrimp -- the same species --

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
recorded at 1,000 frames a second,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
played back at 15 frames per second.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And you can see it's just a really spectacular extension of the limbs,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
exploding upward to actually just catch

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
a dead piece of shrimp that I had offered it.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Now, the other type of mantis shrimp is the smasher stomatopod,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and these guys open up snails for a living.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And so this guy gets the snail all set up and gives it a good whack.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
(Laughter)

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
So, I'll play it one more time.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
He wiggles it in place, tugs it with his nose, and smash.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And a few smashes later, the snail is broken open, and he's got a good dinner.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
So, the smasher raptorial appendage can stab with a point at the end,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
or it can smash with the heel.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And today I'll talk about the smashing type of strike.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And so the first question that came to mind was,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
well, how fast does this limb move?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Because it's moving pretty darn fast on that video.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And I immediately came upon a problem.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Every single high-speed video system in the biology department

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
at Berkeley wasn't fast enough to catch this movement.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
We simply couldn't capture it on video.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And so this had me stymied for quite a long period of time.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And then a BBC crew came cruising through the biology department,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
looking for a story to do about new technologies in biology.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And so we struck up a deal.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
I said, "Well, if you guys rent the high-speed video system

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
that could capture these movements,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
you guys can film us collecting the data."

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And believe it or not, they went for it. (Laughter)

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
So we got this incredible video system. It's very new technology --

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
it just came out about a year ago --

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
that allows you to film at extremely high speeds in low light.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And low light is a critical issue with filming animals,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
because if it's too high, you fry them. (Laughter)

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
So this is a mantis shrimp. There are the eyes up here,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
and there's that raptorial appendage, and there's the heel.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And that thing's going to swing around and smash the snail.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And the snail's wired to a stick,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
so he's a little bit easier to set up the shot. And -- yeah.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
(Laughter)

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
I hope there aren't any snail rights activists around here.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
(Laughter)

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
So this was filmed at 5,000 frames per second,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and I'm playing it back at 15. And so this is slowed down 333 times.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
And as you'll notice, it's still pretty gosh darn fast

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
slowed down 333 times. It's an incredibly powerful movement.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
The whole limb extends out. The body flexes backwards --

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
just a spectacular movement.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And so what we did is, we took a look at these videos,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
and we measured how fast the limb was moving

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
to get back to that original question.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And we were in for our first surprise.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
So what we calculated was that the limbs were moving

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
at the peak speed ranging from 10 meters per second

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
all the way up to 23 meters per second.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And for those of you who prefer miles per hour,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
that's over 45 miles per hour in water. And this is really darn fast.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
In fact, it's so fast we were able to add a new point

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
on the extreme animal movement spectrum.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And mantis shrimp are officially the fastest measured feeding strike

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
of any animal system. So our first surprise.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000
(Applause)

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
So that was really cool and very unexpected.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
So, you might be wondering, well, how do they do it?

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
And actually, this work was done in the 1960s

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
by a famous biologist named Malcolm Burrows.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
And what he showed in mantis shrimp is that they use

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
what's called a "catch mechanism," or "click mechanism."

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And what this basically consists of is a large muscle

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
that takes a good long time to contract,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
and a latch that prevents anything from moving.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
So the muscle contracts, and nothing happens.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
And once the muscle's contracted completely, everything's stored up --

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
the latch flies upward, and you've got the movement.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
And that's basically what's called a "power amplification system."

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
It takes a long time for the muscle to contract,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
and a very short time for the limb to fly out.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
And so I thought that this was sort of the end of the story.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
This was how mantis shrimps make these very fast strikes.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.000
But then I took a trip to the National Museum of Natural History.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And if any of you ever have a chance,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
backstage of the National Museum of Natural History

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
is one of the world's best collections of preserved mantis shrimp. And what --

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000
(Laughter)

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
this is serious business for me.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000
(Laughter)

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000
So, this -- what I saw, on every single mantis shrimp limb,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
whether it's a spearer or a smasher,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
is a beautiful saddle-shaped structure

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
right on the top surface of the limb. And you can see it right here.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
It just looks like a saddle you'd put on a horse.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
It's a very beautiful structure.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
And it's surrounded by membranous areas. And those membranous areas

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
suggested to me that maybe this is some kind of dynamically flexible structure.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And this really sort of had me scratching my head for a while.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
And then we did a series of calculations, and what we were able to show

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
is that these mantis shrimp have to have a spring.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
There needs to be some kind of spring-loaded mechanism

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
in order to generate the amount of force that we observe,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
and the speed that we observe, and the output of the system.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
So we thought, OK, this must be a spring --

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
the saddle could very well be a spring.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
And we went back to those high-speed videos again,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and we could actually visualize the saddle compressing and extending.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
And I'll just do that one more time.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
And then if you take a look at the video --

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
it's a little bit hard to see -- it's outlined in yellow.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
The saddle is outlined in yellow. You can actually see it

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
extending over the course of the strike, and actually hyperextending.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
So, we've had very solid evidence showing

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
that that saddle-shaped structure actually compresses and extends,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
and does, in fact, function as a spring.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
The saddle-shaped structure is also known as a "hyperbolic paraboloid surface,"

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
or an "anticlastic surface."

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
And this is very well known to engineers and architects,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
because it's a very strong surface in compression.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
It has curves in two directions,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
one curve upward and opposite transverse curve down the other,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
so any kind of perturbation spreads the forces

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
over the surface of this type of shape.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
So it's very well known to engineers, not as well known to biologists.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
It's also known to quite a few people who make jewelry,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
because it requires very little material

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
to build this type of surface, and it's very strong.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
So if you're going to build a thin gold structure,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
it's very nice to have it in a shape that's strong.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Now, it's also known to architects. One of the most famous architects

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
is Eduardo Catalano, who popularized this structure.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
And what's shown here is a saddle-shaped roof that he built

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
that's 87 and a half feet spanwise.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
It's two and a half inches thick, and supported at two points.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
And one of the reasons why he designed roofs this way is because it's --

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
he found it fascinating that you could build such a strong structure

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
that's made of so few materials and can be supported by so few points.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
And all of these are the same principles that apply

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
to the saddle-shaped spring in stomatopods.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
In biological systems it's important not to have a whole lot

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
of extra material requirements for building it.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
So, very interesting parallels between the biological

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
and the engineering worlds. And interestingly, this turns out --

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
the stomatopod saddle turns out to be the first

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
described biological hyperbolic paraboloid spring.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
That's a bit long, but it is sort of interesting.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
So the next and final question was, well, how much force

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
does a mantis shrimp produce if they're able to break open snails?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
And so I wired up what's called a load cell.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
A load cell measures forces, and this is actually

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
a piezoelectronic load cell that has a little crystal in it.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And when this crystal is squeezed, the electrical properties change

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
and it -- which -- in proportion to the forces that go in.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
So these animals are wonderfully aggressive,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
and are really hungry all the time. And so all I had to do

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
was actually put a little shrimp paste on the front of the load cell,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
and they'd smash away at it.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
And so this is just a regular video of the animal

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
just smashing the heck out of this load cell.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
And we were able to get some force measurements out.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And again, we were in for a surprise.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
I purchased a 100-pound load cell, thinking,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
no animal could produce more than 100 pounds at this size of an animal.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And what do you know? They immediately overloaded the load cell.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
So these are actually some old data

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
where I had to find the smallest animals in the lab,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
and we were able to measure forces of well over 100 pounds

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
generated by an animal about this big.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
And actually, just last week I got a 300-pound load cell

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
up and running, and I've clocked these animals generating

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
well over 200 pounds of force.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
And again, I think this will be a world record.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
I have to do a little bit more background reading,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
but I think this will be the largest amount of force produced

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
by an animal of a given -- per body mass. So, really incredible forces.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
And again, that brings us back to the importance of that spring

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
in storing up and releasing so much energy in this system.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
But that was not the end of the story.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Now, things -- I'm making this sound very easy, this is actually a lot of work.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
And I got all these force measurements,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
and then I went and looked at the force output of the system.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
And this is just very simple -- time is on the X-axis

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
and the force is on the Y-axis. And you can see two peaks.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
And that was what really got me puzzled.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
The first peak, obviously, is the limb hitting the load cell.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.000
But there's a really large second peak half a millisecond later,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
and I didn't know what that was.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
So now, you'd expect a second peak for other reasons,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
but not half a millisecond later.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Again, going back to those high-speed videos,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
there's a pretty good hint of what might be going on.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Here's that same orientation that we saw earlier.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
There's that raptorial appendage -- there's the heel,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
and it's going to swing around and hit the load cell.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
And what I'd like you to do in this shot is keep your eye on this,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000
on the surface of the load cell, as the limb comes flying through.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
And I hope what you are able to see is actually a flash of light.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Audience: Wow.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Sheila Patek: And so if we just take that one frame, what you can actually see there

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
at the end of that yellow arrow is a vapor bubble.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
And what that is, is cavitation.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
And cavitation is an extremely potent fluid dynamic phenomenon

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
which occurs when you have areas of water

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
moving at extremely different speeds.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000
And when this happens, it can cause areas of very low pressure,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
which results in the water literally vaporizing.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
And when that vapor bubble collapses, it emits sound, light and heat,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
and it's a very destructive process.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
And so here it is in the stomatopod. And again, this is a situation

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
where engineers are very familiar with this phenomenon,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
because it destroys boat propellers.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
People have been struggling for years to try and design

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
a very fast rotating boat propeller that doesn't cavitate

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
and literally wear away the metal and put holes in it,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
just like these pictures show.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:16.000
So this is a potent force in fluid systems, and just to sort of take it one step further,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
I'm going to show you the mantis shrimp approaching the snail.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
This is taken at 20,000 frames per second, and I have to give

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
full credit to the BBC cameraman, Tim Green, for setting this shot up,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
because I could never have done this in a million years --

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
one of the benefits of working with professional cameramen.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
You can see it coming in, and an incredible flash of light,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
and all this cavitation spreading over the surface of the snail.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
So really, just an amazing image,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
slowed down extremely, to extremely slow speeds.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
And again, we can see it in slightly different form there,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
with the bubble forming and collapsing between those two surfaces.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.000
In fact, you might have even seen some cavitation going up the edge of the limb.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
So to solve this quandary of the two force peaks:

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
what I think was going on is: that first impact is actually

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
the limb hitting the load cell, and the second impact is actually

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
the collapse of the cavitation bubble.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
And these animals may very well be making use of

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
not only the force and the energy stored with that specialized spring,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
but the extremes of the fluid dynamics. And they might actually be

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
making use of fluid dynamics as a second force for breaking the snail.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:31.000
So, really fascinating double whammy, so to speak, from these animals.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
So, one question I often get after this talk --

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
so I figured I'd answer it now -- is, well, what happens to the animal?

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Because obviously, if it's breaking snails,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
the poor limb must be disintegrating. And indeed it does.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
That's the smashing part of the heel on both these images,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
and it gets worn away. In fact, I've seen them wear away

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
their heel all the way to the flesh.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
But one of the convenient things about being an arthropod

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
is that you have to molt. And every three months or so

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
these animals molt, and they build a new limb and it's no problem.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Very, very convenient solution to that particular problem.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000
So, I'd like to end on sort of a wacky note.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
(Laughter)

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Maybe this is all wacky to folks like you, I don't know.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000
(Laughter)

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
So, the saddles -- that saddle-shaped spring --

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
has actually been well known to biologists for a long time,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
not as a spring but as a visual signal.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
And there's actually a spectacular colored dot

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:36.000
in the center of the saddles of many species of stomatopods.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
And this is quite interesting, to find evolutionary origins

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:45.000
of visual signals on what's really, in all species, their spring.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
And I think one explanation for this could be

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
going back to the molting phenomenon.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
So these animals go into a molting period where they're

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
unable to strike -- their bodies become very soft.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
And they're literally unable to strike or they will self-destruct.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:05.000
This is for real. And what they do is, up until that time period

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
when they can't strike, they become really obnoxious and awful,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
and they strike everything in sight; it doesn't matter who or what.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
And the second they get into that time point when they can't strike any more,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
they just signal. They wave their legs around.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
And it's one of the classic examples in animal behavior of bluffing.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
It's a well-established fact of these animals

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
that they actually bluff. They can't actually strike, but they pretend to.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
And so I'm very curious about whether those colored dots

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000
in the center of the saddles are conveying some kind of information

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
about their ability to strike, or their strike force,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
and something about the time period in the molting cycle.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
So sort of an interesting strange fact to find a visual structure

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
right in the middle of their spring.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
So to conclude, I mostly want to acknowledge my two collaborators,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Wyatt Korff and Roy Caldwell, who worked closely with me on this.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
And also the Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
which gave me three years of funding to just do science all the time,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
and for that I'm very grateful. Thank you very much.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000
(Applause)
