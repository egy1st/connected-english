WEBVTT

00:00:01.013 --> 00:00:03.551
I want to talk about my investigations

00:00:03.575 --> 00:00:08.119
into what technology means in our lives --

00:00:08.143 --> 00:00:11.351
not just our immediate life,
but in the cosmic sense,

00:00:11.375 --> 00:00:14.517
in the kind of long history of the world

00:00:14.541 --> 00:00:17.120
and our place in the world.

00:00:17.144 --> 00:00:19.018
What is this stuff?

00:00:19.042 --> 00:00:20.502
What is the significance?

00:00:20.526 --> 00:00:24.434
And so, I want to kind of
go through my little story

00:00:24.458 --> 00:00:25.704
of what I found out.

00:00:25.728 --> 00:00:28.015
One of the first things
I started to investigate

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:30.850
was the history of the name of technology.

00:00:30.874 --> 00:00:33.828
In the United States,
there is a State of the Union address

00:00:33.852 --> 00:00:36.747
given by every president since 1790.

00:00:36.771 --> 00:00:41.809
And each one of those is kind of
summing up the most important things

00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:43.539
for the United States at that time.

00:00:43.563 --> 00:00:48.849
If you search for the word "technology,"
it was not used until 1952.

00:00:48.873 --> 00:00:52.971
So, technology was sort of absent
from everybody's thinking until 1952,

00:00:52.995 --> 00:00:55.046
which happened to be the year of my birth.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.063
And obviously, technology
had existed before then,

00:00:58.087 --> 00:00:59.492
but we weren't aware of it.

00:00:59.516 --> 00:01:04.114
And so it was sort of an awakening
of this force in our life.

00:01:04.138 --> 00:01:08.351
I actually did research to find out
the first use of the word "technology."

00:01:08.375 --> 00:01:10.351
It was in 1829,

00:01:10.375 --> 00:01:13.351
and it was invented by a guy
who was starting a curriculum --

00:01:13.375 --> 00:01:18.001
a course, bringing together all the kinds
of arts and crafts, and industry --

00:01:18.025 --> 00:01:19.986
and he called it "Technology."

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.493
And that's the very first use of the word.

00:01:22.517 --> 00:01:24.683
So what is this stuff

00:01:24.707 --> 00:01:28.507
that we're all consumed by
and bothered by?

00:01:30.018 --> 00:01:32.940
Alan Kay calls it, "Technology
is anything that was invented

00:01:32.964 --> 00:01:34.193
after you were born."

00:01:34.217 --> 00:01:35.225
(Laughter)

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:39.684
Which is sort of the idea we normally
have about what technology is:

00:01:39.708 --> 00:01:41.351
it's all that new stuff.

00:01:41.375 --> 00:01:43.578
It's not roads, or penicillin,

00:01:43.602 --> 00:01:47.365
or factory tires; it's the new stuff.

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:49.912
My friend Danny Hillis
says kind of a similar one,

00:01:49.936 --> 00:01:52.615
he says, "Technology is anything
that doesn't work yet."

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:53.654
(Laughter)

00:01:53.678 --> 00:01:55.718
Which is, again,
a sense that it's all new.

00:01:55.742 --> 00:01:57.450
But we know that it's just not new.

00:01:57.474 --> 00:01:58.760
It actually goes way back,

00:01:58.784 --> 00:02:02.885
and what I want to suggest is,
it goes a long way back.

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.677
So, another way to think
about technology, what it means,

00:02:05.701 --> 00:02:07.725
is to imagine a world without technology.

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:11.410
If we were to eliminate every single bit
of technology in the world today --

00:02:11.434 --> 00:02:16.351
and I mean everything,
from blades to scrapers to cloth --

00:02:16.375 --> 00:02:19.110
we, as a species,
would not live very long.

00:02:19.134 --> 00:02:22.111
We would die by the billions,
and very quickly:

00:02:22.135 --> 00:02:25.440
the wolves would get us,
we would be defenseless,

00:02:25.464 --> 00:02:28.657
we would be unable to grow
enough food or find enough food.

00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:32.117
Even the hunter-gatherers
used some elementary tools.

00:02:32.141 --> 00:02:34.473
So, they had minimal technology,

00:02:34.497 --> 00:02:36.179
but they had some technology.

00:02:36.203 --> 00:02:39.336
And if we study
those hunter-gatherer tribes

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.012
and the Neanderthal,
which are very similar to early man,

00:02:43.036 --> 00:02:46.323
we find out a very curious thing
about this world without technology,

00:02:46.347 --> 00:02:49.176
and this is a kind of a curve
of their average age.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.655
There are no Neanderthal fossils
that are older than 40 years old

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:55.290
that we've ever found,

00:02:55.314 --> 00:02:59.544
and the average age of most of these
hunter-gatherer tribes is 20 to 30.

00:02:59.568 --> 00:03:04.469
There are very few young infants,
because they die -- high mortality rate --

00:03:04.493 --> 00:03:06.041
and there's very few old people.

00:03:06.065 --> 00:03:09.645
So the profile is sort of for your average
San Francisco neighborhood:

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:11.074
a lot of young people.

00:03:11.098 --> 00:03:14.162
And if you go there, you say,
"Hey, everybody's really healthy."

00:03:14.186 --> 00:03:16.090
Well, that's because they're all young.

00:03:16.114 --> 00:03:18.845
Same thing with the hunter-gatherer
tribes and early man:

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:20.664
you didn't live beyond the age of 30.

00:03:20.688 --> 00:03:22.665
So it was a world without grandparents.

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:24.722
And grandparents are very important,

00:03:24.746 --> 00:03:28.385
because they are the transmitter
of cultural evolution and information.

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:31.545
Imagine a world where basically
everybody was 20 to 30 years old.

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:33.213
How much learning can you do?

00:03:33.237 --> 00:03:35.572
You can't do very much
learning in your own life,

00:03:35.596 --> 00:03:36.894
it's so short,

00:03:36.918 --> 00:03:39.272
and there's nobody to pass on
what you do learn.

00:03:39.296 --> 00:03:42.243
So that's one aspect.

00:03:42.267 --> 00:03:43.583
It was a very short life.

00:03:43.607 --> 00:03:46.399
But at the same time, anthropologists know

00:03:46.423 --> 00:03:49.003
that most hunter-gatherer
tribes of the world,

00:03:49.027 --> 00:03:50.689
with that very little technology,

00:03:50.713 --> 00:03:54.199
actually did not spend a very long time
gathering the food they needed:

00:03:54.223 --> 00:03:55.806
three to six hours a day.

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.851
Some anthropologists call that
the original affluent society,

00:03:59.875 --> 00:04:02.241
because they had
bankers' hours, basically.

00:04:02.265 --> 00:04:04.899
So it was possible to get enough food.

00:04:04.923 --> 00:04:07.424
But when the scarcity came,

00:04:07.448 --> 00:04:09.731
when the highs and lows
and the droughts came,

00:04:09.755 --> 00:04:12.288
then people went into starvation.

00:04:12.312 --> 00:04:14.360
And that's why they didn't live very long.

00:04:14.384 --> 00:04:16.799
So what technology brought,

00:04:16.823 --> 00:04:20.272
through the very simple tools
like these stone tools here --

00:04:21.423 --> 00:04:23.236
even something as small as this --

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.665
the early bands of humans were actually
able to eliminate to extinction

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:33.781
about 250 megafauna animals
in North America

00:04:33.805 --> 00:04:35.994
when they first arrived 10,000 years ago.

00:04:36.018 --> 00:04:38.659
So, long before the industrial age,

00:04:38.683 --> 00:04:41.351
we've been affecting
the planet on a global scale

00:04:41.375 --> 00:04:43.506
with just a small amount of technology.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.826
The other thing that the early man
invented was fire.

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.975
And fire was used to clear out, and again,

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:52.647
affected the ecology of grass
and whole continents,

00:04:52.671 --> 00:04:55.069
and was used in cooking.

00:04:55.093 --> 00:04:57.548
It enabled us to actually
eat all kinds of things.

00:04:57.572 --> 00:04:59.826
It was, in a certain sense,
in a McLuhan sense,

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.958
an external stomach,

00:05:01.982 --> 00:05:05.477
in the sense that it was cooking food
that we could not eat otherwise.

00:05:05.501 --> 00:05:08.245
And if we didn't have fire,
we actually could not live.

00:05:08.269 --> 00:05:11.411
Our bodies have adapted
to these new diets.

00:05:11.435 --> 00:05:14.230
Our bodies have changed
in the last 10,000 years.

00:05:14.254 --> 00:05:17.310
So, with that little bit of technology,

00:05:17.334 --> 00:05:19.610
humans went from a small band
of 10,000 or so --

00:05:19.634 --> 00:05:21.783
the same number
as Neanderthals everywhere --

00:05:21.807 --> 00:05:23.045
and we suddenly exploded.

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:25.670
With the invention of language
around 50,000 years ago,

00:05:25.694 --> 00:05:27.187
the number of humans exploded,

00:05:27.211 --> 00:05:30.335
and very quickly became
the dominant species on the planet.

00:05:30.359 --> 00:05:32.801
And they migrated
into the rest of the world

00:05:32.825 --> 00:05:34.265
at two kilometers per year

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:37.266
until, within several tens
of thousands of years,

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.565
we occupied every single
watershed on the planet

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:41.407
and became the most dominant species,

00:05:41.431 --> 00:05:43.794
with a very small amount of technology.

00:05:43.818 --> 00:05:46.898
And even at that time,
with the introduction of agriculture,

00:05:46.922 --> 00:05:48.632
8,000, 10,000 years ago,

00:05:48.656 --> 00:05:50.351
we started to see climate change.

00:05:50.375 --> 00:05:53.959
So climate change is not a new thing;
what's new is just the degree of it.

00:05:53.983 --> 00:05:57.058
Even during the agricultural age,
there was climate change.

00:05:57.082 --> 00:06:00.818
So already, small amounts of technology
were transforming the world.

00:06:00.842 --> 00:06:03.503
And what this means, and where I'm going,

00:06:03.527 --> 00:06:07.351
is that technology has become
the most powerful force in the world.

00:06:07.375 --> 00:06:10.302
All the things we see today
that are changing our lives,

00:06:10.326 --> 00:06:11.513
we can always trace back

00:06:11.537 --> 00:06:13.602
to the introduction
of some new technology.

00:06:13.626 --> 00:06:14.931
So it's a force,

00:06:14.955 --> 00:06:19.026
that is the most powerful force
that has been unleashed on this planet,

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.859
and in such a degree,

00:06:20.883 --> 00:06:27.104
that I think it's become who we are.

00:06:27.128 --> 00:06:30.383
In fact, our humanity and everything
that we think about ourselves,

00:06:30.407 --> 00:06:31.875
is something we've invented.

00:06:31.899 --> 00:06:33.306
So we've invented ourselves.

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:35.448
Of all the animals
that we've domesticated,

00:06:35.472 --> 00:06:37.587
the most important animal has been us.

00:06:38.833 --> 00:06:42.351
So humanity is our greatest invention,

00:06:42.375 --> 00:06:44.351
but of course, we're not done yet.

00:06:44.375 --> 00:06:45.537
We're still inventing,

00:06:45.561 --> 00:06:47.899
and this is what technology
is allowing us to do;

00:06:47.923 --> 00:06:49.959
it's continually to reinvent ourselves.

00:06:49.983 --> 00:06:52.406
It's a very, very strong force.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.565
I call this entire thing --
us humans as our technology,

00:06:55.589 --> 00:06:58.351
everything that we've made,
gadgets in our lives --

00:06:58.375 --> 00:06:59.638
we call that the technium.

00:06:59.662 --> 00:07:00.822
That's this world.

00:07:00.846 --> 00:07:02.751
My working definition of technology is:

00:07:02.775 --> 00:07:05.148
anything useful that a human mind makes.

00:07:05.172 --> 00:07:07.830
It's not just hammers
and gadgets, like laptops.

00:07:07.854 --> 00:07:09.275
But it's also law.

00:07:09.299 --> 00:07:14.442
And, of course, cities are ways
to make things more useful to us.

00:07:14.466 --> 00:07:16.931
While this is something
that comes from our mind,

00:07:16.955 --> 00:07:21.248
it also has its roots
deeply into the cosmos.

00:07:21.272 --> 00:07:22.435
It goes back.

00:07:22.459 --> 00:07:25.322
The origins and roots of technology
go back to the Big Bang,

00:07:25.346 --> 00:07:29.834
in this way, in that they are part
of this self-organizing thread

00:07:29.858 --> 00:07:34.413
that starts at the Big Bang
and goes through galaxies and stars,

00:07:34.437 --> 00:07:35.995
into life, into us.

00:07:36.019 --> 00:07:38.647
And the three major phases
of the early universe

00:07:38.671 --> 00:07:40.893
was energy, when the dominant
force was energy;

00:07:40.917 --> 00:07:43.957
then the dominant force,
as it cooled, became matter;

00:07:43.981 --> 00:07:47.351
and then, with the invention
of life four billion years ago,

00:07:47.375 --> 00:07:50.161
the dominant force in our neighborhood
became information.

00:07:50.185 --> 00:07:51.369
That's what life is:

00:07:51.393 --> 00:07:53.553
an information process
that was restructuring

00:07:53.577 --> 00:07:54.799
and making new order.

00:07:54.823 --> 00:07:58.440
So, energy and matter,
Einstein showed were equivalent,

00:07:58.464 --> 00:08:04.084
and now new sciences of quantum computing
show that entropy and information

00:08:04.108 --> 00:08:05.558
and matter and energy

00:08:05.582 --> 00:08:06.746
are all interrelated.

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:08.307
So it's one long continuum.

00:08:09.204 --> 00:08:12.399
You put energy
into the right kind of system,

00:08:12.423 --> 00:08:15.497
and out comes wasted heat, entropy,

00:08:15.521 --> 00:08:18.351
and extropy, which is order.

00:08:18.375 --> 00:08:19.705
It's the increased order.

00:08:19.729 --> 00:08:21.282
Where does this order come from?

00:08:21.306 --> 00:08:22.577
Its roots go way back.

00:08:22.601 --> 00:08:23.934
We actually don't know.

00:08:23.958 --> 00:08:25.170
But we do know

00:08:25.194 --> 00:08:29.489
that the self-organization trend
throughout the universe is long,

00:08:29.513 --> 00:08:31.736
and it began with things like galaxies;

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:34.254
they maintained their order
for billions of years.

00:08:34.278 --> 00:08:38.128
Stars are basically
nuclear fission machines

00:08:38.152 --> 00:08:41.451
that self-organize and self-sustain
themselves for billions of years:

00:08:41.475 --> 00:08:43.606
order against the extropy of the world.

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:48.540
And flowers and plants
are the same thing, extended,

00:08:48.564 --> 00:08:53.311
and technology is basically
an extension of life.

00:08:54.223 --> 00:08:57.201
One trend that we notice
in all those things

00:08:57.225 --> 00:08:59.797
is that the amount of energy
per gram per second

00:08:59.821 --> 00:09:01.104
that flows through this

00:09:01.128 --> 00:09:02.419
is actually increasing.

00:09:02.443 --> 00:09:07.022
The amount of energy is increasing
through this little sequence.

00:09:07.046 --> 00:09:11.023
And the amount of energy per gram
per second that flows through life

00:09:11.047 --> 00:09:13.024
is actually greater than a star --

00:09:13.048 --> 00:09:16.351
because of the star's long lifespan,

00:09:16.375 --> 00:09:19.564
the energy density in life
is actually higher than a star.

00:09:19.588 --> 00:09:22.447
And the energy density
that we see in the greatest amount

00:09:22.471 --> 00:09:23.677
anywhere in the universe

00:09:23.701 --> 00:09:25.034
is actually in a PC chip.

00:09:25.058 --> 00:09:28.208
There is more energy flowing
through, per gram per second,

00:09:28.232 --> 00:09:31.350
than anything that we have
any other experience with.

00:09:31.374 --> 00:09:33.003
And so, what I would suggest

00:09:33.027 --> 00:09:35.968
is that if you want to see
where technology is going,

00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:37.624
we continue that trajectory,

00:09:37.648 --> 00:09:40.501
and we say, "Well, it's going
to become more energy-dense,

00:09:40.525 --> 00:09:41.742
that's where it's going."

00:09:41.766 --> 00:09:44.734
And so what I've done is,
I've taken the same kinds of things

00:09:44.758 --> 00:09:48.024
and looked at other aspects
of evolutionary life and say,

00:09:48.048 --> 00:09:50.654
"What are the general trends
in evolutionary life?"

00:09:50.678 --> 00:09:53.400
And there are things moving
towards greater complexity,

00:09:53.424 --> 00:09:57.351
moving towards greater diversity,
moving towards greater specialization,

00:09:57.375 --> 00:10:01.617
sentience, ubiquity,
and most important, evolvability.

00:10:01.641 --> 00:10:05.164
Those very same things
are also present in technology.

00:10:05.188 --> 00:10:07.037
That's where technology is going.

00:10:07.061 --> 00:10:11.504
In fact, technology
is accelerating all the aspects of life.

00:10:12.375 --> 00:10:13.873
And we can see that happening;

00:10:13.897 --> 00:10:18.048
just as there's diversity in life,
there's more diversity in things we make.

00:10:18.072 --> 00:10:20.222
Things in life start off
being general cells,

00:10:20.246 --> 00:10:21.627
and they become specialized:

00:10:21.651 --> 00:10:23.788
you have tissue cells,
muscle, brain cells.

00:10:23.812 --> 00:10:25.842
The same thing happens
with, say, a hammer,

00:10:25.866 --> 00:10:28.351
which is general at first
and becomes more specific.

00:10:28.375 --> 00:10:31.471
So I would like to say
that while there are six kingdoms of life,

00:10:31.495 --> 00:10:35.076
we can think of technology
basically as a seventh kingdom of life.

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.431
It's a branching off from the human form.

00:10:37.455 --> 00:10:41.351
But technology has its own agenda,
like anything, like life itself.

00:10:41.375 --> 00:10:44.517
For instance, right now,
three-quarters of the energy that we use

00:10:44.541 --> 00:10:46.673
is actually used to feed
the technium itself.

00:10:46.697 --> 00:10:48.589
In transportation, it's not to move us;

00:10:48.613 --> 00:10:50.482
it's to move the stuff we make or buy.

00:10:50.506 --> 00:10:52.483
I use the word "want." Technology wants.

00:10:52.507 --> 00:10:55.509
This is a robot that wants to plug
itself in to get more power.

00:10:55.533 --> 00:10:58.112
Your cat wants more food.

00:10:58.136 --> 00:11:00.699
A bacterium, which has
no consciousness at all,

00:11:00.723 --> 00:11:02.351
wants to move towards light.

00:11:02.375 --> 00:11:05.063
It has an urge,
and technology has an urge.

00:11:05.087 --> 00:11:07.231
At the same time,
it wants to give us things,

00:11:07.255 --> 00:11:09.809
and what it gives us
is basically progress.

00:11:09.833 --> 00:11:12.905
You can take all kinds of curves,
and they're all pointing up.

00:11:12.929 --> 00:11:15.351
There's really no dispute about progress,

00:11:15.375 --> 00:11:18.351
if we discount the cost of that.

00:11:18.375 --> 00:11:20.566
And that's the thing
that bothers most people,

00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:24.454
is that progress is really real,
but we wonder and question:

00:11:24.478 --> 00:11:26.351
What are the environmental costs of it?

00:11:26.375 --> 00:11:30.202
I did a survey of the number
of species of artifacts in my house,

00:11:30.226 --> 00:11:31.384
and there's 6,000.

00:11:31.408 --> 00:11:33.477
Other people have come up with 10,000.

00:11:33.501 --> 00:11:35.941
When King Henry of England died,

00:11:35.965 --> 00:11:38.019
he had 18,000 things in his house,

00:11:38.043 --> 00:11:41.520
but that was the entire
wealth of England, so ...

00:11:41.544 --> 00:11:42.754
(Laughter)

00:11:42.778 --> 00:11:45.284
And with that entire wealth of England,

00:11:45.308 --> 00:11:48.234
King Henry could not buy any antibiotics,

00:11:48.258 --> 00:11:49.808
he could not buy refrigeration,

00:11:49.832 --> 00:11:51.965
he could not buy
a trip of a thousand miles,

00:11:51.989 --> 00:11:56.453
whereas this rickshaw wallah in India
could save up and buy antibiotics

00:11:56.477 --> 00:11:58.220
and he could buy refrigeration.

00:11:58.244 --> 00:12:01.715
He could buy things that King Henry,
in all his wealth, could never buy.

00:12:01.739 --> 00:12:03.406
That's what progress is about.

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:06.351
So, technology is selfish;
technology is generous.

00:12:06.375 --> 00:12:09.571
That conflict, that tension,
will be with us forever:

00:12:09.595 --> 00:12:11.793
sometimes it wants to do
what it wants to do,

00:12:11.817 --> 00:12:13.937
and sometimes it's going
to do things for us.

00:12:13.961 --> 00:12:16.028
We have confusion
about what we should think

00:12:16.052 --> 00:12:17.351
about a new technology.

00:12:17.375 --> 00:12:21.205
Right now the default position
when a new technology comes along,

00:12:21.229 --> 00:12:23.554
is people talk about
the precautionary principle,

00:12:23.578 --> 00:12:25.464
which is very common in Europe,

00:12:25.488 --> 00:12:27.535
which says, basically, "Don't do anything.

00:12:27.559 --> 00:12:30.173
When you meet a new technology, stop,

00:12:30.197 --> 00:12:32.726
until it can be proven
that it does no harm."

00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:34.995
I think that really leads nowhere.

00:12:35.019 --> 00:12:38.020
But a better way is
what I call the proactionary principle,

00:12:38.044 --> 00:12:40.450
which is, you engage with technology.

00:12:40.474 --> 00:12:41.852
You try it out.

00:12:41.876 --> 00:12:46.092
You obviously do what the precautionary
principle suggests,

00:12:46.116 --> 00:12:47.361
you try to anticipate it,

00:12:47.385 --> 00:12:48.812
but after anticipating it,

00:12:48.836 --> 00:12:50.351
you constantly asses it,

00:12:50.375 --> 00:12:51.938
not just once, but eternally.

00:12:51.962 --> 00:12:55.139
And when it diverts from what you want,

00:12:55.163 --> 00:12:58.324
we prioritize risk,
we evaluate not just the new stuff,

00:12:58.348 --> 00:12:59.507
but the old stuff.

00:12:59.531 --> 00:13:01.401
We fix it; but most importantly,

00:13:01.425 --> 00:13:02.582
we relocate it.

00:13:02.606 --> 00:13:04.430
And what I mean by that is,

00:13:04.454 --> 00:13:06.162
we find a new job for it.

00:13:06.186 --> 00:13:10.196
Nuclear energy, fission,
is a really bad idea for bombs.

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:15.615
But it may be a pretty good idea
relocated into sustainable nuclear energy

00:13:15.639 --> 00:13:17.957
for electricity, instead of burning coal.

00:13:17.981 --> 00:13:19.696
When we have a bad idea,

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.284
the response to a bad idea

00:13:21.308 --> 00:13:24.628
is not no ideas,
it's not to stop thinking.

00:13:24.652 --> 00:13:26.805
The response to a bad idea --

00:13:26.829 --> 00:13:28.957
like, say, a tungsten lightbulb --

00:13:28.981 --> 00:13:31.220
is a better idea.

00:13:31.713 --> 00:13:35.193
So, better ideas
is really always the response

00:13:35.217 --> 00:13:36.582
to technology we don't like;

00:13:36.606 --> 00:13:38.693
it's basically better technology.

00:13:39.199 --> 00:13:43.019
And actually, in a certain sense,
technology is a kind of a method

00:13:43.043 --> 00:13:44.598
for generating better ideas,

00:13:44.622 --> 00:13:46.351
if you can think about it that way.

00:13:46.375 --> 00:13:49.470
So, maybe spraying DDT
on crops is a really bad idea.

00:13:49.494 --> 00:13:52.351
But DDT sprayed on local homes --

00:13:52.375 --> 00:13:55.351
there's nothing better
to eliminate malaria,

00:13:55.375 --> 00:13:59.113
besides insect DDT-impregnated
mosquito nets.

00:13:59.137 --> 00:14:02.468
But that's a really good idea;
that's a good job for technology.

00:14:02.492 --> 00:14:06.351
So our job as humans
is to parent our mind children,

00:14:06.375 --> 00:14:07.819
to find them good friends,

00:14:07.843 --> 00:14:09.235
to find them a good job.

00:14:09.259 --> 00:14:12.067
And so, every technology
is sort of a creative force

00:14:12.091 --> 00:14:14.111
looking for the right job.

00:14:14.135 --> 00:14:16.226
That's actually my son, right here.

00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:17.573
(Laughter)

00:14:17.597 --> 00:14:20.089
There are no bad technologies,

00:14:20.113 --> 00:14:21.809
just as there are no bad children.

00:14:21.833 --> 00:14:24.715
We don't say children are neutral;
children are positive.

00:14:24.739 --> 00:14:27.066
We just have to find them the right place.

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:31.044
And so, what technology gives us
over the long term --

00:14:31.068 --> 00:14:34.709
over this sort of extended evolution
from the beginning of time,

00:14:34.733 --> 00:14:38.351
through the invention
of the plants and animals,

00:14:38.375 --> 00:14:41.351
and the evolution of life,
the evolution of brains --

00:14:41.375 --> 00:14:45.286
what that is constantly giving us
is increasing differences:

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:47.765
It's increasing diversity,
it's increasing options,

00:14:47.789 --> 00:14:51.767
it's increasing choices, opportunities,
possibilities and freedoms.

00:14:51.791 --> 00:14:54.715
That's what we get
from technology all the time.

00:14:54.739 --> 00:14:57.555
That's why people leave villages
and go into cities --

00:14:57.579 --> 00:15:01.228
because they are always gravitating
towards increased choices

00:15:01.252 --> 00:15:02.489
and possibilities.

00:15:02.513 --> 00:15:05.142
And we are aware of the price;

00:15:05.166 --> 00:15:07.405
we pay a price for that,
but we're aware of it,

00:15:07.429 --> 00:15:10.384
and generally, we will pay the price
for increased freedoms,

00:15:10.408 --> 00:15:11.796
choices and opportunities.

00:15:12.305 --> 00:15:15.013
Even technology wants clean water.

00:15:15.037 --> 00:15:19.218
Is technology diametrically
opposed to nature?

00:15:19.242 --> 00:15:22.100
Because technology
is an extension of life,

00:15:22.124 --> 00:15:24.967
it's in parallel and aligned
with the same things

00:15:24.991 --> 00:15:26.294
that life wants.

00:15:26.874 --> 00:15:29.049
So that I think technology loves biology,

00:15:29.073 --> 00:15:30.624
if we allow it to.

00:15:31.231 --> 00:15:35.351
Great movement
starting billions of years ago

00:15:35.375 --> 00:15:37.679
is moving through us
and it continues to go,

00:15:37.703 --> 00:15:41.116
and our choice, so to speak,
in technology,

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:43.211
is really to align ourselves
with this force

00:15:43.235 --> 00:15:44.619
much greater than ourselves.

00:15:44.643 --> 00:15:47.451
So, technology is more
than just the stuff in your pocket;

00:15:47.475 --> 00:15:48.866
it's more than just gadgets,

00:15:48.890 --> 00:15:51.355
it's more than just things
that people invent.

00:15:51.379 --> 00:15:54.766
It's actually part of a very long
story -- a great story --

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:56.423
that began billions of years ago.

00:15:56.447 --> 00:15:58.754
It's moving through us,
this self-organization,

00:15:58.778 --> 00:16:00.755
and we're extending and accelerating it,

00:16:00.779 --> 00:16:04.543
and we can be part of it by aligning
the technology that we make with it.

00:16:04.567 --> 00:16:07.405
And I really appreciate
your attention today.

00:16:07.429 --> 00:16:08.588
Thank you.

00:16:08.612 --> 00:16:12.198
(Applause)
