00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I've always been interested in

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
the relationship of formal structures and human behavior.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
If you build a wide road out to the outskirts of town, people will move there.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Well, law is also a powerful driver

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
of human behavior.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And what I'd like to discuss today

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
is the need to overhaul and simplify the law

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
to release the energy and passion

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
of Americans, so that we can begin

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
to address the challenges of our society.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
You might have noticed that law has grown

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
progressively denser in your lives over the last decade or two.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
If you run a business, it's hard to do much of anything

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
without calling your general counsel.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Indeed, there is this phenomenon now

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
where the general counsels are becoming the CEOs.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It's a little bit like the Invasion Of The Body Snatchers.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
You need a lawyer to run the company,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
because there's so much law.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
But it's not just business that's affected by this,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
it's actually pressed down into the daily activities

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
of ordinary people.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
A couple of years ago I was hiking near Cody, Wyoming.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
It was in a grizzly bear preserve,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
although no one told me that before we went.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And our guide was a local science teacher.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
She was wholly unconcerned about the bears,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
but she was terrified of lawyers.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
The stories started pouring out.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
She'd just been involved in an episode where a parent

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
had threatened to sue the school

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
because she lowered the grade of the student by 10 percent

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
when he turned the paper in late.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
The principal didn't want to stand up to the parent

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
because he didn't want to get dragged into some legal proceedings.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
So, she had to go to meeting after meeting, same arguments made

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
over and over again.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
After 30 days of sleepless nights, she finally capitulated

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and raised the grade.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
She said, "Life's too short, I just can't keep going with this."

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
About the same time, she was going to take two students to a leadership conference

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
in Laramie, which is a couple of hours away,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and she was going to drive them in her car,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
but the school said, "No, you can't drive them in the car

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
for liability reasons.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
You have to go in a school bus."

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
So, they provided a bus that held 60 people

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and drove the three of them back and forth

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
several hours to Laramie.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Her husband is also a science teacher,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and he takes his biology class on a hike

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
in the nearby national park.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
But he was told he couldn't go on the hike this year

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
because one of the students in the class was disabled,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
so the other 25 students didn't get to go on the hike either.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
At the end of this day I could have filled a book

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
just with stories about law

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
from this one teacher.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Now, we've been taught to believe that law

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
is the foundation of freedom.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
But somehow or another, in the last couple of decades,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
the land of the free has become a legal minefield.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
It's really changed our lives in ways

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
that are sort of imperceptible;

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and yet, when you pull back, you see it all the time.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
It's changed the way we talk. I was talking to a

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
pediatrician friend

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
in North Carolina. He said,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
"Well you know, I don't deal with patients the same way anymore.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
You wouldn't want to say something off-the-cuff

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
that might be used against you."

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
This is a doctor, whose life is caring for people.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
My own law firm has a list of questions

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
that I'm not allowed to ask

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
when interviewing candidates,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
such as the sinister question,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
bulging with hidden motives and innuendo,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
"Where are you from?"

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
(Laughter)

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Now for 20 years, tort reformers have been sounding the alarm

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
that lawsuits are out of control.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And we read every once in while

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
about these crazy lawsuits, like the guy

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
in the District of Columbia who sued his dry cleaners for 54 million dollars

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
because they lost his pair of pants.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
The case went on for two years; I think he's still appealing the case.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
But the reality is, these crazy cases

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
are relatively rare. They don't usually win.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And the total of direct tort cost

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
in this country is about two percent,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
which is twice as much as in other countries

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
but, as taxes go, hardly crippling.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
But the direct costs are really only the tip of the iceberg.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
What's happened here, again,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
almost without our knowing,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
is our culture has changed.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
People no longer feel free

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
to act on their best judgment.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
So, what do we do about it?

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
We certainly don't want to give up the rights,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
when people do something wrong, to seek redress in the courts.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
We need regulation to make sure

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
people don't pollute and such.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
We lack even a vocabulary to deal with

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
this problem,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
and that's because we have the wrong frame of reference.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
We've been trained to think that the way to look at every dispute,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
every issue, is a matter of kind of individual rights.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
And so we peer through a legal microscope, and look at everything.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Is it possible that there are extenuating circumstances

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
that explain why Johnny

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
turned his paper in late in Cody, Wyoming?

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Is it possible that the doctor

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
might have done something differently when the sick person gets sicker?

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And of course the hindsight bias is perfect.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
There's always a different scenario that you can sketch out

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
where it's possible that something could have been done differently.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
And yet, we've been trained to squint into this legal microscope,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
hoping that we can judge any dispute

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
against the standard of a perfect society,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
where everyone will agree what's fair,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
and where accidents will be extinct,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
risk will be no more.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Of course, this is Utopia;

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
it's a formula for paralysis, not freedom.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
It's not the basis of the rule of law,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
it's not the basis of a free society.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
So, now I have the first of four propositions

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
I'm going to leave with you about how you simplify the law:

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
You've got to judge law mainly

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
by its effect on the broader society,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
not individual disputes.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Absolutely vital.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
So, let's pull back from the anecdotes for a second

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
and look at our society from high above.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Is it working?

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
What does the macro-data show us?

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Well, the healthcare system has been transformed:

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
a culture pervaded with defensiveness,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
universal distrust of the system of justice,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
universal practice of defensive medicine.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
It's very hard to measure

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
because there are mixed motives.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Doctors can make more on ordering tests sometimes,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
and also they no longer even know what's right or wrong.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
But reliable estimates

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
range between 60 billion and

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
200 billion dollars per year.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
That's enough to provide care to all the people

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
in America who don't have it.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
The trial lawyers say, "Well, this legal fear

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
makes doctors practice better medicine."

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Well that's been studied too, by the Institute of Medicine

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and others. Turns out that's not the case.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
The fear has chilled professional interaction

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
so thousands of tragic errors occur

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
because doctors are afraid

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
to speak up: "Are you sure that's the right dosage?"

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Because they're not sure,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
and they don't want to take legal responsibility.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Let's go to schools.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
As we saw with the teacher in Cody, Wyoming,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
she seems to be affected by the law.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Well it turns out the schools are literally drowning in law.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
You could have a separate section of a law library

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
around each of the following legal concepts:

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
due process, special education,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
no child left behind,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
zero tolerance, work rules ...

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
it goes on. We did a study

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
of all the rules that affect one school

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
in New York. The Board of Ed. had no idea.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Tens of thousands of discreet rules,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
60 steps to suspend a student from school:

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
It's a formula for paralysis.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
What's the effect of that? One is a decline in order.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Again, studies have shown

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
it's directly attributable

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
to the rise of due process.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Public agenda did a survey for us a couple of years ago

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
where they found that 43 percent of the high school teachers in America

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
say that they spend at least half of their time

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
maintaining order in the classroom.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
That means those students are getting half the learning

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
they're supposed to, because if one child is disrupting the class

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
no one can learn.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
And what happens when the teacher tries to assert order?

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
They're threatened with a legal claim.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
We also surveyed that. Seventy-eight percent of the middle and high school teachers

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
in America have been threatened by their students

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
with violating their rights, with lawsuits

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
by their students. They are threatening, their students.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
It's not that they usually sue,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
it's not that they would win, but it's an

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
indication of the corrosion of authority.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
And how has this system of law worked for government?

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
It doesn't seem to be working very well does it?

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Neither in Sacramento nor in Washington.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
The other day at the State of the Union speech,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
President Obama said,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
and I think we could all agree with this goal,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
"From the first railroads to the interstate highway system,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
our nation has always been the first to compete.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000
There is no reason Europe or China should have the fastest trains."

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Well, actually there is a reason:

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Environmental review has evolved into a process

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
of no pebble left unturned

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
for any major project taking the better part of a decade,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
then followed by years of litigation

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
by anybody who doesn't like the project.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Then, just staying above the Earth for one more second,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
people are acting like idiots,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000
(Laughter)

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
all across the country.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
(Applause)

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Idiots. A couple of years ago,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Broward County, Florida, banned running at recess.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000
(Laughter)

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
That means all the boys are going to be ADD.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
I mean it's just absolutely

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
a formula for failure.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
My favorite, though, are all the warning labels.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
"Caution: Contents are hot,"

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
on billions of coffee cups.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Archeologists will dig us up in a thousand years

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
and they won't know about defensive medicine and stuff,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
but they'll see all these labels, "Contents are extremely hot."

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
They'll think it was some kind of aphrodisiac.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
That's the only explanation. Because why

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
would you have to tell people that something was actually hot?

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
My favorite warning was one on a five-inch fishing lure.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
I grew up in the South and whiled away the summers fishing.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Five-inch fishing lure, it's a big fishing lure,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
with a three pronged hook in the back,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
and outside it said, "Harmful if swallowed."

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:23.000
(Laughter)

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
So, none of these people

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
are doing what they think is right.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
And why not? They don't trust the law. Why don't they trust the law?

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Because it gives us the worst of both worlds:

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
It's random -- anybody can sue for almost anything

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
and take it to a jury, not even an effort at consistency --

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
and it's also too detailed.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
In the areas that are regulated, there are so many rules

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
no human could possibly know it.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Well how do you fix it? We could spend 10,000 lifetimes

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
trying to prune this legal jungle.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
But the challenge here is not one of just

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
amending the law,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
because the hurdle for success is trust.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
People -- for law to be the platform for freedom,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
people have to trust it.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
So, that's my second proposition:

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Trust is an essential condition

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
to a free society.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Life is complicated enough without legal fear.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
But law is different than other kinds of uncertainties,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
because it carries with it the power of state.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
And so the state can come in.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
It actually changes the way people think.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
It's like having a little lawyer on your shoulders

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
all day long, whispering in your ear,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
"Could that go wrong? Might that go wrong?"

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
It drives people from the smart part of the brain --

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
that dark, deep well of the subconscious,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
where instincts and experience,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
and all the other factors of creativity

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
and good judgment are --

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
it drives us to the thin veneer of conscious logic.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Pretty soon the doctor's saying, "Well, I doubt

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
if that headache could be a tumor, but who would protect me

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
if it were? So maybe I'll just order the MRI."

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Then you've wasted 200 billion dollars in unnecessary tests.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
If you make people self-conscious

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
about their judgments, studies show

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
you will make them make worse judgments.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
If you tell the pianist to think about how she's hitting the notes

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
when she's playing the piece, she can't play the piece.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Self-consciousness is the enemy of accomplishment.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Edison stated it best. He said,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
"Hell, we ain't got no rules around here,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
we're trying to accomplish something."

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
(Laughter)

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000
So, how do you restore trust?

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Tweaking the law's clearly not good enough,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
and tort reform, which is a great idea,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
lowers your cost if you're a businessperson,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
but it's like a Band-Aid on this gaping wound of distrust.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
States with extensive tort reform

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
still suffer all these pathologies.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
So, what's needed is not just to limit claims,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
but actually create a dry ground of freedom.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
It turns out that freedom actually has a formal structure.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
And it is this:

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Law sets boundaries,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
and on one side of those boundaries are all the things

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
you can't do or must do --

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000
you can't steal, you've got to pay your taxes --

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
but those same boundaries are supposed to define

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
and protect a dry ground of freedom.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Isaiah Berlin put it this way:

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
"Law sets frontiers, not artificially drawn,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
within which men shall be inviolable."

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
We've forgotten that second part.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Those dikes have burst. People wade through law

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
all day long.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
So, what's needed now

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
is to rebuild these boundaries.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
And it's especially important to rebuild them

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
for lawsuits.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Because what people can sue for establishes the boundaries

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
for everybody else's freedom.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
If someone brings a lawsuit over, "A kid fell off the seesaw,"

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
it doesn't matter what happens in the lawsuit,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
all the seesaws will disappear.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Because no one will want to take the risk of a lawsuit.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
And that's what's happened. There are no seesaws, jungle gyms,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
merry-go-rounds, climbing ropes,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
nothing that would interest a kid over the age of four,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
because there's no risk associated with it.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
So, how do we rebuild it?

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Life is too complex for...

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.000
(Applause)

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Life is too complex for a software program.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
All these choices involve value judgments

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
and social norms, not objective facts.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
And so here is the fourth proposition.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
This is what we have, the philosophy we have to change to.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
And there are two essential elements of it:

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
We have to simplify the law.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
We have to migrate from all this complexity

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
towards general principles and goals.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
The constitution is only 16 pages long.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Worked pretty well for 200 years.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Law has to be simple enough

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
so that people can internalize it

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
in their daily choices.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000
If they can't internalize it, they won't trust it.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
And how do you make it simple?

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Because life is complex,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
and here is the hardest and biggest change:

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
We have to restore the authority

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
to judges and officials

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
to interpret and apply the law.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
(Applause)

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
We have to rehumanize the law.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
To make law simple so that you feel free,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
the people in charge have to be free

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
to use their judgment to interpret and apply the law

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
in accord with reasonable social norms.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
As you're going down, and walking down the sidewalk during the day,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
you have to think that if there is a dispute,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
there's somebody in society who sees it as their job

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
to affirmatively protect you

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
if you're acting reasonably.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
That person doesn't exist today.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
This is the hardest hurdle.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
It's actually not very hard. Ninety-eight percent of cases, this is a piece of cake.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Maybe you've got a claim in small claims court

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
for your lost pair of pants for $100,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
but not in a court of general jurisdiction for millions of dollars.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Case dismissed without prejudice or refiling in small claims court.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Takes five minutes. That's it,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
it's not that hard.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
But it's a hard hurdle because we got into this legal quicksand

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
because we woke up in the 1960s

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
to all these really bad values: racism,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
gender discrimination, pollution --

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
they were bad values. And we wanted to create a legal system

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
where no one could have bad values anymore.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
The problem is, we created a system

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
where we eliminated the right to have good values.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
It doesn't mean that people in authority

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
can do whatever they want.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
They're still bounded by legal goals and principles:

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
The teacher is accountable to the principal,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
the judge is accountable to an appellate court,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
the president is accountable to voters.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
But the accountability's up the line

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
judging the decision against the effect on everybody,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
not just on the disgruntled person.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
You can't run a society by the lowest common denominator.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:47.000
(Applause)

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
So, what's needed is a basic shift in philosophy.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
We can pull the plug on a lot of this stuff if we shift our philosophy.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
We've been taught that authority is the enemy of freedom.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
It's not true. Authority, in fact,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
is essential to freedom.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Law is a human institution;

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
responsibility is a human institution.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
If teachers don't have authority to run the classroom,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
to maintain order, everybody's learning suffers.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
If the judge doesn't have the authority to toss out unreasonable claims,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
then all of us go through the day looking over our shoulders.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
If the environmental agency can't decide

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
that the power lines are good for the environment,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
then there's no way to bring the power from the wind farms

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
to the city.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
A free society requires red lights and green lights,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
otherwise it soon descends into gridlock.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
That's what's happened to America. Look around.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
What the world needs now

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
is to restore the authority to make common choices.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
It's the only way to get our freedom back,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
and it's the only way to release the energy and passion

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
needed so that we can meet the challenges

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
of our time. Thank you.
