00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Does anybody know when the stethoscope was invented?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Any guesses? 1816.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And what I can say is, in 2016,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
doctors aren't going to be walking around with stethoscopes.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
There's a whole lot better technology coming,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and that's part of the change in medicine.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
What has changed our society

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
has been wireless devices.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
But the future are digital medical wireless devices, OK?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So, let me give you some examples of this

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
to kind of make this much more concrete.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
This is the first one. This is an electrocardiogram.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And, as a cardiologist, to think that you could see in real time

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
a patient, an individual, anywhere in the world

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
on your smartphone,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
watching your rhythm -- that's incredible,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and it's with us today.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
But that's just the beginning.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
You check your email while you're sitting here.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
In the future you're going to be checking all your vital signs,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
all your vital signs: your heart rhythm,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
your blood pressure, your oxygen, your temperature, etc.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
This is already available today.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
This is AirStrip Technologies.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
It's now wired -- or I should say, wireless --

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
by taking the aggregate of these signals

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
in the hospital, in the intensive care unit,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and putting it on a smartphone for physicians.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
If you're an expectant parent,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
what about the ability to monitor, continuously,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
fetal heart rate, or intrauterine contractions,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and not having to worry so much that things are

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
fine as the pregnancy,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and moving over into the time of delivery?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And then as we go further,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
today we have continuous glucose sensors.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Right now, they are under the skin,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
but in the future, they won't have to be implanted.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And of course, the desired range -- trying to keep glucose

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
between 75 and less than 200,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
checking it every five minutes in a continuous glucose sensor --

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
you'll see how that can impact diabetes.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And what about sleep?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
We're going to zoom in on that a little bit.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
We're supposed to spend a third of our life in sleep.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
What if, on your phone,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
which will be available in the next few weeks,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
you had every minute of your sleep displayed?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And this is, of course, as you can see, the awake is the orange.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
The REM sleep, rapid eye movement,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
dream state, is in light green;

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and light is gray, light sleep;

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
and deep sleep, the best restorative sleep,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
is that dark green.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
How about counting every calorie?

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And this is ability, in real time, to actually take

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
measurements of caloric intake

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
as well as expenditure, through a Band-Aid.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Now, what I've talked about are physiologic metrics.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
But what I want to get to, the next frontier,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
very quickly, and why the stethoscope

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
is on its way out,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
is because we can transcend listening to the valve sounds,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
and the breath sounds, because now,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
introduced by G.E. is a handheld ultra-sound.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Why is this important? Because this is so much more sensitive.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Here is an example of an abdominal ultrasound,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
and also a cardiac echo, which can be sent wireless,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and then there's an example of fetal monitoring on your smartphone.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
So, we're not just talking about physiologic metrics --

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
the key measurements of vital signs,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and all those things in physiology -- but also all the imaging

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
that one could look at in your smartphone.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Now, this is an example of another obsolete technology,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
soon to be buried: the Holter Monitor.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Twenty-four hour recording, lots of wires.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
This is now a little tiny patch.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
You can put it on for two weeks

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and send it in the mail.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Now, how does this work? Well,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
there is these smart Band-Aids or these sensors

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
that one would put on, on a shoe or on the wrist.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And this sends a signal

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and it creates a body area network to a gateway.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Gateway could be a smartphone or it could be a dedicated gateway,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
as today many of these things are dedicated gateways,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
because they are not so well integrated.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
That signal goes to the web, the cloud,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
and then it can be processed and sent anywhere:

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
to a caregiver, to a physician,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
back to the patient, etc.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
So, that's basically very simplistic technology

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
of how this works.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Now, I have this device on.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
I didn't want to take my shirt off to show you, but I can tell you it's on.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
This is a device that not only measures cardiac rhythm,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
as you saw already,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
but it also goes well beyond that.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
This is me now. And you can see the ECG.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Below that's the actual heart rate and the trend;

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
to the right of that is a bioconductant.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
That's the fluid status,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
fluid status, that's really important

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
if you're monitoring somebody with heart failure.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
And below that's temperature,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
and respiration, and oxygen,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
and then the position activity.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
So, this is really striking, because this device

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
measures seven things

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
that are very much vital signs

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
for monitoring someone with heart failure. OK?

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And why is this important? Well,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
this is the most expensive bed.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
What if we could reduce the need for hospital beds?

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Well, we can. First of all, heart failure

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
is the number one reason

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
for hospital admissions and readmissions in this country.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
The cost of heart failure is 37 billion dollars a year,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
which is 80 percent related to hospitalization.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
And in the course of 30 days after a hospital stay

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
for a Medicare greater than 65 years or older,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
is -- 27 percent are readmitted in 30 days,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
and by six months, over 56 percent are readmitted.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
So, can we improve that? Well the idea is

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
we take this device that I'm wearing,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
and we put it on 600 patients with heart failure,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
randomly assigned, versus 600 patients

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
who don't have active monitoring,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
and see whether we can reduce heart failure readmissions,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
and that's exciting. And we'll start that trial,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
and you'll hear more about how we're going to do that,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
but that's a type of wireless device trial

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
that could change medicine in the years ahead.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Why now? Why has this all of a sudden become

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
a reality, an exciting direction in the future of medicine?

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
What we have is, in a way, a perfect positive storm.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
This sets up consumer-driven healthcare.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
That's where this is all starting.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Let me just give you specifics about why this is

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
a big movement if you're not aware of it:

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
1.2 million Americans

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
have gotten a Nike shoe, which is a body-area network

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
that connects the shoe, the sole of the shoe to the iPhone, or an iPod.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And this Wired Magazine cover article

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
really captured a lot of this; it talked a lot about the Nike shoe

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
and how quickly that's been adopted to monitor exercise physiology

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
and energy expenditure.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Here are some things, the principles

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
that are guiding principles to keep in mind:

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
"A data-driven health revolution

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
promises to make us all

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
better, faster, and stronger. Living by numbers."

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And this one, which is really telling,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
this was from July, this cover article:

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
"The personal metrics movement goes way beyond

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
diet and exercise. It's about tracking every facet

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
of life, from sleep to mood to pain,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
24/7/365."

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Well, I tried this device.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
A lot of you have gotten that Phillips Direct Life.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
I didn't have one of those,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
but I got the Fitbit.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
That looks like this.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
It's like a wireless accelerometer, pedometer.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
And I want to just give you the results of that testing,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
because I wanted to understand about the consumer movement.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
I hope the, by the way, the Phillips Direct Life works better --

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
I hope so.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
But this monitors food, it monitors activity and tracks weight.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
However you have to put in most of this stuff.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
The only thing it really tracks by itself is activity,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
and even then, it's not complete.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
So, you exercise and it picks up the exercise.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
You put in your height and weight, it calculates BMI,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
and of course it tells you how many calories you're expending

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
from the exercise, and how many you took in,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000
if you go in and enter all the foods.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
But it really wants you to enter all your activity.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And so I went to this,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
and of course I was gratified that it picked up

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
the 42 minutes of exercise, elliptical exercise I did,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
but then it wants more information.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
So, it says, "You want to log sexual activity.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
How long did you do it for?"

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
(Laughter)

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
And it says, "How hard was it?"

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000
(Laughter)

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Furthermore it says, "Start time."

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Now, this doesn't appear -- this just doesn't work,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
I mean, this just doesn't work.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
So, now I want to move to sleep.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Who would ever have thought you could have your own EEG

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
at your home, tagged to a very nice alarm clock, by the way?

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
This is the headband that goes with this alarm clock.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
It monitors your brainwaves continuously, when you're sleeping.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
So, I did this thing for seven days

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
getting ready for TEDMed.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
This is an important part of our life, one-third you're supposed to be sleeping.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Of course how many here

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
have any problems with sleeping?

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
It's usually 90 percent. So, you tell me you sleep better than expected.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Okay, well this was a week of

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
my life in sleeping,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
and you get a Z.Q. score. Instead of an I.Q. score,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
you get a Z.Q. score when you wake up.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
You say, "Oh, OK." And a Z.Q. score

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
is adjusted to age,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
and you want to get as high as you possibly can.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
So this is the moment-by-moment,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
or minute-by-minute sleep.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
And you see that Z.Q. there was 80-odd.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
And the wake time is in orange.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
And this can be a problem, as I learned.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Because it not only helps you with quantifying

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
your sleep,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
but also tells others you're awake.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
So, when my wife came in and she

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
could tell you're awake.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
"Eric, I want to talk. I want to talk."

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And I'm trying to play possum.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
This thing is very, very impressive.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
OK. So, that's the first night.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
And this one is now 67,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
and that's not a good score.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
And this tells you, of course, how much you had in REM sleep,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
in deep sleep, and all this sort of thing.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
This was really fascinating because

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
this gave that quantitation

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
about all the different phases of sleep.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
So, it also then tells you how you do compared to your age group.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
It's like a managed competition of sleep.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
And really interesting stuff.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Look at this thing and say, "Well, I didn't think I was a very good sleeper,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000
but actually I did better than average in 50 to 60 year olds." OK?

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
And the key thing was, what I didn't know,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
was that I was a really good dreamer.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
OK. Now let's move from sleep to diseases.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Eighty percent of Americans have chronic disease,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
or 80 percent of age greater than 65 have

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
two or more chronic disease,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
140 million Americans

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
have one or more chronic disease,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
and 80 percent of our 1.5, whatever, trillion

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
expenditures are related to chronic disease.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Now, diabetes is one of the big ones.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
Almost 24 million people have diabetes.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
And here is the latest map. It was published

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
just a little more than a week ago in the New York Times,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
and it isn't looking good.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
That is, for men, 29 percent

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
in the country over 60 have Type II diabetes,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
and women, although it's less, it's terribly high.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
But of course we have a way to measure that now

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
on a continuous basis,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
with a sensor that detects blood glucose,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
and it's important because we could detect

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
hyperglycemia that otherwise wouldn't be known,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
and also hypoglycemia.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And you can see the red dots, in this particular patient's case,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
were finger sticks, which would have missed both ends.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
But by continuous monitoring,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
it captures all that vital information.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
The future of this though,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
is being able to move this to a Band-Aid type phenomenon,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
and that's not so far away.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
So, let me just give you, very quickly,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
10 top targets for wireless medicine.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
All these things are possible --

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
some of them are very close,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
or already, as you heard,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
are available today, in some way or form.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Alzheimer's disease:

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
there's five million people affected, and you can check

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
vital signs, activity, balance.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Asthma: large number, we could detect things like

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
pollen count, air quality, respiratory rate. Breast cancer,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
I'll show you an example of that real quickly.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Depression, there's a great approach to that in mood disorders.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Diabetes I've just mentioned. Heart failure we already talked about. Hypertension:

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
74 million people could have continuous blood-pressure monitoring

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
to come up with much better management and prevention.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
And obesity we already talked about, the ways to get to that.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
And sleep disorders.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
This is effective around the world. The access to smartphones

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
and cell phones today is extraordinary.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
And this article from The Economist summed it up beautifully

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
about the opportunities in health across the developing world:

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
"Mobile phones made a bigger difference to the lives of more people,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
more quickly, than any previous technology."

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
And that's before we got going on the m-health world.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Aging: The problem is enormous,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
300,000 broken hips per year;

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
but the solutions are extraordinary,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
and they include so many different things.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
One of the ones I just wanted to mention:

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
The iShoe is another example of a sensor that

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
improves proprioception among the elderly

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000
to prevent falling.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
One of many different techniques using wireless sensors.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
So, we can change medicine across the continuum of care,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
across the ages from premies or unborn children

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
to seniors; the pharmaceutical arena changes;

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
the full spectrum of disease -- I hope I've given you a sense of that --

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
across the globe.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
There are two things that can really accelerate this whole process.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
One of them -- we're very fortunate -- is to develop a dedicated institute

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.000
and that's work that started with the work that Scripps with Qualcomm ...

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
and then the great fortune of meeting up with Gary and Mary West,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
to get behind this wireless health institute.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
San Diego is an extraordinary place for this.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
There's over 650 wireless companies,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
100 of which or more are working in wireless health.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
It's the number one source of commerce, and interestingly

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
it dovetails beautifully with over 500 life science companies.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
The wireless institute,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
the West Wireless Health Institute,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
is really the outgrowth of two extraordinary people

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
who are here this evening:

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Gary and Mary West. And I'd like to give it up for them for getting behind this.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
(Applause)

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Their fantastic philanthropic investment made this possible,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
and this is really a nonprofit education center

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
which is just about to open. It looks like this,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
this whole building dedicated.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
And what it's trying to do is accelerate this era:

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
to take unmet medical needs, to work and innovate --

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
and we just appointed the chief engineer, Mehran Mehregany,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
it was announced on Monday --

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
then to move up with development,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
clinical trial validation and then changing medical practice,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
the most challenging thing of all,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
requiring attention to reimbursement, healthcare policy, healthcare economics.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
The other big thing, besides having this fantastic

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
institute to catalyze this process

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
is guidance,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
and that's of course relying on the fact that medicine goes digital.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
If we understand biology from genomics and omics

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
and wireless through physiologic phenotyping, that's big.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
Because what it does is allow a convergence like we've never had before.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Over 80 major diseases have been cracked at the genomic level,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
but this is quite extraordinary: More has been learned about

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
the underpinnings of disease in the last two and a half years

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
than in the history of man.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
And when you put that together with, for example,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
now an app for the iPhone with your genotype

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
to guide drug therapy ...

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
but, the future -- we can now tell who's going to get Type II diabetes

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
from all the common variants,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
and that's going to get filled in more

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
with low-frequency variants in the future.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
We can tell who's going to get breast cancer

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
from the various genes.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
We can also know who's likely to get atrial fibrillation.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
And finally, another example: sudden cardiac death.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Each of these has a sensor.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000
We can give glucose a sensor for diabetes to prevent it.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
We can prevent, or have the earliest detection possible,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
for breast cancer with an ultrasound device

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
given to the patient.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
An iPatch, iRhythm, for atrial fibrillation.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
And vital-signs monitoring to prevent sudden cardiac death.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
We lose 700,000 people a year in the U.S. from sudden cardiac death.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
So, I hope I've convinced you of this,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000
of the impact on hospital clinic resources is profound

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
and then the impact on diseases is equally impressive

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
across all these different diseases and more.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
It's really taking individualized medicine to a new height

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
and it's hyper-innovative,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
and I think it represents the black swan of medicine.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Thanks for your attention.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
(Applause)
