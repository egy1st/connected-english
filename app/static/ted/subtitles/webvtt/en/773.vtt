WEBVTT

00:00:00.444 --> 00:00:02.890
I think I'll start out
and just talk a little bit

00:00:02.914 --> 00:00:04.405
about what exactly autism is.

00:00:04.429 --> 00:00:07.064
Autism is a very big continuum

00:00:07.088 --> 00:00:10.262
that goes from very severe --
the child remains nonverbal --

00:00:10.286 --> 00:00:12.976
all the way up to brilliant
scientists and engineers.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.977
And I actually feel at home here,

00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:17.547
because there's a lot
of autism genetics here.

00:00:17.571 --> 00:00:18.603
(Laughter)

00:00:18.627 --> 00:00:19.785
You wouldn't have any --

00:00:19.809 --> 00:00:22.778
(Applause)

00:00:22.802 --> 00:00:24.838
It's a continuum of traits.

00:00:24.862 --> 00:00:30.519
When does a nerd turn into Asperger,
which is just mild autism?

00:00:30.543 --> 00:00:35.701
I mean, Einstein and Mozart and Tesla
would all be probably diagnosed

00:00:35.725 --> 00:00:37.617
as autistic spectrum today.

00:00:37.641 --> 00:00:40.932
And one of the things
that is really going to concern me

00:00:40.956 --> 00:00:43.191
is getting these kids to be the ones

00:00:43.215 --> 00:00:46.037
that are going to invent
the next energy things

00:00:46.061 --> 00:00:48.311
that Bill Gates talked about this morning.

00:00:48.798 --> 00:00:52.711
OK, now, if you want
to understand autism: animals.

00:00:52.735 --> 00:00:55.625
I want to talk to you now
about different ways of thinking.

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.499
You have to get away from verbal language.

00:00:58.523 --> 00:01:02.124
I think in pictures.
I don't think in language.

00:01:02.822 --> 00:01:08.092
Now, the thing about the autistic mind
is it attends to details.

00:01:08.116 --> 00:01:11.171
This is a test where you either
have to pick out the big letters

00:01:11.195 --> 00:01:12.418
or the little letters,

00:01:12.442 --> 00:01:16.335
and the autistic mind picks out
the little letters more quickly.

00:01:16.687 --> 00:01:20.438
And the thing is, the normal brain
ignores the details.

00:01:20.462 --> 00:01:23.472
Well, if you're building a bridge,
details are pretty important

00:01:23.496 --> 00:01:25.894
because it'll fall down
if you ignore the details.

00:01:25.918 --> 00:01:28.785
And one of my big concerns
with a lot of policy things today

00:01:28.809 --> 00:01:30.487
is things are getting too abstract.

00:01:30.511 --> 00:01:33.738
People are getting away
from doing hands-on stuff.

00:01:33.762 --> 00:01:35.922
I'm really concerned
that a lot of the schools

00:01:35.946 --> 00:01:39.914
have taken out the hands-on classes,
because art, and classes like that --

00:01:39.938 --> 00:01:42.251
those are the classes where I excelled.

00:01:42.275 --> 00:01:44.429
In my work with cattle,

00:01:44.453 --> 00:01:47.431
I noticed a lot of little things
that most people don't notice

00:01:47.455 --> 00:01:48.743
would make the cattle balk.

00:01:48.767 --> 00:01:52.314
For example, this flag waving
right in front of the veterinary facility.

00:01:52.338 --> 00:01:55.665
This feed yard was going to tear down
their whole veterinary facility;

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:57.603
all they needed to do was move the flag.

00:01:57.627 --> 00:01:59.695
Rapid movement, contrast.

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:02.753
In the early '70s when I started,
I got right down in the chutes

00:02:02.777 --> 00:02:04.276
to see what cattle were seeing.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.762
People thought that was crazy.

00:02:05.786 --> 00:02:09.068
A coat on a fence would make them balk,
shadows would make them balk,

00:02:09.092 --> 00:02:12.156
a hose on the floor --
people weren't noticing these things.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.696
A chain hanging down ...

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.976
And that's shown
very, very nicely in the movie.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.455
In fact, I loved the movie,
how they duplicated all my projects.

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:20.820
That's the geek side.

00:02:20.844 --> 00:02:23.264
My drawings got to star in the movie, too.

00:02:23.288 --> 00:02:25.398
And, actually, it's called
"Temple Grandin,"

00:02:25.422 --> 00:02:26.746
not "Thinking in Pictures."

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.335
So what is thinking in pictures?

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:31.038
It's literally movies in your head.

00:02:31.062 --> 00:02:33.944
My mind works like Google for images.

00:02:33.968 --> 00:02:37.012
When I was a young kid,
I didn't know my thinking was different.

00:02:37.036 --> 00:02:38.955
I thought everybody thought in pictures.

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:41.234
Then when I did my book,
"Thinking in Pictures,"

00:02:41.258 --> 00:02:43.670
I started interviewing people
about how they think.

00:02:43.694 --> 00:02:46.849
And I was shocked to find out
that my thinking was quite different.

00:02:46.873 --> 00:02:49.049
Like if I say, "Think
about a church steeple,"

00:02:49.073 --> 00:02:51.586
most people get this sort
of generalized generic one.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.522
Now, maybe that's not true in this room,

00:02:53.546 --> 00:02:56.812
but it's going to be true
in a lot of different places.

00:02:56.836 --> 00:02:59.339
I see only specific pictures.

00:02:59.363 --> 00:03:03.172
They flash up into my memory,
just like Google for pictures.

00:03:03.196 --> 00:03:05.739
And in the movie,
they've got a great scene in there,

00:03:05.763 --> 00:03:09.563
where the word "shoe" is said,
and a whole bunch of '50s and '60s shoes

00:03:09.587 --> 00:03:11.253
pop into my imagination.

00:03:11.648 --> 00:03:14.159
OK, there's my childhood church;
that's specific.

00:03:14.547 --> 00:03:16.415
There's some more, Fort Collins.

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:18.486
OK, how about famous ones?

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.187
And they just kind of come up,
kind of like this.

00:03:21.211 --> 00:03:24.122
Just really quickly,
like Google for pictures.

00:03:24.146 --> 00:03:25.705
And they come up one at a time,

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:28.680
and then I think, "OK, well,
maybe we can have it snow,

00:03:28.704 --> 00:03:30.328
or we can have a thunderstorm,"

00:03:30.352 --> 00:03:32.976
and I can hold it there
and turn them into videos.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.213
Now, visual thinking
was a tremendous asset

00:03:36.237 --> 00:03:39.039
in my work designing
cattle-handling facilities.

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:42.739
And I've worked really hard
on improving how cattle are treated

00:03:42.763 --> 00:03:43.915
at the slaughter plant.

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:46.435
I'm not going to go
into any gucky slaughter slides.

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.347
I've got that stuff up on YouTube,
if you want to look at it.

00:03:49.371 --> 00:03:50.412
(Laughter)

00:03:50.436 --> 00:03:53.329
But one of the things
that I was able to do in my design work

00:03:53.353 --> 00:03:55.976
is I could test-run a piece
of equipment in my mind,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.432
just like a virtual reality
computer system.

00:03:59.448 --> 00:04:03.089
And this is an aerial view
of a recreation of one of my projects

00:04:03.113 --> 00:04:04.475
that was used in the movie.

00:04:04.499 --> 00:04:06.510
That was like just so super cool.

00:04:06.534 --> 00:04:10.012
And there were a lot of, kind of,
Asperger types and autism types

00:04:10.036 --> 00:04:11.984
working out there on the movie set, too.

00:04:12.008 --> 00:04:13.184
(Laughter)

00:04:13.208 --> 00:04:15.999
But one of the things
that really worries me is:

00:04:16.023 --> 00:04:19.027
Where's the younger version
of those kids going today?

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.015
They're not ending up in Silicon Valley,

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:23.279
where they belong.

00:04:23.303 --> 00:04:25.123
(Laughter)

00:04:25.147 --> 00:04:30.055
(Applause)

00:04:30.079 --> 00:04:33.660
One of the things I learned very early on
because I wasn't that social,

00:04:33.684 --> 00:04:37.095
is I had to sell my work, and not myself.

00:04:37.446 --> 00:04:40.406
And the way I sold livestock jobs
is I showed off my drawings,

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.162
I showed off pictures of things.

00:04:42.186 --> 00:04:44.425
Another thing that helped me
as a little kid

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:46.678
is, boy, in the '50s,
you were taught manners.

00:04:46.702 --> 00:04:49.741
You were taught you can't pull
the merchandise off the shelves

00:04:49.765 --> 00:04:51.399
in the store and throw it around.

00:04:51.423 --> 00:04:53.575
When kids get to be
in third or fourth grade,

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:56.427
you might see that this kid's going
to be a visual thinker,

00:04:56.451 --> 00:04:57.716
drawing in perspective.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:58.938
Now, I want to emphasize

00:04:58.962 --> 00:05:01.885
that not every autistic kid
is going to be a visual thinker.

00:05:02.452 --> 00:05:06.430
Now, I had this brain scan
done several years ago,

00:05:06.454 --> 00:05:10.387
and I used to joke around about having
a gigantic Internet trunk line

00:05:10.411 --> 00:05:12.338
going deep into my visual cortex.

00:05:12.362 --> 00:05:14.237
This is tensor imaging.

00:05:14.261 --> 00:05:18.113
And my great big Internet trunk line
is twice as big as the control's.

00:05:18.137 --> 00:05:19.741
The red lines there are me,

00:05:19.765 --> 00:05:23.674
and the blue lines are the sex
and age-matched control.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.612
And there I got a gigantic one,

00:05:26.636 --> 00:05:30.644
and the control over there, the blue one,
has got a really small one.

00:05:31.841 --> 00:05:33.976
And some of the research now is showing

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.031
that people on the spectrum actually
think with the primary visual cortex.

00:05:38.055 --> 00:05:41.096
Now, the thing is, the visual thinker
is just one kind of mind.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.705
You see, the autistic mind
tends to be a specialist mind --

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:47.342
good at one thing, bad at something else.

00:05:47.842 --> 00:05:49.596
And where I was bad was algebra.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.910
And I was never allowed
to take geometry or trig.

00:05:51.934 --> 00:05:53.097
Gigantic mistake.

00:05:53.121 --> 00:05:55.556
I'm finding a lot of kids
who need to skip algebra,

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.229
go right to geometry and trig.

00:05:57.587 --> 00:06:00.187
Now, another kind of mind
is the pattern thinker.

00:06:00.211 --> 00:06:01.450
More abstract.

00:06:01.474 --> 00:06:04.037
These are your engineers,
your computer programmers.

00:06:04.061 --> 00:06:05.455
This is pattern thinking.

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:08.364
That praying mantis is made
from a single sheet of paper --

00:06:08.388 --> 00:06:09.805
no scotch tape, no cuts.

00:06:09.829 --> 00:06:13.364
And there in the background
is the pattern for folding it.

00:06:13.388 --> 00:06:15.033
Here are the types of thinking:

00:06:15.471 --> 00:06:18.023
photo-realistic visual thinkers, like me;

00:06:18.596 --> 00:06:21.976
pattern thinkers, music and math minds.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.588
Some of these oftentimes
have problems with reading.

00:06:24.612 --> 00:06:29.093
You also will see these kind of problems
with kids that are dyslexic.

00:06:29.117 --> 00:06:31.141
You'll see these different kinds of minds.

00:06:31.165 --> 00:06:34.739
And then there's a verbal mind,
they know every fact about everything.

00:06:34.763 --> 00:06:36.729
Now, another thing is the sensory issues.

00:06:36.753 --> 00:06:40.045
I was really concerned about having
to wear this gadget on my face.

00:06:40.432 --> 00:06:42.586
And I came in half an hour beforehand

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.593
so I could have it put on
and kind of get used to it,

00:06:45.617 --> 00:06:48.355
and they got it bent
so it's not hitting my chin.

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:49.531
But sensory is an issue.

00:06:49.555 --> 00:06:51.704
Some kids are bothered
by fluorescent lights;

00:06:51.728 --> 00:06:53.885
others have problems
with sound sensitivity.

00:06:54.237 --> 00:06:56.410
You know, it's going to be variable.

00:06:57.392 --> 00:07:00.812
Now, visual thinking gave me
a whole lot of insight

00:07:00.836 --> 00:07:03.096
into the animal mind.

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.553
Because think about it:
an animal is a sensory-based thinker,

00:07:06.577 --> 00:07:12.774
not verbal -- thinks in pictures,
thinks in sounds, thinks in smells.

00:07:12.798 --> 00:07:16.142
Think about how much information
there is on the local fire hydrant.

00:07:16.166 --> 00:07:17.528
He knows who's been there --

00:07:17.552 --> 00:07:18.583
(Laughter)

00:07:18.607 --> 00:07:19.764
When they were there.

00:07:19.788 --> 00:07:22.683
Are they friend or foe?
Is there anybody he can go mate with?

00:07:22.707 --> 00:07:25.589
There's a ton of information
on that fire hydrant.

00:07:25.613 --> 00:07:28.399
It's all very detailed information.

00:07:28.736 --> 00:07:32.975
And looking at these kind of details
gave me a lot of insight into animals.

00:07:33.428 --> 00:07:36.976
Now, the animal mind, and also my mind,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.569
puts sensory-based information
into categories.

00:07:41.593 --> 00:07:43.296
Man on a horse,

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:44.875
and a man on the ground --

00:07:44.899 --> 00:07:47.684
that is viewed as two
totally different things.

00:07:47.708 --> 00:07:50.207
You could have a horse
that's been abused by a rider.

00:07:50.231 --> 00:07:52.501
They'll be absolutely fine
with the veterinarian

00:07:52.525 --> 00:07:54.976
and with the horseshoer,
but you can't ride him.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.175
You have another horse,
where maybe the horseshoer beat him up,

00:07:58.199 --> 00:08:02.194
and he'll be terrible for anything
on the ground with the veterinarian,

00:08:02.218 --> 00:08:04.233
but a person can ride him.

00:08:04.257 --> 00:08:05.564
Cattle are the same way.

00:08:05.588 --> 00:08:09.513
Man on a horse, a man on foot --
they're two different things.

00:08:09.537 --> 00:08:11.493
You see, it's a different picture.

00:08:11.517 --> 00:08:14.638
See, I want you to think
about just how specific this is.

00:08:14.662 --> 00:08:18.049
Now, this ability to put
information into categories,

00:08:18.073 --> 00:08:21.425
I find a lot of people
are not very good at this.

00:08:21.449 --> 00:08:23.617
When I'm out troubleshooting equipment

00:08:23.641 --> 00:08:25.469
or problems with something in a plant,

00:08:25.493 --> 00:08:27.498
they don't seem to be able to figure out:

00:08:27.522 --> 00:08:29.222
"Do I have a training-people issue?

00:08:29.246 --> 00:08:31.681
Or do I have something wrong
with the equipment?"

00:08:31.705 --> 00:08:35.399
In other words, categorize
equipment problem from a people problem.

00:08:35.423 --> 00:08:38.519
I find a lot of people
have difficulty doing that.

00:08:38.543 --> 00:08:41.107
Now, let's say I figure out
it's an equipment problem.

00:08:41.131 --> 00:08:43.907
Is it a minor problem,
with something simple I can fix?

00:08:43.931 --> 00:08:46.246
Or is the whole design
of the system wrong?

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:48.976
People have a hard time figuring that out.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.096
Let's just look at something
like, you know,

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.366
solving problems with making
airlines safer.

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:54.976
Yeah, I'm a million-mile flier.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.826
I do lots and lots of flying,

00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:00.082
and if I was at the FAA,

00:09:00.106 --> 00:09:03.628
what would I be doing a lot
of direct observation of?

00:09:04.197 --> 00:09:06.501
It would be their airplane tails.

00:09:06.525 --> 00:09:09.075
You know, five fatal wrecks
in the last 20 years,

00:09:09.099 --> 00:09:10.874
the tail either came off,

00:09:10.898 --> 00:09:14.332
or steering stuff inside the tail
broke in some way.

00:09:14.747 --> 00:09:16.800
It's tails, pure and simple.

00:09:16.824 --> 00:09:19.357
And when the pilots walk
around the plane, guess what?

00:09:19.381 --> 00:09:21.432
They can't see that stuff inside the tail.

00:09:21.456 --> 00:09:22.893
Now as I think about that,

00:09:22.917 --> 00:09:26.376
I'm pulling up all of that
specific information.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.573
It's specific.

00:09:27.597 --> 00:09:29.092
See, my thinking's bottom-up.

00:09:29.116 --> 00:09:32.813
I take all the little pieces and I put
the pieces together like a puzzle.

00:09:32.837 --> 00:09:36.604
Now, here is a horse that was deathly
afraid of black cowboy hats.

00:09:36.628 --> 00:09:39.188
He'd been abused by somebody
with a black cowboy hat.

00:09:39.212 --> 00:09:42.101
White cowboy hats,
that was absolutely fine.

00:09:42.596 --> 00:09:45.146
Now, the thing is,
the world is going to need

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:49.259
all of the different kinds of minds
to work together.

00:09:49.283 --> 00:09:52.474
We've got to work on developing
all these different kinds of minds.

00:09:52.498 --> 00:09:55.040
And one of the things
that is driving me really crazy

00:09:55.064 --> 00:09:57.411
as I travel around
and I do autism meetings,

00:09:57.435 --> 00:10:00.576
is I'm seeing a lot of smart,
geeky, nerdy kids,

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.775
and they just aren't very social,

00:10:02.799 --> 00:10:05.890
and nobody's working
on developing their interest

00:10:05.914 --> 00:10:07.289
in something like science.

00:10:07.666 --> 00:10:10.353
And this brings up the whole thing
of my science teacher.

00:10:10.377 --> 00:10:13.485
My science teacher is shown
absolutely beautifully in the movie.

00:10:13.509 --> 00:10:15.995
I was a goofball student
when I was in high school.

00:10:16.019 --> 00:10:18.047
I just didn't care at all about studying,

00:10:18.071 --> 00:10:21.300
until I had Mr. Carlock's science class.

00:10:21.324 --> 00:10:23.696
He was now Dr. Carlock in the movie.

00:10:24.097 --> 00:10:29.976
And he got me challenged
to figure out an optical illusion room.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.715
This brings up the whole thing
of you've got to show kids

00:10:32.739 --> 00:10:33.896
interesting stuff.

00:10:34.314 --> 00:10:37.627
You know, one of the things
that I think maybe TED ought to do

00:10:37.651 --> 00:10:40.966
is tell all the schools about all
the great lectures that are on TED,

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:43.477
and there's all kinds
of great stuff on the Internet

00:10:43.501 --> 00:10:44.873
to get these kids turned on.

00:10:44.897 --> 00:10:47.383
Because I'm seeing a lot
of these geeky, nerdy kids,

00:10:47.407 --> 00:10:50.591
and the teachers out in the Midwest
and other parts of the country

00:10:50.615 --> 00:10:52.553
when you get away from these tech areas,

00:10:52.577 --> 00:10:54.589
they don't know what to do
with these kids.

00:10:54.613 --> 00:10:56.634
And they're not going down the right path.

00:10:56.658 --> 00:10:58.440
The thing is, you can make a mind

00:10:58.464 --> 00:11:01.189
to be more of a thinking
and cognitive mind,

00:11:01.213 --> 00:11:03.688
or your mind can be wired
to be more social.

00:11:03.712 --> 00:11:06.343
And what some of the research
now has shown in autism

00:11:06.367 --> 00:11:09.837
is there may by extra wiring back here
in the really brilliant mind,

00:11:09.861 --> 00:11:11.774
and we lose a few social circuits here.

00:11:11.798 --> 00:11:14.749
It's kind of a trade-off
between thinking and social.

00:11:14.773 --> 00:11:17.365
And then you can get to the point
where it's so severe,

00:11:17.389 --> 00:11:20.245
you're going to have a person
that's going to be non-verbal.

00:11:20.269 --> 00:11:21.976
In the normal human mind,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.622
language covers up the visual thinking
we share with animals.

00:11:25.646 --> 00:11:28.337
This is the work of Dr. Bruce Miller.

00:11:29.496 --> 00:11:33.228
He studied Alzheimer's patients
that had frontal temporal lobe dementia.

00:11:33.252 --> 00:11:36.275
And the dementia ate out
the language parts of the brain.

00:11:36.299 --> 00:11:38.570
And then this artwork came out of somebody

00:11:38.594 --> 00:11:40.562
who used to install stereos in cars.

00:11:41.567 --> 00:11:45.233
Now, Van Gogh doesn't know
anything about physics,

00:11:45.257 --> 00:11:48.578
but I think it's very interesting
that there was some work done

00:11:48.602 --> 00:11:51.325
to show that this eddy pattern
in this painting

00:11:51.349 --> 00:11:54.497
followed a statistical model
of turbulence,

00:11:54.521 --> 00:11:56.540
which brings up the whole interesting idea

00:11:56.564 --> 00:12:00.302
of maybe some of this mathematical
patterns is in our own head.

00:12:00.326 --> 00:12:01.879
And the Wolfram stuff --

00:12:01.903 --> 00:12:06.469
I was taking notes and writing down
all the search words I could use,

00:12:06.493 --> 00:12:09.820
because I think that's going to go on
in my autism lectures.

00:12:09.844 --> 00:12:12.271
We've got to show
these kids interesting stuff.

00:12:12.295 --> 00:12:14.562
And they've taken out the auto-shop class

00:12:14.586 --> 00:12:16.686
and the drafting class and the art class.

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:18.976
I mean, art was my best subject in school.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.859
We've got to think about all
these different kinds of minds,

00:12:21.883 --> 00:12:24.663
and we've got to absolutely
work with these kind of minds,

00:12:24.687 --> 00:12:26.975
because we absolutely are going to need

00:12:26.999 --> 00:12:29.520
these kinds of people in the future.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.779
And let's talk about jobs.

00:12:32.264 --> 00:12:34.457
OK, my science teacher got me studying,

00:12:34.481 --> 00:12:36.895
because I was a goofball
that didn't want to study.

00:12:36.919 --> 00:12:39.264
But you know what?
I was getting work experience.

00:12:39.288 --> 00:12:42.752
I'm seeing too many of these smart kids
who haven't learned basic things,

00:12:42.776 --> 00:12:46.224
like how to be on time -- I was taught
that when I was eight years old.

00:12:46.248 --> 00:12:48.803
How to have table manners
at granny's Sunday party.

00:12:48.827 --> 00:12:51.012
I was taught that
when I was very, very young.

00:12:51.486 --> 00:12:56.463
And when I was 13, I had a job
at a dressmaker's shop sewing clothes.

00:12:56.487 --> 00:12:59.075
I did internships in college,

00:12:59.099 --> 00:13:02.302
I was building things,

00:13:02.326 --> 00:13:05.343
and I also had to learn
how to do assignments.

00:13:05.367 --> 00:13:08.957
You know, all I wanted to do was draw
pictures of horses when I was little.

00:13:08.981 --> 00:13:11.809
My mother said, "Well let's do
a picture of something else."

00:13:11.833 --> 00:13:13.997
They've got to learn
how to do something else.

00:13:14.021 --> 00:13:15.865
Let's say the kid is fixated on Legos.

00:13:15.889 --> 00:13:18.586
Let's get him working
on building different things.

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:22.206
The thing about the autistic mind
is it tends to be fixated.

00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:26.108
Like if the kid loves race cars,
let's use race cars for math.

00:13:26.132 --> 00:13:29.572
Let's figure out how long it takes
a race car to go a certain distance.

00:13:29.596 --> 00:13:32.709
In other words, use that fixation

00:13:32.733 --> 00:13:36.589
in order to motivate that kid,
that's one of the things we need to do.

00:13:36.613 --> 00:13:39.701
I really get fed up when the teachers,

00:13:39.725 --> 00:13:42.527
especially when you get away
from this part of the country,

00:13:42.551 --> 00:13:44.931
they don't know what to do
with these smart kids.

00:13:44.955 --> 00:13:46.118
It just drives me crazy.

00:13:46.142 --> 00:13:48.384
What can visual thinkers
do when they grow up?

00:13:48.408 --> 00:13:51.357
They can do graphic design,
all kinds of stuff with computers,

00:13:51.381 --> 00:13:54.764
photography, industrial design.

00:13:56.383 --> 00:14:00.315
The pattern thinkers -- they're the ones
that are going to be your mathematicians,

00:14:00.339 --> 00:14:02.846
your software engineers,
your computer programmers,

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:04.833
all of those kinds of jobs.

00:14:04.857 --> 00:14:08.429
And then you've got the word minds;
they make great journalists,

00:14:08.453 --> 00:14:10.976
and they also make really,
really good stage actors.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.392
Because the thing about being autistic is,

00:14:13.416 --> 00:14:16.247
I had to learn social skills
like being in a play.

00:14:16.271 --> 00:14:18.644
You just kind of ...
you just have to learn it.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.976
And we need to be working
with these students.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.108
And this brings up mentors.

00:14:24.132 --> 00:14:27.232
You know, my science teacher
was not an accredited teacher.

00:14:27.256 --> 00:14:28.976
He was a NASA space scientist.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.404
Some states now are getting it to where,
if you have a degree in biology

00:14:32.428 --> 00:14:33.699
or in chemistry,

00:14:33.723 --> 00:14:36.560
you can come into the school
and teach biology or chemistry.

00:14:36.584 --> 00:14:38.110
We need to be doing that.

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:40.330
Because what I'm observing is,

00:14:40.354 --> 00:14:42.403
the good teachers,
for a lot of these kids,

00:14:42.427 --> 00:14:44.075
are out in the community colleges.

00:14:44.099 --> 00:14:46.635
But we need to be getting
some of these good teachers

00:14:46.659 --> 00:14:47.810
into the high schools.

00:14:47.834 --> 00:14:51.390
Another thing that can be very,
very, very successful is:

00:14:51.414 --> 00:14:53.522
there's a lot of people
that may have retired

00:14:53.546 --> 00:14:55.368
from working in the software industry,

00:14:55.392 --> 00:14:56.780
and they can teach your kid.

00:14:56.804 --> 00:14:59.613
And it doesn't matter
if what they teach them is old,

00:14:59.637 --> 00:15:02.364
because what you're doing
is you're lighting the spark.

00:15:02.388 --> 00:15:04.852
You're getting that kid turned on.

00:15:04.876 --> 00:15:08.291
And you get him turned on,
then you'll learn all the new stuff.

00:15:08.315 --> 00:15:10.579
Mentors are just essential.

00:15:10.603 --> 00:15:14.336
I cannot emphasize enough
what my science teacher did for me.

00:15:14.944 --> 00:15:17.976
And we've got to mentor them, hire them.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.808
And if you bring them in
for internships in your companies,

00:15:20.832 --> 00:15:23.305
the thing about the autism,
Asperger-y kind of mind,

00:15:23.329 --> 00:15:25.297
you've got to give them a specific task.

00:15:25.321 --> 00:15:27.163
Don't just say, "Design new software."

00:15:27.187 --> 00:15:29.454
You've got to tell them
something more specific:

00:15:29.478 --> 00:15:31.375
"We're designing software for a phone

00:15:31.399 --> 00:15:33.199
and it has to do some specific thing,

00:15:33.223 --> 00:15:34.976
and it can only use so much memory."

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.427
That's the kind of specificity you need.

00:15:37.451 --> 00:15:39.310
Well, that's the end of my talk.

00:15:39.334 --> 00:15:41.577
And I just want to thank
everybody for coming.

00:15:41.601 --> 00:15:42.976
It was great to be here.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:50.000
(Applause)

00:15:54.526 --> 00:15:56.717
(Applause ends)

00:15:56.741 --> 00:15:58.566
Oh -- you have a question for me? OK.

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:00.987
(Applause)

00:16:01.011 --> 00:16:03.039
Chris Anderson:
Thank you so much for that.

00:16:03.063 --> 00:16:05.389
You know, you once wrote --
I like this quote:

00:16:05.413 --> 00:16:09.974
"If by some magic, autism had been
eradicated from the face of the Earth,

00:16:09.998 --> 00:16:12.975
then men would still be socializing
in front of a wood fire

00:16:12.999 --> 00:16:14.340
at the entrance to a cave."

00:16:14.364 --> 00:16:15.392
(Laughter)

00:16:15.416 --> 00:16:18.652
Temple Grandin: Because who do you think
made the first stone spear?

00:16:18.676 --> 00:16:19.834
It was the Asperger guy,

00:16:19.858 --> 00:16:22.411
and if you were to get rid
of all the autism genetics,

00:16:22.435 --> 00:16:26.100
there'd be no more Silicon Valley,
and the energy crisis would not be solved.

00:16:26.124 --> 00:16:27.465
(Applause)

00:16:27.489 --> 00:16:29.719
CA: I want to ask you
a couple other questions,

00:16:29.743 --> 00:16:33.507
and if any of these feel inappropriate,
it's OK just to say, "Next question."

00:16:33.531 --> 00:16:37.145
But if there is someone here
who has an autistic child,

00:16:37.169 --> 00:16:41.910
or knows an autistic child and feels
kind of cut off from them,

00:16:42.533 --> 00:16:44.380
what advice would you give them?

00:16:44.404 --> 00:16:46.733
TG: Well, first of all,
we've got to look at age.

00:16:46.757 --> 00:16:50.706
If you have a two, three or four-year-old,
no speech, no social interaction,

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:53.019
I can't emphasize enough: Don't wait.

00:16:53.043 --> 00:16:56.173
You need at least 20 hours a week
of one-to-one teaching.

00:16:56.352 --> 00:16:58.845
The thing is, autism comes
in different degrees.

00:16:58.869 --> 00:17:02.376
About half of the people on the spectrum
are not going to learn to talk,

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.501
and they won't be working
in Silicon Valley.

00:17:04.525 --> 00:17:06.975
That would not be a reasonable
thing for them to do.

00:17:06.999 --> 00:17:10.076
But then you get these smart,
geeky kids with a touch of autism,

00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:12.580
and that's where you've got
to get them turned on

00:17:12.604 --> 00:17:14.093
with doing interesting things.

00:17:14.117 --> 00:17:17.132
I got social interaction
through shared interests --

00:17:17.156 --> 00:17:21.113
I rode horses with other kids,
I made model rockets with other kids,

00:17:21.137 --> 00:17:23.115
did electronics lab with other kids.

00:17:23.139 --> 00:17:27.390
And in the '60s, it was gluing mirrors
onto a rubber membrane on a speaker

00:17:27.414 --> 00:17:28.595
to make a light show.

00:17:28.619 --> 00:17:30.841
That was, like,
we considered that super cool.

00:17:30.865 --> 00:17:31.871
(Laughter)

00:17:31.895 --> 00:17:33.392
CA: Is it unrealistic for them

00:17:33.416 --> 00:17:38.156
to hope or think that that child
loves them, as some might, as most, wish?

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:40.414
TG: Well, I tell you,
that child will be loyal,

00:17:40.438 --> 00:17:43.813
and if your house is burning down,
they're going to get you out of it.

00:17:43.837 --> 00:17:47.496
CA: Wow. So most people, if you ask them
what they're most passionate about,

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.368
they'd say things like,
"My kids" or "My lover."

00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:52.762
What are you most passionate about?

00:17:52.786 --> 00:17:55.817
TG: I'm passionate
about that the things I do

00:17:55.841 --> 00:17:57.878
are going to make
the world a better place.

00:17:57.902 --> 00:18:00.124
When I have a mother
of an autistic child say,

00:18:00.148 --> 00:18:02.210
"My kid went to college
because of your book

00:18:02.234 --> 00:18:03.434
or one of your lectures,"

00:18:03.458 --> 00:18:04.609
that makes me happy.

00:18:04.633 --> 00:18:07.346
You know, the slaughter plants
I worked with in the '80s;

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:08.687
they were absolutely awful.

00:18:08.711 --> 00:18:11.987
I developed a really simple
scoring system for slaughter plants,

00:18:12.011 --> 00:18:13.563
where you just measure outcomes:

00:18:13.587 --> 00:18:14.829
How many cattle fell down?

00:18:14.853 --> 00:18:16.601
How many got poked with the prodder?

00:18:16.625 --> 00:18:18.656
How many cattle
are mooing their heads off?

00:18:19.018 --> 00:18:20.352
And it's very, very simple.

00:18:20.376 --> 00:18:22.353
You directly observe a few simple things.

00:18:22.377 --> 00:18:23.541
It's worked really well.

00:18:23.565 --> 00:18:25.904
I get satisfaction out of seeing stuff

00:18:25.928 --> 00:18:28.648
that makes real change in the real world.

00:18:28.672 --> 00:18:31.421
We need a lot more of that,
and a lot less abstract stuff.

00:18:31.445 --> 00:18:32.596
CA: Totally.

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:37.703
(Applause)

00:18:37.727 --> 00:18:40.826
CA: When we were talking on the phone,
one of the things you said

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:42.052
that really astonished me

00:18:42.076 --> 00:18:45.237
was that one thing you were passionate
about was server farms.

00:18:45.843 --> 00:18:46.994
Tell me about that.

00:18:47.018 --> 00:18:50.395
TG: Well, the reason why I got really
excited when I read about that,

00:18:50.419 --> 00:18:52.075
it contains knowledge.

00:18:52.099 --> 00:18:53.757
It's libraries.

00:18:53.781 --> 00:18:57.300
And to me, knowledge is something
that is extremely valuable.

00:18:57.324 --> 00:19:00.440
So, maybe over 10 years ago
now, our library got flooded.

00:19:00.464 --> 00:19:02.515
This is before the Internet
got really big.

00:19:02.539 --> 00:19:05.220
And I was really upset
about all the books being wrecked,

00:19:05.244 --> 00:19:07.220
because it was knowledge being destroyed.

00:19:07.244 --> 00:19:11.657
And server farms, or data centers,
are great libraries of knowledge.

00:19:11.681 --> 00:19:12.972
CA: Temple, can I just say,

00:19:12.996 --> 00:19:15.082
it's an absolute delight
to have you at TED.

00:19:15.106 --> 00:19:16.257
Thank you so much.

00:19:16.281 --> 00:19:18.176
TG: Well, thank you so much. Thank you.

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:23.436
(Applause)
