00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
If you are a blind child in India,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
you will very likely have to contend with

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
at least two big pieces of bad news.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The first bad news

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
is that the chances of getting treatment

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
are extremely slim to none,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and that's because most of the blindness

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
alleviation programs in the country

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
are focused on adults,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and there are very, very few hospitals

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
that are actually equipped to treat children.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
In fact, if you were to be treated,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
you might well end up being treated

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
by a person who has no medical credentials

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
as this case from Rajasthan illustrates.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
This is a three-year-old orphan girl

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
who had cataracts.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
So, her caretakers took her

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
to the village medicine man,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and instead of suggesting to the caretakers

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
that the girl be taken to a hospital,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
the person decided to burn her abdomen

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
with red-hot iron bars

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
to drive out the demons.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
The second piece of bad news

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
will be delivered to you

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
by neuroscientists, who will tell you

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
that if you are older than four or five years of age,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
that even if you have your eye corrected,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
the chances of your brain learning how to see

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
are very, very slim --

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
again, slim or none.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
So when I heard these two things,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
it troubled me deeply,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
both because of personal reasons

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and scientific reasons.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So let me first start with the personal reason.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
It'll sound corny, but it's sincere.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
That's my son, Darius.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
As a new father,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
I have a qualitatively different sense

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
of just how delicate babies are,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
what our obligations are towards them

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and how much love

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
we can feel towards a child.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I would move heaven and earth

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
in order to get treatment for Darius,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and for me to be told

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
that there might be other Dariuses

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
who are not getting treatment,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
that's just viscerally wrong.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
So that's the personal reason.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Scientific reason is that this notion

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
from neuroscience of critical periods --

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
that if the brain is older

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
than four or five years of age,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
it loses its ability to learn --

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
that doesn't sit well with me,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
because I don't think that idea

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
has been tested adequately.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
The birth of the idea is from

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel's work,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
two researchers who were at Harvard,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and they got the Nobel Prize in 1981

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
for their studies of visual physiology,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
which are remarkably beautiful studies,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
but I believe some of their work

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
has been extrapolated

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
into the human domain prematurely.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
So, they did their work with kittens,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
with different kinds of deprivation regiments,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and those studies,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
which date back to the '60s,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
are now being applied to human children.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
So I felt that I needed to do two things.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
One: provide care

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
to children who are currently

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
being deprived of treatment.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
That's the humanitarian mission.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
And the scientific mission would be

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
to test the limits

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
of visual plasticity.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And these two missions, as you can tell,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
thread together perfectly. One adds to the other;

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
in fact, one would be impossible without the other.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
So, to implement

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
these twin missions,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
a few years ago, I launched Project Prakash.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Prakash, as many of you know,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
is the Sanskrit word for light,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and the idea is that

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
in bringing light into the lives of children,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
we also have a chance

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
of shedding light on some of the

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
deepest mysteries of neuroscience.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And the logo -- even though it looks extremely Irish,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
it's actually derived from

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
the Indian symbol of Diya, an earthen lamp.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
The Prakash, the overall effort

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
has three components:

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
outreach, to identify children in need of care;

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
medical treatment; and in subsequent study.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And I want to show you a short video clip

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
that illustrates the first two components of this work.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
This is an outreach station

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
conducted at a school for the blind.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
(Text: Most of the children are profoundly and permanently blind ...)

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Pawan Sinha: So, because this is a school for the blind,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
many children have permanent conditions.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
That's a case of microphthalmos,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
which is malformed eyes,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
and that's a permanent condition;

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
it cannot be treated.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
That's an extreme of micropthalmos

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
called enophthalmos.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
But, every so often, we come across children

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
who show some residual vision,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
and that is a very good sign

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
that the condition might actually be treatable.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
So, after that screening, we bring the children to the hospital.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
That's the hospital we're working with in Delhi,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
the Schroff Charity Eye Hospital.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
It has a very well-equipped

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
pediatric ophthalmic center,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
which was made possible in part

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
by a gift from the Ronald McDonald charity.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
So, eating burgers actually helps.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
(Text: Such examinations allow us to improve

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
eye-health in many children, and ...

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
... help us find children who can participate in Project Prakash.)

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
PS: So, as I zoom in to the eyes of this child,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
you will see the cause of his blindness.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
The whites that you see in the middle of his pupils

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
are congenital cataracts,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
so opacities of the lens.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
In our eyes, the lens is clear,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
but in this child, the lens has become opaque,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
and therefore he can't see the world.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
So, the child is given treatment. You'll see shots of the eye.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Here's the eye with the opaque lens,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
the opaque lens extracted

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
and an acrylic lens inserted.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
And here's the same child

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
three weeks post-operation,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
with the right eye open.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000
(Applause)

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Thank you.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
So, even from that little clip, you can begin to get the sense

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
that recovery is possible,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
and we have now

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
provided treatment to over 200 children,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
and the story repeats itself.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
After treatment, the child

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
gains significant functionality.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
In fact, the story holds true

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
even if you have a person who got sight

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
after several years of deprivation.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
We did a paper a few years ago

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000
about this woman that you see on the right, SRD,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
and she got her sight late in life,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
and her vision is remarkable at this age.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
I should add a tragic postscript to this --

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
she died two years ago

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
in a bus accident.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
So, hers is just a truly inspiring story --

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
unknown, but inspiring story.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
So when we started finding these results,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
as you might imagine, it created quite a bit of stir

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
in the scientific and the popular press.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Here's an article in Nature

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
that profiled this work,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
and another one in Time.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
So, we were fairly convinced -- we are convinced --

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
that recovery is feasible,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
despite extended visual deprivation.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
The next obvious question to ask:

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
What is the process of recovery?

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
So, the way we study that is,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
let's say we find a child who has light sensitivity.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
The child is provided treatment,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
and I want to stress that the treatment

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
is completely unconditional;

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
there is no quid pro quo.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
We treat many more children then we actually work with.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Every child who needs treatment is treated.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
After treatment, about every week,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
we run the child

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
on a battery of simple visual tests

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
in order to see how their visual skills

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
are coming on line.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And we try to do this for as long as possible.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
This arc of development

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
gives us unprecedented

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
and extremely valuable information

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
about how the scaffolding of vision

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
gets set up.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
What might be the causal connections

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
between the early developing skills

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
and the later developing ones?

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And we've used this general approach to study

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
many different visual proficiencies,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000
but I want to highlight one particular one,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
and that is image parsing into objects.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
So, any image of the kind that you see on the left,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
be it a real image or a synthetic image,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
it's made up of little regions

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
that you see in the middle column,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
regions of different colors, different luminances.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
The brain has this complex task

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
of putting together, integrating,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
subsets of these regions

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
into something that's more meaningful,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
into what we would consider to be objects,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
as you see on the right.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
And nobody knows how this integration happens,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
and that's the question we asked with Project Prakash.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
So, here's what happens

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
very soon after the onset of sight.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Here's a person who had gained sight just a couple of weeks ago,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
and you see Ethan Myers, a graduate student from MIT,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
running the experiment with him.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
His visual-motor coordination is quite poor,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
but you get a general sense

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
of what are the regions that he's trying to trace out.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
If you show him real world images,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
if you show others like him real world images,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
they are unable to recognize most of the objects

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
because the world to them is over-fragmented;

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
it's made up of a collage, a patchwork,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
of regions of different colors and luminances.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
And that's what's indicated in the green outlines.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
When you ask them,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
"Even if you can't name the objects, just point to where the objects are,"

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
these are the regions that they point to.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
So the world is this complex

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
patchwork of regions.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Even the shadow on the ball

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
becomes its own object.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Interestingly enough,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
you give them a few months,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
and this is what happens.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Doctor: How many are these?

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Patient: These are two things.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Doctor: What are their shapes?

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Patient: Their shapes ...

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
This one is a circle,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
and this

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
is a square.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
PS: A very dramatic transformation has come about.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
And the question is:

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
What underlies this transformation?

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
It's a profound question,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
and what's even more amazing is how simple

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
the answer is.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
The answer lies in motion

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
and that's what I want to show you in the next clip.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Doctor: What shape do you see here?

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Patient: I can't make it out.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Doctor: Now?

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Patient: Triangle.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Doctor: How many things are these?

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Now, how many things are these?

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Patient: Two.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Doctor: What are these things?

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Patient: A square and a circle.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
PS: And we see this pattern over and over again.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
The one thing the visual system needs

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
in order to begin parsing the world

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
is dynamic information.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
So the inference we are deriving from this,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
and several such experiments,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
is that dynamic information processing,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
or motion processing,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
serves as the bedrock for building

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
the rest of the complexity of visual processing;

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
it leads to visual integration

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
and eventually to recognition.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
This simple idea has far reaching implications.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
And let me just quickly mention two,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
one, drawing from the domain of engineering,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
and one from the clinic.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
So, from the perspective of engineering,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
we can ask: Goven that we know

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
that motion is so important for the human visual system,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
can we use this as a recipe

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
for constructing machine-based vision systems

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
that can learn on their own, that don't need to be programmed

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
by a human programmer?

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
And that's what we're trying to do.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
I'm at MIT, at MIT you need to apply

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
whatever basic knowledge you gain.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
So we are creating Dylan,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
which is a computational system

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
with an ambitious goal

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
of taking in visual inputs

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
of the same kind that a human child would receive,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
and autonomously discovering:

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
What are the objects in this visual input?

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
So, don't worry about the internals of Dylan.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Here, I'm just going to talk about

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
how we test Dylan.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
The way we test Dylan is by giving it

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
inputs, as I said, of the same kind

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
that a baby, or a child in Project Prakash would get.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
But for a long time we couldn't quite figure out:

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Wow can we get these kinds of video inputs?

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
So, I thought,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
could we have Darius

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
serve as our babycam carrier,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
and that way get the inputs that we feed into Dylan?

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
So that's what we did.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:45.000
(Laughter)

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
I had to have long conversations with my wife.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000
(Laughter)

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
In fact, Pam, if you're watching this,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
please forgive me.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
So, we modified the optics of the camera

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
in order to mimic the baby's visual acuity.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
As some of you might know,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
babyies are born pretty much legally blind.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Their acuity -- our acuity is 20/20;

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
babies' acuity is like 20/800,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
so they are looking at the world

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
in a very, very blurry fashion.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Here's what a baby-cam video looks like.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:35.000
(Laughter)

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
(Applause)

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Thankfully, there isn't any audio

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
to go with this.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
What's amazing is that working with such

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
highly degraded input,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
the baby, very quickly, is able

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
to discover meaning in such input.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
But then two or three days afterward,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
babies begin to pay attention

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
to their mother's or their father's face.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
How does that happen? We want Dylan to be able to do that,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
and using this mantra of motion,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Dylan actually can do that.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
So, given that kind of video input,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
with just about six or seven minutes worth of video,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Dylan can begin to extract patterns

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
that include faces.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
So, it's an important demonstration

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
of the power of motion.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
The clinical implication, it comes from the domain of autism.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Visual integration has been associated with autism

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
by several researchers.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
When we saw that, we asked:

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Could the impairment in visual integration

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
be the manifestation of something underneath,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
of dynamic information processing deficiencies in autism?

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Because, if that hypothesis were to be true,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
it would have massive repercussions in our understanding

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
of what's causing the many different aspects

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
of the autism phenotype.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
What you're going to see are

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
video clips of two children -- one neurotypical,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
one with autism, playing Pong.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
So, while the child is playing Pong, we are tracking where they're looking.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
In red are the eye movement traces.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
This is the neurotypical child, and what you see

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
is that the child is able to make cues

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
of the dynamic information

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
to predict where the ball is going to go.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Even before the ball gets to a place,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
the child is already looking there.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Contrast this with a child

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
with autism playing the same game.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Instead of anticipating,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
the child always follows where the ball has been.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
The efficiency of the use

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
of dynamic information

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
seems to be significantly compromised in autism.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
So we are pursuing this line of work

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
and hopefully we'll have

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
more results to report soon.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Looking ahead, if you think of this disk

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
as representing all of the children

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
we've treated so far,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
this is the magnitude of the problem.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
The red dots are the children we have not treated.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
So, there are many, many more children who need to be treated,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
and in order to expand the scope of the project,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
we are planning on launching

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
The Prakash Center for Children,

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
which will have a dedicated pediatric hospital,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
a school for the children we are treating

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
and also a cutting-edge research facility.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
The Prakash Center will integrate health care,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
education and research in a way

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
that truly creates the whole

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
to be greater than the sum of the parts.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
So, to summarize: Prakash, in its five years of existence,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
it's had an impact in multiple areas,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
ranging from basic neuroscience

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
plasticity and learning in the brain,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
to clinically relevant hypotheses like in autism,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
the development of autonomous machine vision systems,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
education of the undergraduate and graduate students,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
and most importantly in the alleviation

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
of childhood blindness.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
And for my students and I, it's been

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
just a phenomenal experience

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
because we have gotten to do interesting research,

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
while at the same time

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
helping the many children that we have worked with.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Thank you very much.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
(Applause)
