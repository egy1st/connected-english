00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I think it was in my second grade that I was caught

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
drawing the bust of a nude by Michelangelo.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I was sent straight away to my school principal,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and my school principal, a sweet nun,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
looked at my book with disgust,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
flipped through the pages, saw all the nudes --

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
you know, I'd been seeing my mother draw nudes and I'd copy her --

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and the nun slapped me on my face and said,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
"Sweet Jesus, this kid has already begun."

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I had no clue what she was talking about,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
but it was convincing enough for me never to draw again

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
until the ninth grade.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Thanks to a really boring lecture,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I started caricaturing my teachers in school.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And, you know, I got a lot of popularity.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I don't play sports. I'm really bad at sports.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I don't have the fanciest gadgets at home.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I'm not on top of the class.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
So for me, cartooning gave me a sense of identity.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I got popular, but I was scared I'd get caught again.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So what I did was I quickly put together

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
a collage of all the teachers I had drawn,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
glorified my school principal, put him right on top,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and gifted it to him.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
He had a good laugh at the other teachers

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and put it up on the notice board.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
(Laughter)

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
This is a part of that.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And I became a school hero.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
All my seniors knew me. I felt really special.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I have to tell you a little bit about my family.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
That's my mother. I love her to bits.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
She's the one who taught me how to draw and, more importantly, how to love.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
She's a bit of a hippie.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
She said, "Don't say that," but I'm saying it anyway.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
The rest of my family are boring academics,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
busy collecting Ivy League decals for our classic Ambassador car.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
My father's a little different.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
My father believed in a holistic approach to living,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and, you know, every time he taught us,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
he'd say, "I hate these books,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
because these books are hijacked by Industrial Revolution."

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
While he still held that worldview, I was 16,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I got the best lawyer in town,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
my older brother Karthik,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and I sat him down, and I said, "Pa,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
from today onwards I've decided

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I'm going to be disciplined,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I'm going to be curious,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I'm going to learn something new every day,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I'm going to be very hard working,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and I'm not going to depend on you

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
emotionally or financially."

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And he was very impressed. He was all tearing up. Ready to hug me.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
And I said, "Hold that thought."

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I said, "Can I quit school then?"

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
But, to cut a long story short,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I quit school to pursue a career as a cartoonist.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I must have done about 30,000 caricatures.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I would do birthday parties, weddings, divorces,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
anything for anyone who wanted to use my services.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
But, most importantly, while I was traveling,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I taught children cartooning,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and in exchange, I learned how to be spontaneous.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And mad and crazy and fun.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
When I started teaching them, I said let me start doing this professionally.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
When I was 18 I started my own school.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
However, an 18 year-old trying to start a school

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
is not easy unless you have a big patron

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
or a big supporter.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So I was flipping through the pages of the Times of India

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
when I saw that the Prime Minister of India

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
was visiting my home town, Bangalore.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
And, you know, just like how

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
every cartoonist knows Bush here,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
and if you had to meet Bush,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
it would be the funnest thing because

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
his face was a cartoonist's delight.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
I had to meet my Prime Minister.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
I went to the place where

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
his helicopter was about to land.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
I saw layers of security.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
I caricatured my way through three layers

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
by just impressing the guards,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
but I got stuck. I got stuck at the third.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And what happened was, to my luck,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
I saw a nuclear scientist

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
at whose party I had done cartoons.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
I ran up to him, and said, "Hello, sir. How do you do?"

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
He said, "What are you doing here, Raghava?"

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
I said, "I'm here to meet the Prime Minister."

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
He said, "Oh, so am I."

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
I hopped into his car, and off we went

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
through the remaining layers of security.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
(Applause)

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Thank you.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
I sat him down, I caricatured him,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
and since then I've caricatured hundreds of celebrities.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
This is one I remember fondly.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Salman Rushdie was pissed-off I think

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
because I altered the map of New York, if you notice.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
(Laughter)

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Anyway, the next slide I'm about to show you --

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
(Laughter)

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Should I just turn that off?

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
The next slide I'm about to show you,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
is a little more serious.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
I was hesitant to include this in my presentation

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
because this cartoon was published

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
soon after 9/11.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
What was, for me, a very naive observation,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
turned out to be a disaster.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
That evening, I came home to hundreds of hate mails,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
hundreds of people telling me how they

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
could have lived another day without seeing this.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
I was also asked to leave the organization,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
a cartoonists' organization in America,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
that for me was my lifeline.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
That's when I realized, you know, cartoons are really powerful,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
art comes with responsibility.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Anyway, what I did was I decided

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
that I need to take a break.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
I quit my job at the papers, I closed my school,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
and I wrapped up my pencils and my brushes and inks,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and I decided to go traveling.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
When I went traveling, I remember,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
I met this fabulous old man,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
who I met when I was caricaturing,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
who turned out to be an artist, in Italy.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
He invited me to his studio. He said, "Come and visit."

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
When I went, I saw the ghastliest thing ever.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
I saw this dead, naked effigy of himself

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
hanging from the ceiling.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
I said, "Oh, my God. What is that?"

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And I asked him, and he said,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
"Oh, that thing? In the night, I die.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
In the morning, I am born again."

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
I thought he was koo koo,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
but something about that really stuck.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
I loved it. I thought there was something really beautiful about that.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
So I said, "I am dead, so I need to be born again."

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
So, I wanted to be a painter like him,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
except, I don't know how to paint.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
So, I tried going to the art store.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
You know, there are a hundred types of brushes.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Forget it, they will confuse you

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
even if you know how to draw.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
So I decided, I'm going to learn to paint by myself.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
I'm going to show you a very quick clip

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
to show you how I painted and a little bit

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
about my city, Bangalore.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:42.000
(Music)

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
They had to be larger than life.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Everything had to be larger. The next painting was even bigger.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And even bigger.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And for me it was, I had to dance while I painted.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
It was so exciting.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Except, I even started painting dancers.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Here for example is a Flamenco dancer,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
except there was one problem.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
I didn't know the dance form, so I started following them,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
and I made some money,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
sold my paintings and would rush off

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
to France or Spain and work with them.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
That's Pepe Linares, the renowned Flamenco singer.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
But I had one problem, my paintings never danced.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
As much energy as I put into them

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
while making them, they never danced.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
So I decided -- I had this crazy epiphany at two in the morning.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
I called my friends, painted on their bodies,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
and had them dance in front of a painting.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
And, all of a sudden, my paintings came alive.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
And then I was fortunate enough

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
to actually perform this in California with Velocity Circus.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
And I sat like you guys there in the audience.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
And I saw my work come alive.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
You know, normally you work in isolation,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
and you show at a gallery,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
but here, the work was coming alive,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
and it had some other artists working with me.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
The collaborative effort was fabulous.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
I said, I'm going to collaborate with anybody and everybody I meet.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
I started doing fashion.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
This is a fashion show we held in London.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
The best collaboration, of course, is with children.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
They are ruthless, they are honest,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
but they're full of energy and fun.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000
This is a work, a library I designed for the Robin Hood Foundation.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
And I must say, I spent time in the Bronx

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
working with these kids.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
And, in exchange for me working with them,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
they taught me how to be cool.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
I don't think I've succeeded, but they've taught me.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
They said, "Stop saying sorry. Say, my bad."

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
(Laughter)

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Then I said, all this is good,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
but I want to paint like a real painter.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
American education is so expensive.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
I was in India, and I was walking down the streets,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
and I saw a billboard painter.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
And these guys paint humongous paintings,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
and they look really good.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
And I wondered how they did it from so close.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
So, one day I had the opportunity to meet one of these guys,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
and I said, "How do you paint like that? Who taught you?"

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
And he said, "Oh, it's very easy. I can teach you,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
but we're leaving the city,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
because billboard painters are a dying,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
extinct bunch of artists,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
because digital printing has totally replaced them and hijacked them."

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
I said, in exchange for education in how to paint,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
I will support them, and I started a company.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And since then, I've been painting all over the place.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
This is a painting I did of my wife in my apartment.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
This is another painting.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
And, in fact, I started painting on anything,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
and started sending them around town.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Since I mentioned my wife, the most important collaboration

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
has been with her, Netra.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Netra and I met when she was 18.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
I must have been 19 and a half then,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
and it was love at first sight.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
I lived in India. She lived in America.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
She'd come every two months to visit me,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
and then I said I'm the man,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
I'm the man, and I have to reciprocate.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
I have to travel seven oceans, and I have to come and see you.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
I did that twice, and I went broke.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
So then I said, "Nets, what do I do?"

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
She said, "Why don't you send me your paintings?

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
My dad knows a bunch of rich guys.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
We'll try and con them into buying it,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
and then..."

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
But it turned out, after I sent the works to her,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
that her dad's friends,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
like most of you, are geeks.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
I'm joking.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
(Laughter)

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
No, they were really big geeks,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
and they didn't know much about art.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
So Netra was stuck with 30 paintings of mine.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
So what we did was we rented a little van

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000
and we drove all over the east coast trying to sell it.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
She contacted anyone and everyone

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
who was willing to buy my work.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
She made enough money, she sold off the whole collection

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
and made enough money to move me for four years

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
with lawyers, a company, everything,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
and she became my manager.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
That's us in New York.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Notice one thing,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
we're equal here.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Something happened along the line.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
(Laughter)

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
But this brought me -- with Netra managing my career --

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
it brought me a lot of success.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
I was really happy. I thought of myself as a bit of a rockstar.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
I loved the attention.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
This is all the press we got, and we said,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
it's time to celebrate.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
And I said that the best way to celebrate is to marry Netra.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
I said, "Let's get married."

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
And I said, "Not just married. Let's invite everyone who's helped us,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
all the people who bought our work."

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
And you won't believe it, we put together a list of 7,000 people,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
who had made a difference -- a ridiculous list,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
but I was determined to bring them to India, so --

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
a lot of them were in India.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
150 artists volunteered to help me with my wedding.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
We had fashion designers, installation artists,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
models, we had makeup artists, jewelry designers,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
all kinds of people working with me

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
to make my wedding an art installation.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
And I had a special installation in tribute to my in-laws.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
I had the vegetable carvers work on that for me.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
But all this excitement led

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
to the press writing about us.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
We were in the papers, we're still in the news three years later,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
but, unfortunately, something tragic happened right after.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
My mother fell very ill.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
I love my mother

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
and I was told all of a sudden that she was going to die.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
And they said you have to say bye to her,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
you have to do what you have to do.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
And I was devastated.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
I had shows booked up for another year.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
I was on a high.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
And I couldn't. I could not.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
My life was not exuberant.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
I could not live this larger than life person.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
I started exploring the darker abscesses of the human mind.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Of course, my work turned ugly,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
but another thing happened.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
I lost all my audiences.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
The Bollywood stars who I would party with

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
and buy my work disappeared.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
The collectors, the friends, the press,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
everyone said, "Nice, but thank you."

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
"No thank you," was more like it.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
But I wanted people to actually

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
feel my work from their gut,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
because I was painting it from my gut.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
If they wanted beauty,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
I said, this is the beauty I'm willing to give you. It's politicized.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Of course, none of them liked it.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000
My works also turned autobiographical.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
At this point, something else happened.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
A very, very dear friend of mine

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
came out of the closet,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
and in India at that time, it was illegal to be gay,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
and it's disgusting to see how people respond to a gay person.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
I was very upset.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
I remember the time when my mother used to dress me up

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
as a little girl -- that's me there --

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
because she wanted a girl, and she has only boys.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:56.000
(Laughter)

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Anyway, I don't know what my friends are going to say after this talk.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
It's a secret.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:08.000
So, after this, my works turned a little violent.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
I talked about this masculinity that one need not perform.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
And I talked about the weakness of male sexuality.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
This time, not only did my collectors disappear,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
the political activists decided to ban me

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
and to threaten me

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
and to forbid me from showing.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
It turned nasty, and I'm a bit of a chicken.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
I can't deal with any threat. This was a big threat.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
So, I decided it was time

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
to end and go back home.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
This time I said let's try something different.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
I need to be reborn again.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
And I thought the best way, as most of you know who have children,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
the best way to have a new lease on life,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
is to have a child.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
I decided to have a child,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
and before I did that, I quickly studied what can go wrong.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
How can a family get dysfunctional?

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
And Rudra was born.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
That's my little son.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
And two magical things happened after he was born.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
My mother miraculously recovered

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
after a serious operation,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
and this man was elected president of this country.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
You know I sat at home and I watched.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
I teared up and I said that's where I want to be.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
So Netra and I wound up our life,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
closed up everything we had,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
and we decided to move to New York.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
And this was just eight months ago.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
I moved back to New York, my work has changed.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Everything about my work has become more whimsical.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
This one is called "What the Fuck Was I Thinking?"

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
It talks about mental incest.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
You know, I may appear to be a very nice, clean, sweet boy.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
But I'm not. I'm capable of thinking anything.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
But I'm very civil in my action, I assure you.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
(Laughter)

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
These are just different cartoons.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
And, before I go, I want to tell you a little story.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
I was talking to mother and father this morning,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
and my dad said, "I know you have so much you want to say,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
but you have to talk about your work with children."

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
So I said, okay.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
I work with children all over the world,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
and that's an entirely different talk,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
but I want to leave you with one story

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
that really, really inspired me.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
I met Belinda when she was 16.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
I was 17.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
I was in Australia,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
and Belinda had cancer,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
and I was told she's not going to live very long.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
They, in fact, told me three weeks.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
I walk into her room, and there was a shy girl,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000
and she was bald, and she was trying to hide her baldness.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
I whipped out my pen, and I started drawing on her head

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
and I drew a crown for her.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
And then, we started talking, and we spent a lovely time --

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
I told her how I ended up in Australia,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
how I backpacked and who I conned, and how I got a ticket,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
and all the stories.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
And I drew it out for her.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
And then I left.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Belinda died

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:03.000
and within a few days of her death,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
they published a book for her,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
and she used my cartoon on the cover.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
And she wrote a little note, she said,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
"Hey Rags, thank you for the magic carpet ride around the world."

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
For me, my art is my magic carpet ride.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
I hope you will join me in this magic carpet ride,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
and touch children and be honest.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Thank you so much.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:33.000
(Applause)
