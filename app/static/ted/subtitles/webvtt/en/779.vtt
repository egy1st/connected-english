00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Everybody talks about happiness these days.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I had somebody count the number of books

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
with "happiness" in the title published in the last five years

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and they gave up after about 40, and there were many more.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
There is a huge wave of interest in happiness,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
among researchers.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
There is a lot of happiness coaching.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Everybody would like to make people happier.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
But in spite of all this flood of work,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
there are several cognitive traps

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
about happiness.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
This applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
because it turns out we're just as messed up as anybody else is.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The first of these traps

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
is a reluctance to admit complexity.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
It turns out that the word "happiness"

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
is just not a useful word anymore,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
because we apply it to too many different things.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I think there is one particular meaning to which we might restrict it,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
but by and large,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
this is something that we'll have to give up

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and we'll have to adopt the more complicated view

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
of what well-being is.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The second trap is a confusion between experience and memory;

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
basically, it's between being happy in your life,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and being happy about your life

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
or happy with your life.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And those are two very different concepts,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and they're both lumped in the notion of happiness.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And the third is the focusing illusion,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and it's the unfortunate fact that we can't think about any circumstance

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
that affects well-being

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
without distorting its importance.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I mean, this is a real cognitive trap.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
There's just no way of getting it right.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Now, I'd like to start with an example

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
of somebody who had a question-and-answer session

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
after one of my lectures reported a story,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and that was a story --

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
He said he'd been listening to a symphony,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and it was absolutely glorious music

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and at the very end of the recording,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
there was a dreadful screeching sound.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And then he added, really quite emotionally,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
it ruined the whole experience.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
But it hadn't.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
What it had ruined were the memories of the experience.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
He had had the experience.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
He had had 20 minutes of glorious music.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
They counted for nothing

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
because he was left with a memory;

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
the memory was ruined,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
What this is telling us, really,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
in terms of two selves.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
There is an experiencing self,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
who lives in the present

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and knows the present,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
is capable of re-living the past,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
but basically it has only the present.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
It's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches --

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000
you know, when the doctor asks,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
"Does it hurt now when I touch you here?"

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And then there is a remembering self,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
and the remembering self is the one that keeps score,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
and maintains the story of our life,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
and it's the one that the doctor approaches

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
in asking the question,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
"How have you been feeling lately?"

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
or "How was your trip to Albania?" or something like that.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Those are two very different entities,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
the experiencing self and the remembering self,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
and getting confused between them is part of the mess

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
about the notion of happiness.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Now, the remembering self

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
is a storyteller.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And that really starts with a basic response of our memories --

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
it starts immediately.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
We don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Our memory tells us stories,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
that is, what we get to keep from our experiences

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
is a story.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
And let me begin with one example.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
This is an old study.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
I won't go into detail. It's no longer painful these days,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
but it was painful when this study was run in the 1990s.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
They were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Here are two patients,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
those are their recordings.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
And you are asked, "Who of them suffered more?"

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
And it's a very easy question.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Clearly, Patient B suffered more --

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
his colonoscopy was longer,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
and every minute of pain that Patient A had,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Patient B had, and more.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
But now there is another question:

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
"How much did these patients think they suffered?"

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
And here is a surprise.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
The surprise is that Patient A

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
had a much worse memory of the colonoscopy

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
than Patient B.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
The stories of the colonoscopies were different,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000
and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
And neither of these stories is very inspiring or great --

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
but one of them is this distinct ... (Laughter)

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
but one of them is distinctly worse than the other.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And the one that is worse

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end;

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
it's a bad story.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
How do we know that?

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Because we asked these people after their colonoscopy,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000
and much later, too,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
"How bad was the whole thing, in total?"

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
And it was much worse for A than for B, in memory.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Now this is a direct conflict

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
between the experiencing self and the remembering self.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
From the point of view of the experiencing self,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
clearly, B had a worse time.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Now, what you could do with Patient A,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
and we actually ran clinical experiments,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
and it has been done, and it does work --

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000
you could actually extend the colonoscopy of Patient A

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
by just keeping the tube in without jiggling it too much.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
That will cause the patient

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
to suffer, but just a little

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
and much less than before.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
And if you do that for a couple of minutes,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
you have made the experiencing self

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
of Patient A worse off,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
and you have the remembering self of Patient A

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
a lot better off,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
because now you have endowed Patient A

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
with a better story

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
about his experience.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
What defines a story?

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And that is true of the stories

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
that memory delivers for us,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
and it's also true of the stories that we make up.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
What defines a story are changes,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
significant moments and endings.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Endings are very, very important

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
and, in this case, the ending dominated.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Now, the experiencing self

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
lives its life continuously.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
It has moments of experience, one after the other.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
And you can ask: What happens to these moments?

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
And the answer is really straightforward:

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
They are lost forever.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
I mean, most of the moments of our life --

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
and I calculated, you know, the psychological present

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
is said to be about three seconds long;

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
that means that, you know,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
in a life there are about 600 million of them;

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
in a month, there are about 600,000 --

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
most of them don't leave a trace.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Most of them are completely ignored

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
by the remembering self.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
And yet, somehow you get the sense

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
that they should count,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
that what happens during these moments of experience

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
is our life.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
It's the finite resource that we're spending

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
while we're on this earth.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
And how to spend it

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
would seem to be relevant,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
but that is not the story

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
that the remembering self keeps for us.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
So we have the remembering self

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
and the experiencing self,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
and they're really quite distinct.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
The biggest difference between them

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
is in the handling of time.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
From the point of view of the experiencing self,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
if you have a vacation,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
and the second week is just as good as the first,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
then the two-week vacation

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
is twice as good as the one-week vacation.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
That's not the way it works at all for the remembering self.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
For the remembering self, a two-week vacation

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
is barely better than the one-week vacation

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
because there are no new memories added.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
You have not changed the story.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And in this way,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
time is actually the critical variable

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
that distinguishes a remembering self

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
from an experiencing self;

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
time has very little impact on the story.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Now, the remembering self does more

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
than remember and tell stories.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
It is actually the one that makes decisions

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
because, if you have a patient who has had, say,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
two colonoscopies with two different surgeons

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
and is deciding which of them to choose,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
then the one that chooses

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
is the one that has the memory that is less bad,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
and that's the surgeon that will be chosen.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
The experiencing self

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
has no voice in this choice.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
We actually don't choose between experiences,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
we choose between memories of experiences.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
And even when we think about the future,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
we don't think of our future normally as experiences.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
We think of our future

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
as anticipated memories.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And basically you can look at this,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
you know, as a tyranny of the remembering self,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
and you can think of the remembering self

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
sort of dragging the experiencing self

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
through experiences that

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
the experiencing self doesn't need.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
I have that sense that

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
when we go on vacations

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
this is very frequently the case;

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
that is, we go on vacations,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
to a very large extent,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
in the service of our remembering self.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
And this is a bit hard to justify I think.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
I mean, how much do we consume our memories?

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
That is one of the explanations

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
that is given for the dominance

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
of the remembering self.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
And when I think about that, I think about a vacation

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
we had in Antarctica a few years ago,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
which was clearly the best vacation I've ever had,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
and I think of it relatively often,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
relative to how much I think of other vacations.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
And I probably have consumed

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
my memories of that three-week trip, I would say,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
for about 25 minutes in the last four years.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Now, if I had ever opened the folder

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
with the 600 pictures in it,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
I would have spent another hour.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Now, that is three weeks,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
and that is at most an hour and a half.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
There seems to be a discrepancy.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Now, I may be a bit extreme, you know,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
in how little appetite I have for consuming memories,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
but even if you do more of this,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
there is a genuine question:

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Why do we put so much weight on memory

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
relative to the weight that we put on experiences?

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
So I want you to think

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
about a thought experiment.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Imagine that for your next vacation,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
you know that at the end of the vacation

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
all your pictures will be destroyed,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
and you'll get an amnesic drug

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
so that you won't remember anything.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Now, would you choose the same vacation? (Laughter)

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
And if you would choose a different vacation,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
there is a conflict between your two selves,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
and it's actually not at all obvious, because

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
if you think in terms of time,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
then you get one answer,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
and if you think in terms of memories,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
you might get another answer.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Why do we pick the vacations we do

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
is a problem that confronts us

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
with a choice between the two selves.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Now, the two selves

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
bring up two notions of happiness.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
There are really two concepts of happiness

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
that we can apply, one per self.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000
So you can ask: How happy is the experiencing self?

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
And then you would ask: How happy are the moments

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
in the experiencing self's life?

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
And they're all -- happiness for moments

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
is a fairly complicated process.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
What are the emotions that can be measured?

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
And, by the way, now we are capable

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
of getting a pretty good idea

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
of the happiness of the experiencing self over time.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
If you ask for the happiness of the remembering self,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
it's a completely different thing.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
This is not about how happily a person lives.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
It is about how satisfied or pleased the person is

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
when that person thinks about her life.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Very different notion.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Anyone who doesn't distinguish those notions

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
is going to mess up the study of happiness,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
and I belong to a crowd of students of well-being,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
who've been messing up the study of happiness for a long time

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
in precisely this way.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
The distinction between the

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
happiness of the experiencing self

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
and the satisfaction of the remembering self

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
has been recognized in recent years,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
and there are now efforts to measure the two separately.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
The Gallup Organization has a world poll

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
where more than half a million people

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
have been asked questions

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
about what they think of their life

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
and about their experiences,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
and there have been other efforts along those lines.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
So in recent years, we have begun to learn

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
about the happiness of the two selves.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
And the main lesson I think that we have learned

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
is they are really different.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000
You can know how satisfied somebody is with their life,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
and that really doesn't teach you much

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
about how happily they're living their life,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
and vice versa.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Just to give you a sense of the correlation,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
the correlation is about .5.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
What that means is if you met somebody,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
and you were told, "Oh his father is six feet tall,"

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
how much would you know about his height?

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Well, you would know something about his height,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
but there's a lot of uncertainty.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
You have that much uncertainty.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
If I tell you that somebody ranked their life eight on a scale of ten,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
you have a lot of uncertainty

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
about how happy they are

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
with their experiencing self.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
So the correlation is low.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
We know something about what controls

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
satisfaction of the happiness self.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
We know that money is very important,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
goals are very important.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
We know that happiness is mainly

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
being satisfied with people that we like,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
spending time with people that we like.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
There are other pleasures, but this is dominant.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
So if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
you are going to end up

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
doing very different things.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
The bottom line of what I've said here

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
is that we really should not think of happiness

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
as a substitute for well-being.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
It is a completely different notion.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Now, very quickly,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
another reason we cannot think straight about happiness

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:07.000
is that we do not attend to the same things

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
when we think about life, and we actually live.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000
So, if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
you are not going to get to the correct answer.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
When you ask that question,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
you think people must be happier in California

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
if, say, you live in Ohio.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
(Laughter)

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
And what happens is

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
when you think about living in California,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
you are thinking of the contrast

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
between California and other places,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
and that contrast, say, is in climate.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Well, it turns out that climate

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
is not very important to the experiencing self

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
and it's not even very important to the reflective self

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
that decides how happy people are.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
But now, because the reflective self is in charge,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
you may end up -- some people may end up

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
moving to California.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
And it's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
to people who move to California in the hope of getting happier.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Well, their experiencing self

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
is not going to get happier.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
We know that.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
But one thing will happen: They will think they are happier,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
because, when they think about it,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
they'll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in Ohio,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
and they will feel they made the right decision.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
It is very difficult

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
to think straight about well-being,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
and I hope I have given you a sense

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
of how difficult it is.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Thank you.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
(Applause)

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Chris Anderson: Thank you. I've got a question for you.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Thank you so much.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Now, when we were on the phone a few weeks ago,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
came out of that Gallup survey.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Is that something you can share

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
since you do have a few moments left now?

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Daniel Kahneman: Sure.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
I think the most interesting result that we found in the Gallup survey

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
is a number, which we absolutely did not expect to find.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
We found that with respect to the happiness

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
of the experiencing self.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000
When we looked at how feelings,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
vary with income.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
And it turns out that, below an income

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
of 60,000 dollars a year, for Americans --

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
and that's a very large sample of Americans, like 600,000,

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
so it's a large representative sample --

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
below an income of 600,000 dollars a year...

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
CA: 60,000.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
DK: 60,000.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
(Laughter)

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000
60,000 dollars a year, people are unhappy,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
and they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Above that, we get an absolutely flat line.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
I mean I've rarely seen lines so flat.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Clearly, what is happening is

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
money does not buy you experiential happiness,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
but lack of money certainly buys you misery,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
and we can measure that misery

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
very, very clearly.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
In terms of the other self, the remembering self,

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
you get a different story.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
The more money you earn, the more satisfied you are.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
That does not hold for emotions.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
CA: But Danny, the whole American endeavor is about

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
If people took seriously that finding,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
I mean, it seems to turn upside down

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
everything we believe about, like for example,

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
taxation policy and so forth.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Is there any chance that politicians, that the country generally,

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
would take a finding like that seriously

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
and run public policy based on it?

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
DK: You know I think that there is recognition

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
of the role of happiness research in public policy.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
The recognition is going to be slow in the United States,

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
no question about that,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
but in the U.K., it is happening,

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
and in other countries it is happening.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
People are recognizing that they ought

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
to be thinking of happiness

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
when they think of public policy.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
It's going to take a while,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
and people are going to debate

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
whether they want to study experience happiness,

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
or whether they want to study life evaluation,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
so we need to have that debate fairly soon.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
How to enhance happiness

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000
goes very different ways depending on how you think,

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
and whether you think of the remembering self

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
or you think of the experiencing self.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
This is going to influence policy, I think, in years to come.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
In the United States, efforts are being made

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
to measure the experience happiness of the population.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000
This is going to be, I think, within the next decade or two,

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
part of national statistics.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
CA: Well, it seems to me that this issue will -- or at least should be --

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
the most interesting policy discussion to track

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
over the next few years.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
Thank you so much for inventing behavioral economics.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Thank you, Danny Kahneman.
