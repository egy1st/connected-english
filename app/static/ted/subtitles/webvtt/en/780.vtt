WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So, what I'm going to do is

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
just give you the latest episode of India's --

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
maybe the world's -- longest running soap opera,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
which is cricket.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And may it run forever, because it gives people like me a living.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It's got everything that you'd want a normal soap opera to want:

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
It's got love, joy, happiness,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
sadness, tears, laughter,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
lots of deceit, intrigue.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And like all good soaps, it jumps 20 years

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
when the audience interest changes.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And that's exactly what cricket has done.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It's jumped 20 years

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
into 20-over game.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And that's what I'm going to talk about,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
how a small change

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
leads to a very big revolution.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
But it wasn't always like that.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Cricket wasn't always this

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
speed-driven generations game.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
There was a time when you played cricket,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
you played timeless test matches,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
when you played on till the game got over.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And there was this game in March 1939

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
that started on the third of March

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and ended on the 14th of March.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And it only ended because the English cricketers

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
had to go from Durban to Cape Town,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
which is a two-hour train journey,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
to catch the ship that left on the 17th,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
because the next ship wasn't around for a long time.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
So, the match was ended in between.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And one of the English batsmen said, "You know what?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Another half an hour and we would have won."

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
(Laughter)

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Another half an hour after 12 days.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
There were two Sundays in between. But of course, Sundays are church days,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
so you don't play on Sundays. And one day it rained,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
so they all sat around making friends with each other.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
But there is a reason why India fell in love with cricket:

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
because we had about the same pace of life.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
(Laughter)

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
The Mahabharata was like that as well, wasn't it?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
You fought by day, then it was sunset,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
so everyone went back home.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And then you worked out your strategy,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and you came and fought the next day, and you went back home again.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
The only difference between the Mahabharata and our cricket was

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
that in cricket, everybody was alive to come back and fight the next day.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Princes patronize the game,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
not because they love the game,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
but because it was a means of ingratiating themselves

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
to the British rulers.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
But there is one other reason why India fell in love with cricket,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
which was, all you needed was a plank of wood

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and a rubber ball, and any number of people

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
could play it anywhere.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Take a look:

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
You could play it in the dump

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
with some rocks over there,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
you could play it in a little alley --

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
you couldn't hit square anywhere, because the bat hit the wall;

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
don't forget the air conditioning and the cable wires.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
(Laughter)

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
You could play it on the banks of the Ganges --

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
that's as clean as the Ganges has been for a long time.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Or you could play many games in one small patch of land,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
even if you didn't know which game you were actually in.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
(Laughter)

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
As you can see, you can play anywhere.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
But slowly the game moved on,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
you know, finally.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
You don't always have five days. So, we moved on,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and we started playing 50-over cricket.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And then an enormous accident took place.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
In Indian sport we don't make things happen,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
accidents happen and we're in the right place at the right time, sometimes.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And we won this World Cup in 1983.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And suddenly we fell in love with the 50-over game,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and we played it virtually every day.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
There was more 50-over cricket than anywhere.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
But there was another big date.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
1983 was when we won the World Cup.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
1991,'92, we found a finance minister

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and a prime minister

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
willing to let the world look at India,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
rather than be this great country of intrigue

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
and mystery in this closed country.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And so we allowed multinationals into India.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
We cut customs duties, we reduced import duties,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
and we got all the multinationals coming in,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
with multinational budgets,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
who looked at per-capita income

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
and got very excited about the possibilities in India,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
and were looking for a vehicle to reach every Indian.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
And there are only two vehicles in India -- one real, one scripted.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
The scripted one is what you see in the movies,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000
the real one was cricket.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
And so one of my friends sitting right here in front of me,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Ravi Dhariwal from Pepsi, decided he's going to take it

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
all over the world.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
And Pepsi was this big revolution, because they started taking cricket all over.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And so cricket started becoming big;

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
cricket started bringing riches in.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Television started covering cricket. For a long time

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
television said, "We won't cover cricket

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
unless you pay us to cover it."

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Then they said, "OK,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
the next rights are sold for 55 million dollars.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
The next rights are sold for 612 million dollars."

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
So, it's a bit of a curve, that.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And then another big accident happened in our cricket.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
England invented 20 overs cricket,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
and said, "The world must play 20 overs cricket."

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Just as England invented cricket, and made the rest of the world play it.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Thank God for them.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000
(Laughter)

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
And so, India had to go and play the T20 World Cup, you see.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
India didn't want to play the T20 World Cup.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
But we were forced to play it by an 8-1 margin.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And then something very dramatic happened.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
We got to the final, and then this moment,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
that will remain enshrined forever,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
for everybody, take a look.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
(Crowd cheering)

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
The Pakistani batsman trying to clear the fielder.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Announcer: And Zishan takes it! India wins!

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
What a match for a Twenty20 final.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
India, the world champions.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
(Cheering)

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
India, T20 champions.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
But what a game we had, M. S. Dhoni

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
got it right in the air, but Misbah-ul-Haq, what a player.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
A massive, massive success:

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000
India, the world TT champions.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Harsha Bhogle: Suddenly India discovered this power of 20-overs cricket.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
The accident, of course, there, was that the batsman

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
thought the bowler was bowling fast.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000
(Laughter)

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
If he had bowled fast, the ball would have gone where it was meant to go,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
but it didn't go. And we suddenly discovered

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
that we could be good at this game.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
And what it also did was

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
it led to a certain pride in the fact that India could be the best in the world.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
It was at a time when investment was coming in,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
India was feeling a little more confident about itself.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
And so there was a feeling that there was great pride

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
in what we can do.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
And thankfully for all of us,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
the English are very good at inventing things,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and then the gracious people that they are,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
they let the world become very good at it.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
(Laughter)

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
And so England invented T20 cricket,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
and allowed India to hijack it.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
It was not like reengineering that we do in medicine,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
we just took it straight away, as is.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
(Laughter)

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And so, we launched our own T20 league.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Six weeks, city versus city.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
It was a new thing for us. We had only ever supported our country --

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
the only two areas in which India was very proud about

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
their country, representing itself on the field.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
One was war, the Indian army, which we don't like to happen very often.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
The other was Indian cricket.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Now, suddenly we had to support city leagues.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
But the people getting into these city leagues

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
were people who were taking their cues from the West.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
America is a home of leagues. And they said,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
"Right, we'll build some glitzy leagues here in India."

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
But was India ready for it?

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Because cricket, for a long time in India was always organized.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
It was never promoted, it was never sold -- it was organized.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And look what they did with our beautiful, nice,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
simple family game.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
All of a sudden, you had that happening.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
(Music)

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
An opening ceremony to match every other.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
This was an India that was buying Corvettes. This was an India that was buying Jaguar.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
This was an India that was adding more mobile phones per month

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
than New Zealand's population twice over.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
So, it was a different India.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
But it was also a slightly more orthodox India

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
that was very happy to be modern,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
but didn't want to say that to people.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
And so, they were aghast when the cheerleaders arrived.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Everyone secretly watched them, but everyone claimed not to.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
(Music)

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
(Laughter)

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
The new owners of Indian cricket were not the old princes.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
They were not bureaucrats who were forced

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
into sport because they didn't actually love it;

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
these were people who ran serious companies.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
And so they started promoting cricket big time,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
started promoting clubs big time.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
And they've started promoting them with huge money behind it.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
I mean the IPL had 2.3 billion dollars

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
before a ball was bowled,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
1.6 billion dollars for television revenue over 10 years,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
and another 70 million dollars plus from all these franchises

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
that were putting in money. And then they had to appeal to their cities,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
but they had to do it like the West, right? Because we are setting up leagues.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
But what they were very good at doing

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
was making it very localized.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
So, just to give you an example of how they did it --

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
not Manchester United style promotion,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
but very Mumbai style promotion. Take a look.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
(Music)

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Of course, a lot of people said, "Maybe they dance better than they play."

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
(Laughter)

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
But that's all right. What it did also is it changed the way we looked at cricket.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
All along, if you wanted a young cricketer,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
you picked him up from the bylanes of your own little locality,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
your own city, and you were very proud

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
of the system that produced those cricketers.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Now, all of the sudden, if you were to bowl a shot --

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
if Mumbai were to bowl a shot, for example,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
they needn't go to Kalbadevi

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
or Shivaji Park or somewhere to source them,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
they could go to Trinidad.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
This was the new India, wasn't it? This was the new world,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
where you can source from anywhere

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
as long as you get the best product at the best price.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
And all of a sudden, Indian sport had awakened to the reality

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
that you can source the best product for the best price

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
anywhere in the world.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
So, the Mumbai Indians flew in Dwayne Bravo from Trinidad and Tobago,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
overnight. And when he had to go back to represent

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000
the West Indies, they asked him, "When do you have to reach?"

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
He said, "I have to be there by a certain time, so I have to leave today."

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
We said, "No, no, no. It's not about when you have to leave;

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
it's about when do you have to reach there?"

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
And so he said, "I've got to reach on date X."

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
And they said, "Fine, you play to date X, minus one."

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
So, he played in Hyderabad, went, straight after the game,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
went from the stadium to Hyderabad airport,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
sat in a private corporate jet -- first refueling in Portugal,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
second refueling in Brazil; he was in West Indies in time.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000
(Laughter)

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
Never would India have thought on this scale before.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Never would India have said, "I want a player to play

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
one game for me, and I will use a corporate jet

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
to send him all the way back to Kingston, Jamaica

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
to play a game."

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
And I just thought to myself,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
"Wow, we've arrived somewhere in the world, you know?

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
We have arrived somewhere. We are thinking big."

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
But what this also did was it started

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
marrying the two most important things in Indian cricket,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
which is cricket and the movies in Indian entertainment.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
There is cricket and the movies.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
And they came together because people in the movies

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
now started owning clubs.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
And so, people started going to the cricket to watch Preity Zinta.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
They started going to the cricket to watch Shah Rukh Khan.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And something very interesting happened.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
We started getting song and dance in Indian cricket.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
And so it started resembling the Indian movies more and more.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
And of course, if you were on Preity Zinta's team --

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
as you will see on the clip that follows -- if you did well,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
you got a hug from Preity Zinta.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
So that was the ultimate reason to do well. Take a look --

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
everyone's watching Preity Zinta.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
(Music)

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
And then of course there was Shah Rukh playing the Kolkata crowd.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
We'd all seen matches in Kolkata,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
but we'd never seen anything like this:

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Shah Rukh, with the Bengali song, getting the audiences all worked up

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
for Kolkata -- not for India, but for Kolkata.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
But take a look at this.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
(Music)

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
An Indian film star hugging a Pakistani cricketer

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
because they'd won in Kolkata.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Can you imagine?

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
And do you know what the Pakistani cricketer said?

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
(Applause)

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
"I wish I was playing for Preity Zinta's team."

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
(Laughter)

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
But I thought I'd take this opportunity --

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
there's a few people from Pakistan in here.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
I'm so happy that you're here

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
because I think we can show that we can both be together and be friends, right?

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
We can play cricket together, we can be friends.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
So thank you very much for coming, all of you from Pakistan.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
(Applause)

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
There was criticism too because they said,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
"Players are being bought and sold?

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Are they grain?

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Are they cattle?"

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Because we had this auction, you see.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
How do you fix a price for a player?

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
And so the auction that followed

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
literally had people saying,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
"Bang! so many million dollars for so-and-so player."

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
There it is.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
(Music)

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Auctioneer: Going at 1,500,000 dollars. Chennai.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Shane Warne sold for 450,000 dollars.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
HB: Suddenly, a game which earned its players 50 rupees a day --

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
so 250 rupees for a test match,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
but if you finish in four days you only got 200.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
The best Indian players who played every test match --

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
every one of the internationals, the top of the line players --

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
standard contracts are 220,000 dollars in a whole year.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Now they were getting 500,000 for six days' work.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Then Andrew Flintoff came by from England,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
he got one and a half million dollars, and he went back and said,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
"For four weeks, I'm earning more than Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
and I'm earning more than the footballers, wow."

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
And where was he earning it from? From a little club in India.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Could you have imagined that day would come?

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
One and a half million dollars for six weeks' work.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
That's not bad, is it?

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
So, at 2.3 billion dollars before the first ball was bowled.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
What India was doing, though, was benchmarking

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
itself against the best in the world,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
and it became a huge brand.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Lalit Modi was on the cover of Business Today.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
IPL became the biggest brand in India

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
and, because our elections, had to be moved to South Africa,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
and we had to start the tournament in three weeks.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Move a whole tournament to South Africa in three weeks.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
But we did it. You know why?

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Because no country works as slowly as we do

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
till three weeks before an event,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
and nobody works fast as we do in the last three weeks.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:08.000
(Applause)

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Our population, which for a long time we thought was a problem,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
suddenly became our biggest asset

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
because there were more people watching --

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
the huge consuming class --

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
everybody came to watch the cricket.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
We'd also made cricket the only sport in India,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
which is a pity, but in India every other sport

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
pushes cricket to become big,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
which is a bit of a tragedy of our times.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Now, this last minute before I go --

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
there's a couple of side effects of all this.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
For a long time, India was this country of poverty,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
dust, beggars,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
snake charmers, filth,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Delhi belly -- people heard Delhi belly stories before they came.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
And, all of a sudden, India was this land of opportunity.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Cricketers all over the world said,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
"You know, we love India. We love to play in India."

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
And that felt good, you know?

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
We said, "The dollar's quite powerful actually."

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Can you imagine, you've got the dollar on view

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
and there's no Delhi belly in there anymore.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
There's no filth, there's no beggars, all the snake charmers have vanished,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
everybody's gone. This tells you how the capitalist world rules.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Right so, finally,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
an English game that India usurped a little bit,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
but T20 is going to be the next missionary in the world.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
If you want to take the game around the world,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
it's got to be the shortest form of the game.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
You can't take a timeless test to China and sit through 14 days with no result in the end,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
or you can't take it all over the world.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
So that's what T20 is doing.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Hopefully, it'll make everyone richer, hopefully it'll make the game bigger

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
and hopefully it'll give cricket commentators more time in the business.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Thank you very much. Thank you.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
(Applause)
