00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
If I can leave you with one big idea today,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
it's that the whole of the data

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
in which we consume

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
is greater that the sum of the parts,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and instead of thinking about information overload,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
what I'd like you to think about is how

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
we can use information so that patterns pop

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So what we're looking at right here is a typical mortality chart

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
organized by age.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This tool that I'm using here is a little experiment.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
It's called Pivot, and with Pivot what I can do

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
is I can choose to filter in one particular cause of deaths -- say, accidents.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And, right away, I see there's a different pattern that emerges.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
This is because, in the mid-area here,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
people are at their most active,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and over here they're at their most frail.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We can step back out again

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and then reorganize the data by cause of death,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
seeing that circulatory diseases and cancer

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
are the usual suspects, but not for everyone.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
If we go ahead and we filter by age --

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
say 40 years or less --

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
we see that accidents are actually

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
the greatest cause that people have to be worried about.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And if you drill into that, it's especially the case for men.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So you get the idea

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
that viewing information, viewing data in this way,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
is a lot like swimming

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
in a living information info-graphic.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And if we can do this for raw data,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
why not do it for content as well?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So what we have right here

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
is the cover of every single Sports Illustrated

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
ever produced.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
It's all here; it's all on the web.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
You can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
With Pivot, you can drill into a decade.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
You can drill into a particular year.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
You can jump right into a specific issue.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
So I'm looking at this; I see the athletes

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
that have appeared in this issue, the sports.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I'm a Lance Armstrong fan, so I'll go ahead and I'll click on that,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
which reveals, for me, all the issues

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
in which Lance Armstrong's been a part of.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
(Applause)

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Now, if I want to just kind of take a peek at these,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I might think,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
"Well, what about taking a look at all of cycling?"

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
So I can step back, and expand on that.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And I see Greg LeMond now.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And so you get the idea that when you

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
navigate over information this way --

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
going narrower, broader,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
backing in, backing out --

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
you're not searching, you're not browsing.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
You're doing something that's actually a little bit different.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
It's in between, and we think it changes

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
the way information can be used.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
So I want to extrapolate on this idea a bit

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
with something that's a little bit crazy.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
What we're done here is we've taken every single Wikipedia page

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
and we reduced it down to a little summary.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
So the summary consists of just a little synopsis

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and an icon to indicate the topical area that it comes from.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I'm only showing the top 500

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
most popular Wikipedia pages right here.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
But even in this limited view,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
we can do a lot of things.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Right away, we get a sense of what are the topical domains

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
that are most popular on Wikipedia.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I'm going to go ahead and select government.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Now, having selected government,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I can now see that the Wikipedia categories

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
that most frequently correspond to that

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
are Time magazine People of the Year.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
So this is really important because this is an insight

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
that was not contained within any one Wikipedia page.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
It's only possible to see that insight

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
when you step back and look at all of them.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Looking at one of these particular summaries,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
I can then drill into the concept of

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Time magazine Person of the Year,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
bringing up all of them.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
So looking at these people,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I can see that the majority come from government;

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
some have come from natural sciences;

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
some, fewer still, have come from business --

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
there's my boss --

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and one has come from music.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And interestingly enough,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Bono is also a TED Prize winner.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
So we can go, jump, and take a look at all the TED Prize winners.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
So you see, we're navigating the web for the first time

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
as if it's actually a web, not from page-to-page,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
but at a higher level of abstraction.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And so I want to show you one other thing

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
that may catch you a little bit by surprise.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
I'm just showing the New York Times website here.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
So Pivot, this application --

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
I don't want to call it a browser; it's really not a browser,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
but you can view web pages with it --

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
and we bring that zoomable technology

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
to every single web page like this.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
So I can step back,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
pop right back into a specific section.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Now the reason why this is important is because,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
by virtue of just viewing web pages in this way,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
I can look at my entire browsing history

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
in the exact same way.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
So I can drill into what I've done

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
over specific time frames.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Here, in fact, is the state

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
of all the demo that I just gave.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
And I can sort of replay some stuff that I was looking at earlier today.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
And, if I want to step back and look at everything,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
I can slice and dice my history,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
perhaps by my search history --

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
here, I was doing some nepotistic searching,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
looking for Bing, over here for Live Labs Pivot.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And from these, I can drill into the web page

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
and just launch them again.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
It's one metaphor repurposed multiple times,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
and in each case it makes the whole greater

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
than the sum of the parts with the data.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
So right now, in this world,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
we think about data as being this curse.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
We talk about the curse of information overload.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
We talk about drowning in data.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
What if we can actually turn that upside down

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
and turn the web upside down,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
so that instead of navigating from one thing to the next,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
we get used to the habit of being able to go from many things to many things,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
and then being able to see the patterns

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
that were otherwise hidden?

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
If we can do that, then instead of being trapped in data,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
we might actually extract information.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And, instead of dealing just with information,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
we can tease out knowledge.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
And if we get the knowledge, then maybe even there's wisdom to be found.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
So with that, I thank you.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:00.000
(Applause)
