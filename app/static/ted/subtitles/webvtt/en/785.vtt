00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I grew up on a steady diet of science fiction.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
In high school, I took a bus to school

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
an hour each way every day.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And I was always absorbed in a book,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
science fiction book,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
which took my mind to other worlds,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and satisfied, in a narrative form,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
this insatiable sense of curiosity that I had.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And you know, that curiosity also manifested itself

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
in the fact that whenever I wasn't in school

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I was out in the woods,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
hiking and taking "samples" --

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water --

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and bringing it back, looking at it under the microscope.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
You know, I was a real science geek.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
But it was all about trying to understand the world,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
understand the limits of possibility.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And my love of science fiction

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
actually seemed mirrored in the world around me,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
because what was happening, this was in the late '60s,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
we were going to the moon,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
we were exploring the deep oceans.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Jacques Cousteau was coming into our living rooms

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
with his amazing specials that showed us

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
animals and places and a wondrous world

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
that we could never really have previously imagined.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So, that seemed to resonate

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
with the whole science fiction part of it.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And I was an artist.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I could draw. I could paint.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And I found that because there weren't video games

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and this saturation of CG movies and all of this

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
imagery in the media landscape,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I had to create these images in my head.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
You know, we all did, as kids having to

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
read a book, and through the author's description,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
put something on the movie screen in our heads.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And so, my response to this was to paint, to draw

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
alien creatures, alien worlds,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
robots, spaceships, all that stuff.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I was endlessly getting busted in math class

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
doodling behind the textbook.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
That was -- the creativity

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
had to find its outlet somehow.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And an interesting thing happened: The Jacques Cousteau shows

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
actually got me very excited about the fact that there was

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
an alien world right here on Earth.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I might not really go to an alien world

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
on a spaceship someday --

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
that seemed pretty darn unlikely.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
But that was a world I could really go to,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
right here on Earth, that was as rich and exotic

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
as anything that I had imagined

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
from reading these books.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
So, I decided I was going to become a scuba diver

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
at the age of 15.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And the only problem with that was that I lived

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
in a little village in Canada,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
600 miles from the nearest ocean.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
But I didn't let that daunt me.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I pestered my father until he finally found

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
a scuba class in Buffalo, New York,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
right across the border from where we live.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And I actually got certified

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
in a pool at a YMCA in the dead of winter

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
in Buffalo, New York.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And I didn't see the ocean, a real ocean,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
for another two years,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
until we moved to California.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Since then, in the intervening

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
40 years,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
I've spent about 3,000 hours underwater,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
and 500 hours of that was in submersibles.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And I've learned that that deep-ocean environment,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
and even the shallow oceans,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
are so rich with amazing life

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
that really is beyond our imagination.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Nature's imagination is so boundless

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
compared to our own

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
meager human imagination.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
I still, to this day, stand in absolute awe

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
of what I see when I make these dives.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And my love affair with the ocean is ongoing,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
and just as strong as it ever was.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
But when I chose a career as an adult,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
it was filmmaking.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And that seemed to be the best way to reconcile

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
this urge I had to tell stories

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
with my urges to create images.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And I was, as a kid, constantly drawing comic books, and so on.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
So, filmmaking was the way to put pictures and stories

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
together, and that made sense.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
And of course the stories that I chose to tell

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
were science fiction stories: "Terminator," "Aliens"

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
and "The Abyss."

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
And with "The Abyss," I was putting together my love

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
of underwater and diving with filmmaking.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
So, you know, merging the two passions.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Something interesting came out of "The Abyss,"

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
which was that to solve a specific narrative

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
problem on that film,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
which was to create this kind of liquid water creature,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000
we actually embraced computer generated animation, CG.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
And this resulted in the first soft-surface

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
character, CG animation

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
that was ever in a movie.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And even though the film didn't make any money --

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
barely broke even, I should say --

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
I witnessed something amazing, which is that the audience,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
the global audience, was mesmerized

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
by this apparent magic.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
You know, it's Arthur Clarke's law

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
They were seeing something magical.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
And so that got me very excited.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
And I thought, "Wow, this is something that needs to be embraced

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
into the cinematic art."

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
So, with "Terminator 2," which was my next film,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
we took that much farther.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Working with ILM, we created the liquid metal dude

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
in that film. The success hung in the balance

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
on whether that effect would work.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And it did, and we created magic again,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
and we had the same result with an audience --

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
although we did make a little more money on that one.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
So, drawing a line through those two dots

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
of experience

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
came to, "This is going to be a whole new world,"

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
this was a whole new world of creativity

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
for film artists.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
So, I started a company with Stan Winston,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
my good friend Stan Winston,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
who is the premier make-up and creature designer

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
at that time, and it was called Digital Domain.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
And the concept of the company was

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
that we would leapfrog past

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
the analog processes of optical printers and so on,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
and we would go right to digital production.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
And we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
But we found ourselves lagging in the mid '90s

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
in the creature and character design stuff

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
that we had actually founded the company to do.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
So, I wrote this piece called "Avatar,"

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
which was meant to absolutely push the envelope

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
of visual effects,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
of CG effects, beyond,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
with realistic human emotive characters

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
generated in CG,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
and the main characters would all be in CG,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
and the world would be in CG.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
And the envelope pushed back,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
and I was told by the folks at my company

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
that we weren't going to be able to do this for a while.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
So, I shelved it, and I made this other movie about a big ship that sinks.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
(Laughter)

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
You know, I went and pitched it to the studio as "'Romeo and Juliet' on a ship:

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
"It's going to be this epic romance,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
passionate film."

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Secretly, what I wanted to do was

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
I wanted to dive to the real wreck of "Titanic."

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
And that's why I made the movie.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
(Applause)

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
And that's the truth. Now, the studio didn't know that.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
But I convinced them. I said,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
"We're going to dive to the wreck. We're going to film it for real.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
We'll be using it in the opening of the film.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
It will be really important. It will be a great marketing hook."

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
And I talked them into funding an expedition.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
(Laughter)

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Sounds crazy. But this goes back to that theme

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
about your imagination creating a reality.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Because we actually created a reality where six months later,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
I find myself in a Russian submersible

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
two and a half miles down in the north Atlantic,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
looking at the real Titanic through a view port.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Not a movie, not HD -- for real.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
(Applause)

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Now, that blew my mind.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
And it took a lot of preparation, we had to build cameras

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
and lights and all kinds of things.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
But, it struck me how much

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
this dive, these deep dives,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
was like a space mission.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
You know, where it was highly technical,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
and it required enormous planning.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
You get in this capsule, you go down to this dark

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
hostile environment

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
where there is no hope of rescue

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
if you can't get back by yourself.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
And I thought like, "Wow. I'm like,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
living in a science fiction movie.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
This is really cool."

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
And so, I really got bitten by the bug of deep-ocean exploration.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Of course, the curiosity, the science component of it --

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
it was everything. It was adventure,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
it was curiosity, it was imagination.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
And it was an experience that

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Hollywood couldn't give me.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Because, you know, I could imagine a creature and we could

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
create a visual effect for it. But I couldn't imagine what I was seeing

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
out that window.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
As we did some of our subsequent expeditions,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
I was seeing creatures at hydrothermal vents

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
and sometimes things that I had never seen before,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
sometimes things that no one had seen before,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
that actually were not described by science

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
at the time that we saw them and imaged them.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
So, I was completely smitten by this,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
and had to do more.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
And so, I actually made a kind of curious decision.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
After the success of "Titanic,"

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
I said, "OK, I'm going to park my day job

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
as a Hollywood movie maker,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
and I'm going to go be a full-time explorer for a while."

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
And so, we started planning these

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
expeditions.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
And we wound up going to the Bismark,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
and exploring it with robotic vehicles.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
We went back to the Titanic wreck.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
We took little bots that we had created

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
that spooled a fiber optic.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
And the idea was to go in and do an interior

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000
survey of that ship, which had never been done.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Nobody had ever looked inside the wreck. They didn't have the means to do it,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
so we created technology to do it.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
So, you know, here I am now, on the deck

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
of Titanic, sitting in a submersible,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
and looking out at planks that look much like this,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
where I knew that the band had played.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
And I'm flying a little robotic vehicle

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
through the corridor of the ship.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
When I say, "I'm operating it,"

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
but my mind is in the vehicle.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
I felt like I was physically present

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
inside the shipwreck of Titanic.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
And it was the most surreal kind

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
of deja vu experience I've ever had,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
because I would know before I turned a corner

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
what was going to be there before the lights

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
of the vehicle actually revealed it,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
because I had walked the set for months

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
when we were making the movie.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
And the set was based as an exact replica

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
on the blueprints of the ship.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
So, it was this absolutely remarkable experience.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
And it really made me realize that

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
the telepresence experience --

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
that you actually can have these robotic avatars,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000
then your consciousness is injected into the vehicle,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
into this other form of existence.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
It was really, really quite profound.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
And it may be a little bit of a glimpse as to what might be happening

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
some decades out

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
as we start to have cyborg bodies

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
for exploration or for other means

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
in many sort of

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
post-human futures

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
that I can imagine,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
as a science fiction fan.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
So, having done these expeditions,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
and really beginning to appreciate what was down there,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
such as at the deep ocean vents

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
where we had these amazing, amazing animals --

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
they're basically aliens right here on Earth.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
They live in an environment of chemosynthesis.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
They don't survive on sunlight-based

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
system the way we do.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
And so, you're seeing animals that are living next to

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
a 500-degree-Centigrade

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
water plumes.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
You think they can't possibly exist.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
At the same time

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
I was getting very interested in space science as well --

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
again, it's the science fiction influence, as a kid.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
And I wound up getting involved with

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
the space community,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
really involved with NASA,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
sitting on the NASA advisory board,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
planning actual space missions,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
going to Russia, going through the pre-cosmonaut

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
biomedical protocols,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
and all these sorts of things,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
to actually go and fly to the international space station

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
with our 3D camera systems.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
And this was fascinating.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
But what I wound up doing was bringing space scientists

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
with us into the deep.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
And taking them down so that they had access --

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
astrobiologists, planetary scientists,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
people who were interested in these extreme environments --

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
taking them down to the vents, and letting them see,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
and take samples and test instruments, and so on.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
So, here we were making documentary films,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
but actually doing science,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
and actually doing space science.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
I'd completely closed the loop

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
between being the science fiction fan,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
you know, as a kid,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
and doing this stuff for real.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
And you know, along the way in this journey

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
of discovery,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
I learned a lot.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
I learned a lot about science. But I also learned a lot

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
about leadership.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Now you think director has got to be a leader,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
leader of, captain of the ship, and all that sort of thing.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
I didn't really learn about leadership

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
until I did these expeditions.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Because I had to, at a certain point, say,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
"What am I doing out here?

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Why am I doing this? What do I get out of it?"

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
We don't make money at these damn shows.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
We barely break even. There is no fame in it.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
People sort of think I went away

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
between "Titanic" and "Avatar" and was buffing my nails

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
someplace, sitting at the beach.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Made all these films, made all these documentary films

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
for a very limited audience.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
No fame, no glory, no money. What are you doing?

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
You're doing it for the task itself,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
for the challenge --

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is --

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
for the thrill of discovery,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
and for that strange bond that happens

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
when a small group of people form a tightly knit team.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Because we would do these things with 10, 12 people,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
working for years at a time,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
sometimes at sea for two, three months at a time.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
And in that bond, you realize

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
that the most important thing

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
is the respect that you have for them

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
and that they have for you, that you've done a task

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
that you can't explain to someone else.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
When you come back to the shore and you say,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
"We had to do this, and the fiber optic, and the attentuation,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
and the this and the that,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
all the technology of it, and the difficulty,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
the human-performance aspects of working at sea,"

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
you can't explain it to people. It's that thing that

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
maybe cops have, or people in combat that have gone through something together

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
and they know they can never explain it.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Creates a bond, creates a bond of respect.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
So, when I came back to make my next movie,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
which was "Avatar,"

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
I tried to apply that same principle of leadership,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
which is that you respect your team,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
and you earn their respect in return.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
And it really changed the dynamic.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
So, here I was again with a small team,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
in uncharted territory,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
doing "Avatar," coming up with new technology

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
that didn't exist before.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Tremendously exciting.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Tremendously challenging.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
And we became a family, over a four-and-half year period.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
And it completely changed how I do movies.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
So, people have commented on how, "Well, you know,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
you brought back the ocean organisms

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
and put them on the planet of Pandora."

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
To me, it was more of a fundamental way of doing business,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
the process itself, that changed as a result of that.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
So, what can we synthesize out of all this?

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
You know, what are the lessons learned?

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Well, I think number one is

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
curiosity.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
It's the most powerful thing you own.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Imagination is a force

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000
that can actually manifest a reality.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:43.000
And the respect of your team

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
is more important than all the

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
laurels in the world.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
I have young filmmakers

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
come up to me and say, "Give me some advice for doing this."

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
And I say, "Don't put limitations on yourself.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Other people will do that for you -- don't do it to yourself,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
don't bet against yourself,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
and take risks."

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
NASA has this phrase that they like:

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
"Failure is not an option."

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
But failure has to be an option

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
in art and in exploration, because it's a leap of faith.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
And no important endeavor

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
that required innovation

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
was done without risk.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
You have to be willing to take those risks.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
So, that's the thought I would leave you with,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
is that in whatever you're doing,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
failure is an option,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
but fear is not. Thank you.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:46.000
(Applause)
