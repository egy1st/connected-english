00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
(Music)

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
(Applause)

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I'm Jon M. Chu. And I'm not a dancer,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I'm not a choreographer -- I'm actually a filmmaker, a storyteller.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I directed a movie two years ago

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
called "Step Up 2: The Streets."

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Anybody? Anybody? Yeah!

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
During that movie I got to meet a ton of hip-hop dancers --

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
amazing, the best in the world --

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and they brought me into a society, the sort of underground

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
street culture that blew my mind.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I mean, this is literally human beings

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
with super-human strength and abilities.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
They could fly in the air. They could bend their elbow all the way back.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
They could spin on their heads for 80 times in a row.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I'd never seen anything like that.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
When I was growing up, my heroes were people like

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Michael Jackson.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I grew up in a musical family.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000
(Laughter)

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And those guys, those were like, ultimate heroes.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Being a shy, little, skinny Asian kid growing up in the Silicon Valley

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
with low self-esteem, those guys made me believe in something bigger.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Those guys made me want to, like, "I'm going to do that

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
moonwalk at that bar mitzvah tonight for that girl."

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
(Applause)

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And it seems like those dance heroes have disappeared,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
sort of relegated to the background of pop stars and music videos.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
But after seeing what I've seen,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
the truth is, they have not disappeared at all.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
They're here, getting better and better every day.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And dance has progressed.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
It is insane what dance is right now.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Dance has never had a better friend than technology.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Online videos and social networking ...

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
dancers have created a whole global laboratory online

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
for dance, where kids in Japan are taking moves

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
from a YouTube video created in Detroit,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
building on it within days and releasing a new video,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
while teenagers in California are taking the Japanese video and remixing it

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
with a Philly flair to create a whole new dance style in itself.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
And this is happening every day.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
And from these bedrooms and living rooms and garages,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
with cheap webcams,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
lies the world's great dancers of tomorrow.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Our Fred Astaires, our Gene Kellys

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
our Michael Jacksons are right at our fingertips,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
and may not have that opportunity, except for us.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
So, we created the LXD,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
sort of a -- the Legion of Extraordinary Dancers,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
a justice league of dancers that believe

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
that dance can have a transformative effect on the world.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
A living, breathing comic book series,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
but unlike Spiderman and Iron Man,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
these guys can actually do it.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
And we're going to show you some today. So, let me introduce to you,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
some of our heroes right now.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
We got Madd Chadd,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Lil' C, Kid David and J Smooth.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Please be excited, have fun, yell, scream.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Ladies and gentlemen: The LXD.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000
(Applause)

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
(Video): Madd Chadd: When people first see me,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
I get a lot of different reactions actually.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Sometimes you would think that maybe kids would enjoy it,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
but sometimes they get a little freaked out.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
And, I don't know, I kind of get a kick out of that a little bit.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
(Music)

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
(Applause)

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
J Smooth: When I'm in the zone -- I'm dancing and free styling it --

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
I actually visually kind of picture

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
lines, and moving them.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
I think of like, Transformers,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
like how panels open and then they fold,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
they fold in, and then you close that panel.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
And then another thing opens,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
you close that.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
(Music)

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.000
(Applause)

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Kid David: It's kind of like, honestly a lot of times

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
I don't really know what's going on

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
when I'm dancing.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Because at that point it's just really like, it's my body and the music.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
It's not really a conscious decision,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
"I'm going to do this next, I'm going to do this."

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
It's kind of like this other level

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
where you can't make choices anymore,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
and it's just your body reacting to certain sounds in the music.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
I got my name just because I was so young.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
I was young when I started. I was younger than a lot of the people I was dancing with.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000
So, it was always like, they called me Kid David, because I was the kid.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
(Music)

00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:01.000
(Applause)

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
L'il C: I tell them to create a ball,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
and then you just use that ball of energy.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And instead of throwing it out, people would think

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
that's a krump move, that's a krump move.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
That's not a krump move. You're going to throw it out,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
you throw it out, and you hold it.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
And you let it go, and then right when you see the tail,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
you grab it by the tail, then you bring it back in.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
And you just got this piece of energy

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
and you just, you're manipulating it.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
You know, you create power, then you tame it.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
(Music)

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:48.000
(Applause)

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
(Music)

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000
(Applause)
