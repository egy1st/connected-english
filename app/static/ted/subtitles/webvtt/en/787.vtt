00:00:01.182 --> 00:00:04.617
I have a vision for each one of you,

00:00:04.641 --> 00:00:06.445
and the vision I have for you

00:00:06.469 --> 00:00:08.851
is that when you wake up in the morning,

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:12.379
your blood is singing at the thought
of being who you are

00:00:12.403 --> 00:00:14.324
and doing what you do;

00:00:14.348 --> 00:00:15.880
that as you go through the day,

00:00:15.904 --> 00:00:19.387
you can literally sink
to your knees in gratitude

00:00:19.411 --> 00:00:23.542
at the tremendous good fortune
that's been bestowed on you;

00:00:23.566 --> 00:00:25.107
that as you go through the day,

00:00:25.131 --> 00:00:29.734
you become radiantly alive several times.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.401
And if your life isn't like that,

00:00:35.417 --> 00:00:38.176
I'd like to humbly suggest
that you're wasting your life.

00:00:38.968 --> 00:00:40.684
A life is too short to be wasted.

00:00:41.938 --> 00:00:45.074
So what I propose to do
in the next 17 minutes --

00:00:45.098 --> 00:00:47.089
I've used up one minute already --

00:00:47.113 --> 00:00:50.573
is to give you a set of powerful tools

00:00:50.597 --> 00:00:54.501
which can get you started on being there.

00:00:54.525 --> 00:00:55.819
Is that of interest to you?

00:00:55.843 --> 00:00:56.994
Audience: Yes.

00:00:57.018 --> 00:00:58.173
Srikumar Rao: OK.

00:00:58.197 --> 00:01:00.092
This is a conference on happiness,

00:01:00.116 --> 00:01:02.651
but even if it wasn't
a conference on happiness,

00:01:02.675 --> 00:01:07.776
would it be right if I said
that in some way, shape, fashion or form,

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.005
you're devoting your entire life

00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:11.205
to being happy?

00:01:11.586 --> 00:01:16.390
Everything you do -- your job, family,
children, relationships, whatever --

00:01:16.414 --> 00:01:18.576
is a quest for happiness.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.931
Correct?

00:01:19.955 --> 00:01:22.109
I'd like you to think about the following:

00:01:23.331 --> 00:01:26.909
What do you have to get

00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:29.434
in order to be happy?

00:01:29.458 --> 00:01:31.553
We're just going to spend
a minute on this.

00:01:31.577 --> 00:01:34.482
What do you have to get
in order to be happy?

00:01:36.411 --> 00:01:37.561
Anybody, quick?

00:01:38.394 --> 00:01:41.409
When I conduct this experiment,
a bunch of stuff comes up:

00:01:41.433 --> 00:01:48.427
vast wealth, trophy spouse, good health,
lots of travel, time, etc, etc, etc.

00:01:48.921 --> 00:01:50.917
Right now, if you were to think about it,

00:01:50.941 --> 00:01:53.584
you probably have a list
of, "Here's what I need to get

00:01:53.608 --> 00:01:55.035
in order to be happy."

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.403
I would like you to consider this:

00:01:58.427 --> 00:02:00.370
anything that you can get --

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.157
let me repeat that -- anything
you can get, you can un-get.

00:02:04.181 --> 00:02:05.331
Is that correct?

00:02:05.712 --> 00:02:09.840
So, vast wealth can make you happy.
Vast wealth can disappear tomorrow.

00:02:09.864 --> 00:02:13.700
A number of people in the financial sector
have discovered this already.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.090
So whatever you get
that can make you happy

00:02:18.114 --> 00:02:19.265
can go away.

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:20.550
Where does that leave you?

00:02:21.605 --> 00:02:23.145
Not a very nice place, right?

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:26.386
I have a different proposition
to suggest to you.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.933
What I have to suggest to you

00:02:27.957 --> 00:02:32.432
is that there is nothing
that you have to get, do or be

00:02:32.456 --> 00:02:33.759
in order to be happy.

00:02:34.274 --> 00:02:35.425
Let me repeat that:

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:39.558
there is nothing that you have to get,
do or be in order to be happy.

00:02:39.582 --> 00:02:42.680
In fact, happiness is your innate nature.

00:02:42.704 --> 00:02:46.425
It is hardwired into you.
It is part of your DNA.

00:02:47.554 --> 00:02:49.234
You cannot not be happy.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.682
Now, all of you are very polite,

00:02:51.706 --> 00:02:56.165
and in some of the other forums
I speak in, such as top business schools,

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:57.651
they're not so polite.

00:02:57.675 --> 00:03:01.594
And invariably, somebody articulates
what many of you are thinking,

00:03:01.618 --> 00:03:05.201
which is: "If happiness
is my innate nature,

00:03:05.225 --> 00:03:07.519
how come I am not experiencing it?

00:03:07.543 --> 00:03:10.766
How come I am experiencing my life sucks?"

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.832
(Laughter)

00:03:12.856 --> 00:03:15.887
And the answer to that
is actually very simple.

00:03:16.602 --> 00:03:20.603
You have spent your entire life

00:03:20.627 --> 00:03:23.224
learning to be unhappy.

00:03:24.748 --> 00:03:30.228
Let me repeat that: you have spent
your entire life learning to be unhappy.

00:03:30.252 --> 00:03:33.254
And the way we learn to be unhappy

00:03:33.278 --> 00:03:36.346
is by buying into
a particular mental model.

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.797
A mental model is a notion we have
that this is the way the world works.

00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:42.865
All of us have mental models,
we've got dozens of mental models.

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.282
We've got mental models
on how to find a job,

00:03:45.306 --> 00:03:48.207
how to get ahead at work,
how to pick a restaurant to eat at,

00:03:48.231 --> 00:03:51.295
how to have a movie
to go to ... dozens of them.

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.469
The problem isn't
that we have mental models.

00:03:53.493 --> 00:03:56.655
The problem is that we don't know
that we have mental models.

00:03:56.679 --> 00:03:58.885
We think this is the way the world works.

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:00.869
And the more we invest in a mental model,

00:04:00.893 --> 00:04:04.658
the more it appears that this, in fact,
is the way the world works.

00:04:04.682 --> 00:04:06.905
But it isn't: it's just a mental model,

00:04:06.929 --> 00:04:10.568
and the mental model we have
that we buy into so strongly

00:04:10.592 --> 00:04:14.469
is that we have to get something
so we can do something

00:04:14.493 --> 00:04:16.021
so we can be something.

00:04:16.045 --> 00:04:19.903
Like, we have to get a great deal of money
so we can travel to exotic places

00:04:19.927 --> 00:04:21.187
so we can be happy.

00:04:22.363 --> 00:04:25.418
We have to be in a relationship
so we can have great sex

00:04:25.442 --> 00:04:26.702
so we can be happy.

00:04:27.337 --> 00:04:32.295
All of this is a variation
of the if-then model.

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:34.329
And the if-then model is:

00:04:34.353 --> 00:04:35.938
if this happens,

00:04:36.708 --> 00:04:38.454
then we will be happy.

00:04:40.197 --> 00:04:43.380
If I were to get a better job,
if I were to get more money,

00:04:43.404 --> 00:04:45.588
if my boss would have a heart attack,

00:04:45.612 --> 00:04:51.264
if only I was married,
if only my wife would leave me --

00:04:51.288 --> 00:04:52.465
(Laughter)

00:04:52.489 --> 00:04:53.998
if only I had children,

00:04:54.022 --> 00:04:56.836
if my children would grow up
and go to college ...

00:04:57.696 --> 00:04:59.392
It doesn't matter what it is.

00:04:59.416 --> 00:05:02.210
The whole notion is if this happens,

00:05:02.606 --> 00:05:04.606
then I will be happy.

00:05:05.697 --> 00:05:08.174
And right now, the only thing
that's different

00:05:08.198 --> 00:05:11.118
between the persons in this audience

00:05:11.142 --> 00:05:14.695
is what is the particular "if"
that you are focusing on?

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:16.442
And the only thing that's different

00:05:16.466 --> 00:05:19.042
between you now
and where you were 10 years ago

00:05:19.066 --> 00:05:22.066
is what is the particular "if"
that you were focusing on?

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:25.101
Think about your life 10 years ago.

00:05:25.757 --> 00:05:27.115
Spend a minute doing that.

00:05:28.004 --> 00:05:30.132
Ten years ago, if you remember clearly,

00:05:30.156 --> 00:05:31.934
there were certain things you wanted.

00:05:31.958 --> 00:05:33.108
Is that correct?

00:05:33.534 --> 00:05:35.164
Odds are pretty good

00:05:35.188 --> 00:05:38.291
that many of those things you wanted
10 years ago you now have.

00:05:38.315 --> 00:05:39.465
Is that correct?

00:05:40.666 --> 00:05:42.175
Where has that left you?

00:05:44.704 --> 00:05:47.117
In exactly the same place, right?

00:05:47.141 --> 00:05:51.884
What we don't realize
is the model itself is flawed.

00:05:51.908 --> 00:05:54.902
The if-then model --
"If this happens I will be happy" --

00:05:54.926 --> 00:05:56.970
the model itself is flawed.

00:05:57.462 --> 00:06:01.530
But instead of recognizing
that it is the model itself that's flawed,

00:06:01.554 --> 00:06:05.066
what we do is spend
enormous amounts of time

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.834
changing the "if."

00:06:07.596 --> 00:06:10.929
"Oh, well, I thought if I became
CEO it would help,

00:06:10.953 --> 00:06:13.596
but now I realize it's not
that I want to become a CEO.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.039
I want to become the billionaire CEO,

00:06:16.063 --> 00:06:17.652
and then I will be happy."

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.477
You've got your own variation on that.

00:06:20.501 --> 00:06:25.158
But it's the model itself that's flawed,
not what you put on the "if" side

00:06:25.182 --> 00:06:26.349
of the equation.

00:06:26.943 --> 00:06:28.918
I can demonstrate that to you.

00:06:28.942 --> 00:06:30.483
Can any of you recall a time

00:06:30.507 --> 00:06:35.043
when you were confronted with a scene
of such spectacular beauty

00:06:35.067 --> 00:06:39.682
that it took you outside of yourself
into a place of great serenity?

00:06:40.266 --> 00:06:42.890
Maybe a rainbow, a mountain range,

00:06:42.914 --> 00:06:44.612
a valley, the sea.

00:06:44.636 --> 00:06:47.460
And if you remember that --
raise your hands if you could.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.603
Virtually all of you could, right?

00:06:49.627 --> 00:06:52.075
Have you ever wondered why that happened?

00:06:52.935 --> 00:06:55.707
The reason that happened is that somehow,

00:06:56.469 --> 00:06:57.890
for some reason,

00:06:58.627 --> 00:07:00.025
at that instant,

00:07:01.157 --> 00:07:05.657
you accepted the universe
exactly as it was.

00:07:06.585 --> 00:07:07.839
You didn't say,

00:07:07.863 --> 00:07:10.799
"That's a beautiful rainbow,
but it's kind of off to the left,

00:07:10.823 --> 00:07:13.216
and if I could move it
200 yards to the right,

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.391
it would be ever so much more beautiful."

00:07:15.415 --> 00:07:17.142
(Laughter)

00:07:17.166 --> 00:07:19.637
You didn't say,
"That's a beautiful valley,

00:07:19.661 --> 00:07:22.653
but the tree in the foreground
has too many crooked branches.

00:07:22.677 --> 00:07:24.948
So if you gave me
a chainsaw and 20 minutes,

00:07:24.972 --> 00:07:26.615
I'd make it ever so much better."

00:07:27.009 --> 00:07:28.632
Oh no, the rainbow off-center

00:07:28.656 --> 00:07:29.814
was just fine.

00:07:29.838 --> 00:07:31.480
The tree with its crooked branches

00:07:31.504 --> 00:07:32.788
was just fine.

00:07:32.812 --> 00:07:36.485
And the moment you accepted
the universe just as it was,

00:07:37.485 --> 00:07:41.024
your habitual-wanting self dropped away,

00:07:41.048 --> 00:07:44.303
and the happiness which is
your innate nature surfaced,

00:07:44.327 --> 00:07:45.485
and you felt it.

00:07:45.989 --> 00:07:48.149
And I know you felt it because now,

00:07:48.173 --> 00:07:50.518
even now after all those years,

00:07:50.542 --> 00:07:52.604
you can still remember it.

00:07:54.119 --> 00:07:57.087
The problem is that your life right now,

00:07:57.111 --> 00:07:59.675
with all of the problems that you have --

00:07:59.699 --> 00:08:04.215
more precisely, all of the problems
that you think you have --

00:08:04.239 --> 00:08:06.073
is equally perfect.

00:08:07.827 --> 00:08:09.447
But you do not accept it.

00:08:09.471 --> 00:08:12.370
In fact, you're spending all your time

00:08:12.394 --> 00:08:16.582
striving with might and main
to make it different.

00:08:16.606 --> 00:08:18.541
You are not accepting it.

00:08:19.678 --> 00:08:21.346
And when you're not accepting it,

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:23.401
you're buying into the if-then model:

00:08:23.425 --> 00:08:26.491
if this happens, then I will be happy.

00:08:26.515 --> 00:08:29.533
And it's the model itself that is flawed.

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.470
So let me show you how
you can get out of that,

00:08:33.494 --> 00:08:36.966
or at least you can begin the steps
towards getting out of that.

00:08:38.054 --> 00:08:40.283
I'd like to share with you that action.

00:08:40.776 --> 00:08:44.022
We all live our lives because we want
to achieve something, correct?

00:08:44.046 --> 00:08:46.614
You know, we are here
and we want to have something.

00:08:46.977 --> 00:08:49.511
Alex wants to have
a successful conference.

00:08:49.535 --> 00:08:53.240
You know, many of you want to have
great programs for your companies

00:08:53.264 --> 00:08:54.754
that are very successful.

00:08:54.778 --> 00:08:57.969
You want to progress, have more money,
all of that, is that correct?

00:09:01.296 --> 00:09:05.027
Each of those is an outcome;
you would like something to happen.

00:09:05.916 --> 00:09:08.133
Now, I'd like you to think
about the following:

00:09:08.157 --> 00:09:10.030
actions are within your control,

00:09:10.054 --> 00:09:11.942
not entirely, but to a large extent.

00:09:12.443 --> 00:09:15.029
The outcome is completely
out of your control.

00:09:15.613 --> 00:09:16.764
OK?

00:09:16.788 --> 00:09:18.480
Actions are within your control.

00:09:18.504 --> 00:09:20.737
The outcome is completely
outside your control.

00:09:20.761 --> 00:09:23.222
Have any of you recognized
that when you have a goal

00:09:23.246 --> 00:09:25.260
and you start to work towards it,

00:09:25.284 --> 00:09:27.582
some of the time
you don't achieve your goal,

00:09:27.606 --> 00:09:29.329
and some of the time what you get

00:09:29.353 --> 00:09:31.704
is the exact opposite of what you wanted?

00:09:31.728 --> 00:09:33.521
Has that happened to any of you?

00:09:34.174 --> 00:09:37.665
Like there was a friend of mine
who said, "Gee, you know,

00:09:37.689 --> 00:09:41.315
I have not been paying
a lot of attention to my wife,

00:09:41.339 --> 00:09:42.523
and this has to change."

00:09:42.547 --> 00:09:44.618
So the next time
we went on a business trip,

00:09:44.642 --> 00:09:47.163
he bought a very expensive dress for her.

00:09:47.758 --> 00:09:50.724
And this was his way of showing,
you know, I care for you,

00:09:50.748 --> 00:09:52.685
and nice things would happen.

00:09:52.709 --> 00:09:56.732
And when he presented the gift
to his wife, her immediate reaction was,

00:09:57.613 --> 00:10:00.942
"After 20 years of marriage,
you don't know my size?"

00:10:00.966 --> 00:10:02.227
(Laughter)

00:10:02.251 --> 00:10:06.966
"And furthermore, don't you know
I never wear this kind of thing?"

00:10:07.451 --> 00:10:11.096
And the next thing you know,
he had a full-blown marital spat.

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.760
Has that happened to any of you?

00:10:12.784 --> 00:10:15.577
You've taken action
for a particular outcome

00:10:15.601 --> 00:10:17.777
and the outcome you got
was the exact opposite

00:10:17.801 --> 00:10:19.285
of what you wanted?

00:10:19.309 --> 00:10:20.693
Happens all the time.

00:10:21.185 --> 00:10:25.615
Well, we live in a world
where what we think of,

00:10:25.639 --> 00:10:27.061
what we invest in,

00:10:27.085 --> 00:10:28.513
is the outcome.

00:10:28.939 --> 00:10:30.884
We define our life in the following way:

00:10:30.908 --> 00:10:32.952
here I am, here is where I want to go,

00:10:32.976 --> 00:10:36.095
these are the steps I have to take
in order to get from where I am

00:10:36.119 --> 00:10:37.301
to where I want to go,

00:10:37.325 --> 00:10:39.850
and if I succeed, life is wonderful.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:44.667
And if I don't, then I have failed,

00:10:44.691 --> 00:10:47.172
life is no good, life sucks.

00:10:48.305 --> 00:10:49.569
True? False?

00:10:50.148 --> 00:10:51.696
That is how we live.

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:53.891
We invest in the outcome,

00:10:53.915 --> 00:10:55.815
and as I've just pointed out,

00:10:55.839 --> 00:10:59.165
the outcome is frequently different
from what we would like,

00:10:59.189 --> 00:11:02.544
and sometimes the diametric opposite
of what we would like.

00:11:02.568 --> 00:11:06.723
You invest in the outcome
and you are guaranteed to have

00:11:06.747 --> 00:11:08.877
more than your share of frustration, angst

00:11:08.901 --> 00:11:11.521
and all the rest of the stuff
that makes life suck.

00:11:12.298 --> 00:11:13.552
There is an alternative.

00:11:14.067 --> 00:11:17.904
And the alternative is that you do not
invest in the outcome,

00:11:17.928 --> 00:11:20.608
you invest in the process.

00:11:21.326 --> 00:11:25.717
And the best way to describe that
is a quote by John Wooden.

00:11:25.741 --> 00:11:28.565
I don't know how many of you
are familiar with John Wooden.

00:11:28.589 --> 00:11:30.617
He's very well-known in the United States

00:11:30.641 --> 00:11:32.679
and certainly among basketball fans.

00:11:33.148 --> 00:11:37.002
He's the only person ever to make
the basketball Hall of Fame

00:11:37.026 --> 00:11:39.162
both as a player and as a coach.

00:11:39.804 --> 00:11:41.774
And what he told his entering team --

00:11:41.798 --> 00:11:47.872
he led UCLA to an unprecedented number
of victories and finals in the NCAA --

00:11:47.896 --> 00:11:53.329
and what he used to tell any new team
is he never spoke about winning.

00:11:54.011 --> 00:11:58.298
He always said, "When it's over
and you look in the mirror,

00:11:58.322 --> 00:12:01.027
did you do the best
that you were capable of?

00:12:01.791 --> 00:12:04.583
And if you did the best
that you were capable of,

00:12:04.607 --> 00:12:06.105
the score doesn't matter.

00:12:06.729 --> 00:12:10.401
But I would suspect that if you did
the best that you were capable of,

00:12:10.425 --> 00:12:12.597
you will find the score to your liking."

00:12:14.058 --> 00:12:16.955
That is investing in a process.

00:12:17.474 --> 00:12:19.734
What we do is the exact opposite.

00:12:19.758 --> 00:12:21.519
We invest in the outcome.

00:12:21.543 --> 00:12:24.291
This is what I want -- oh,
I want it so desperately,

00:12:24.315 --> 00:12:26.717
because if I get it I will be happy.

00:12:26.741 --> 00:12:30.078
And you try with might and main,
to do whatever you can,

00:12:30.102 --> 00:12:34.118
but you are always focusing
on, "This is the outcome."

00:12:34.683 --> 00:12:36.770
Now, focusing on the outcome is fine.

00:12:36.794 --> 00:12:38.056
It gives you direction.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.152
Investing in the outcome means

00:12:40.176 --> 00:12:45.121
that you make the achievement
of a particular outcome

00:12:45.145 --> 00:12:47.915
dependent for your well-being.

00:12:47.939 --> 00:12:50.598
And that is a surefire recipe for failure.

00:12:51.319 --> 00:12:53.413
What you can do is something else.

00:12:53.437 --> 00:12:56.484
You can invest in the process.

00:12:57.809 --> 00:13:00.674
That is, once you have determined,
here is where I am,

00:13:00.698 --> 00:13:02.998
here is where I want to be,
and that's fine,

00:13:03.022 --> 00:13:07.006
you focus on the outcome only
to the extent that it gives you direction,

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:10.346
and then you invest yourself
completely in the process.

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:12.497
You say, here are the steps
you want to take,

00:13:12.521 --> 00:13:14.480
and you put everything into it.

00:13:14.976 --> 00:13:17.671
And if you succeed, wonderful.

00:13:18.671 --> 00:13:20.839
And if you don't succeed,

00:13:20.863 --> 00:13:22.807
still wonderful,

00:13:24.275 --> 00:13:27.937
because now you have a new starting point,
and from that new starting point,

00:13:27.961 --> 00:13:30.222
you select another outcome and keep going.

00:13:30.828 --> 00:13:34.264
And when you do that, you will find
that every day is a blast.

00:13:34.817 --> 00:13:36.138
Let me give you an example.

00:13:36.162 --> 00:13:39.297
And if you have children -- raise
your hands if you have children.

00:13:39.321 --> 00:13:41.788
Have you ever seen
a small child learn to walk?

00:13:42.708 --> 00:13:45.921
What happens, and this happens
typically between 11 and 13 months,

00:13:45.945 --> 00:13:49.641
is the child gets up
and she sees everybody walking,

00:13:49.665 --> 00:13:53.281
she wants to walk, she gets up,
she falls down, she starts crying

00:13:53.305 --> 00:13:57.261
and momma runs up and comforts her,
kisses the place, makes it well.

00:13:57.285 --> 00:14:00.224
She tries again, falls down,
mommy runs up again.

00:14:00.248 --> 00:14:03.935
After some time, mommy feels tired
and no longer runs up

00:14:03.959 --> 00:14:05.890
and the child stops crying,

00:14:05.914 --> 00:14:07.960
and then she gets up, takes a step

00:14:07.984 --> 00:14:10.554
and doesn't fall down,
and then she takes another,

00:14:10.578 --> 00:14:12.812
and a beautiful smile comes on her face.

00:14:12.836 --> 00:14:16.552
And very soon, generally within 24 hours,
she's walking all over the place,

00:14:16.576 --> 00:14:18.883
upsetting your living room arrangements.

00:14:18.907 --> 00:14:21.391
And you know you've gone
to a new stage of parenting.

00:14:21.415 --> 00:14:22.566
Right?

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:25.015
Now, imagine what would happen

00:14:25.039 --> 00:14:28.132
if each time the child fell,

00:14:28.156 --> 00:14:31.726
she would say, "Oh my God, I failed again.

00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:34.115
I'm never going to learn to walk."

00:14:34.139 --> 00:14:36.268
And you have to get counseling for her

00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:39.395
to help her deal with
feelings of inadequacy

00:14:39.419 --> 00:14:43.831
and not being able to achieve
and fail yet again.

00:14:43.855 --> 00:14:47.594
How long do you think it would take her
to learn to walk if you had to do that,

00:14:47.618 --> 00:14:50.578
if every three times she fell down,
you had to get a counselor

00:14:50.602 --> 00:14:52.423
to counsel her and so on?

00:14:52.781 --> 00:14:54.185
Sounds funny, doesn't it?

00:14:54.629 --> 00:14:56.733
But that is exactly what we're doing.

00:14:56.757 --> 00:15:01.015
What the child is doing
is focusing on the process.

00:15:01.039 --> 00:15:03.895
She's investing in the process,

00:15:03.919 --> 00:15:05.709
not in the outcome.

00:15:06.812 --> 00:15:09.409
What we do is the exact opposite.

00:15:09.433 --> 00:15:13.278
As we grow up, we lose the ability
to invest in the process,

00:15:13.302 --> 00:15:15.475
we start investing in the outcome.

00:15:15.499 --> 00:15:19.111
By definition the outcome
is outside of our control,

00:15:19.135 --> 00:15:21.912
and if that's where we spend
all of our emotional energy,

00:15:21.936 --> 00:15:24.191
we are going to get drained as we do.

00:15:24.801 --> 00:15:26.500
But if, on the other hand, we said,

00:15:26.524 --> 00:15:29.215
"Here is the outcome,
I am going to invest in the process

00:15:29.239 --> 00:15:31.572
and give it every single bit I could,"

00:15:32.794 --> 00:15:34.677
every day is a blast,

00:15:34.701 --> 00:15:38.914
and you're well on your way to achieving
the vision that I outlined to you.

00:15:39.527 --> 00:15:42.913
The question that I get all the time,
is people say, "Professor Rao,

00:15:42.937 --> 00:15:45.372
but nothing makes me passionate."

00:15:45.396 --> 00:15:46.972
So I say, "OK, what would?"

00:15:46.996 --> 00:15:50.547
And they invariably come up with,
you know, here is a list of things.

00:15:50.571 --> 00:15:52.691
Here's my job and here's how much it pays,

00:15:52.715 --> 00:15:54.531
this is the kind of person my boss is,

00:15:54.555 --> 00:15:56.330
the kind of people my colleagues are,

00:15:56.354 --> 00:15:59.107
and here's how my customers are,
here's how much I travel,

00:15:59.131 --> 00:16:01.749
here's how big my office is,
how deep the carpeting is,

00:16:01.773 --> 00:16:03.320
how many windows I have --

00:16:03.344 --> 00:16:04.812
a bunch of parameters.

00:16:05.835 --> 00:16:08.534
And what I tell them is what
I want to share with you,

00:16:08.558 --> 00:16:11.820
because all of that stuff --
first of all, it doesn't exist.

00:16:11.844 --> 00:16:14.487
But second, even if it did
and you were plugged into it,

00:16:14.511 --> 00:16:16.352
it would not take more than six months

00:16:16.376 --> 00:16:19.811
for you to be the same sorry,
miserable self there as you are now,

00:16:20.795 --> 00:16:24.233
because passion exists inside you.

00:16:24.257 --> 00:16:26.787
It does not exist in the job.

00:16:27.436 --> 00:16:30.989
And if you don't find a way
to ignite it within you

00:16:31.013 --> 00:16:32.849
right where you are,

00:16:32.873 --> 00:16:35.644
you are not going to find it outside.

00:16:36.305 --> 00:16:40.999
But if you do find a way
to ignite it where you are,

00:16:41.023 --> 00:16:43.620
then you will find that the external world

00:16:43.644 --> 00:16:45.333
rearranges itself

00:16:47.741 --> 00:16:50.622
to accommodate the new person
that you are becoming.

00:16:51.137 --> 00:16:56.057
And as you do that, you will find
that miracles happen on a regular basis.

00:16:56.081 --> 00:16:58.303
Persons come up
whom you're delighted to meet.

00:16:58.327 --> 00:16:59.835
New people enter your life.

00:16:59.859 --> 00:17:01.314
It's just a breeze,

00:17:02.152 --> 00:17:05.258
because all you do in your life
is you take journeys.

00:17:05.818 --> 00:17:08.660
You came here to this conference;
you went on a journey.

00:17:09.154 --> 00:17:10.754
You hang around the water cooler,

00:17:10.778 --> 00:17:13.248
talking about how terrible
your place of work is;

00:17:13.272 --> 00:17:14.532
you went on a journey.

00:17:15.025 --> 00:17:17.754
You watch "Desperate Housewives,"
you go on a journey.

00:17:17.778 --> 00:17:19.457
You go on a journey

00:17:19.481 --> 00:17:22.832
where 40-something women are having
affairs with 19-something gardeners

00:17:22.856 --> 00:17:25.223
while the husbands
are playing around with models.

00:17:25.247 --> 00:17:26.761
All you do is go on journeys.

00:17:27.175 --> 00:17:29.774
There's nothing wrong with that,
but just ask yourself,

00:17:29.798 --> 00:17:32.893
"Is this a journey I want to take?

00:17:32.917 --> 00:17:35.956
Does this take me to a place
I want to spend time?"

00:17:36.932 --> 00:17:38.730
And if you start doing that,

00:17:38.754 --> 00:17:41.008
you will find that your life changes.

00:17:41.032 --> 00:17:43.611
The kind of people you meet,
the things you talk about,

00:17:43.635 --> 00:17:45.668
the movies you go to,
the books you read --

00:17:45.692 --> 00:17:47.147
everything changes.

00:17:48.957 --> 00:17:51.191
And you begin all of that

00:17:51.215 --> 00:17:53.366
by focusing on the process.

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:56.404
Invest in the process, not in the outcome.

00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:59.112
Thank you.
