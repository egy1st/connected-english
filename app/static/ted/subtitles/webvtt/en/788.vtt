WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Last year here at TED

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I asked you to give me your data,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
to put your data on the web, on the basis

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
that if people put data onto the web --

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
government data, scientific data, community data,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
whatever it is -- it will be used by other people

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
to do wonderful things, in ways

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
that they never could have imagined.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So, today I'm back just to show you a few things,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
to show you, in fact, there is

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
an open data movement afoot,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
now, around the world.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The cry of "Raw data now!"

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
which I made people make in the auditorium,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
was heard around the world.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So, let's roll the video.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
A classic story, the first one which lots of people picked up,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
was when in March -- on March 10th in fact, soon after TED --

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Paul Clarke, in the U.K. government,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
blogged, "Oh, I've just got some raw data. Here it is,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
it's about bicycle accidents."

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Two days it took the Times Online

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
to make a map, a mashable map --

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
we call these things mash-ups --

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
a mashed-up user interface that allows you to go in there

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and have a look and find out whether your bicycle

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
route to work was affected.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Here's more data, traffic survey data,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
again, put out by the U.K. government,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and because they put it up using the Linked Data standards,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
then a user could just make a map,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
just by clicking.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Does this data affect things? Well, let's get back to 2008.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Look at Zanesville, Ohio.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Here's a map a lawyer made. He put on it the water plant,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and which houses are there,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
which houses have been connected to the water.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And he got, from other data sources,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
information to show

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
which houses are occupied by white people.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Well, there was too much of a correlation, he felt,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
between which houses were occupied by white people

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and which houses had water, and the judge was not impressed either.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
The judge was not impressed to the tune of 10.9 million dollars.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
That's the power of taking one piece of data,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
another piece of data, putting it together,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and showing the result.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Let's look at some data from the U.K. now.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
This is U.K. government data, a completely independent site,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Where Does My Money Go.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
It allows anybody to go there and burrow down.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
You can burrow down by a particular type of spending,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
or you can go through all the different regions and compare them.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
So, that's happening in the U.K. with U.K. government data.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Yes, certainly you can do it over here.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Here's a site which allows you to look at recovery spending

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
in California.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Take an arbitrary example, Long Beach, California,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
you can go and have a look at what recovery money they've been spending

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
on different things such as energy.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
In fact, this is the graph of the number of data sets

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
in the repositories of data.gov,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
and data.gov.uk.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And I'm delighted to see a great competition

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
between the U.K. in blue, and the U.S. in red.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
How can you use this stuff?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Well, for example, if you have lots of data about places

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
you can take, from a postcode --

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
which is like a zip plus four --

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
for a specific group of houses, you can make paper,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
print off a paper which has got very, very

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
specific things about the bus stops,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
the things specifically near you.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
On a larger scale, this is a mash-up

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
of the data which was released about the Afghan elections.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
It allows you to set your own criteria

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
for what sort of things you want to look at.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
The red circles are polling stations,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
selected by your criteria.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
And then you can select also other things on the map

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
to see what other factors, like the threat level.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
So, that was government data.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
I also talked about community-generated data -- in fact I edited some.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
This is the wiki map, this is the Open Street Map.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
"Terrace Theater" I actually put

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
on the map because it wasn't on the map before TED last year.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I was not the only person editing the open street map.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Each flash on this visualization --

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
put together by ITO World --

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
shows an edit in 2009

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
made to the Open Street Map.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Let's now spin the world during the same year.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Every flash is an edit. Somebody somewhere

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
looking at the Open Street Map, and realizing it could be better.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
You can see Europe is ablaze with updates.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Some places, perhaps not as much as they should be.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Here focusing in on Haiti.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
The map of Port au-Prince at the end

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
of 2009 was not all it could be,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
not as good as the map of California.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Fortunately, just after the earthquake,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
GeoEye, a commercial company,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
released satellite imagery

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
with a license, which allowed

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
the open-source community to use it.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
This is January, in time lapse,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
of people editing ... that's the earthquake.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
After the earthquake, immediately,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
people all over the world, mappers

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
who wanted to help, and could,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
looked at that imagery, built the map, quickly building it up.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
We're focusing now on Port-au-Prince.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
The light blue is refugee camps these volunteers had spotted from the [satellite images].

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
So, now we have, immediately, a real-time map

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
showing where there are refugee camps --

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
rapidly became the best map

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
to use if you're doing relief work in Port-au-Prince.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Witness the fact that it's here on this Garmin device

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
being used by rescue team in Haiti.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
There's the map showing,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
on the left-hand side,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
that hospital -- actually that's a hospital ship.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
This is a real-time map that shows blocked roads,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
damaged buildings, refugee camps --

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
it shows things that are needed [for rescue and relief work].

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
So, if you've been involved in that at all,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
I just wanted to say: Whatever you've been doing,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
whether you've just been chanting, "Raw data now!"

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
or you've been putting government or scientific data online,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
I just wanted to take this opportunity to say: Thank you very much,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and we have only just started!

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
(Applause)
