00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I only have three minutes

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
so I'm going to have to talk fast, and it will

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
use up your spare mental cycles, so multitasking may be hard.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
So, 27 years ago I got a traffic ticket

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
that got me thinking.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I've had some time to think it over.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And energy efficiency is more than just

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
about the vehicle --

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
it's also about the road.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Road design makes a difference, particularly intersections,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
of which there are two types: signalized

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and unsignalized, which means stop signs.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Fifty percent of crashes happen at intersections.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Roundabouts are much better.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
A study of 24 intersections

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
has found crashes drop 40 percent

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
from when you convert a traffic light into a roundabout.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Injury crashes have dropped 76 percent,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
fatal crashes down 90 percent.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
But that's just safety.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
What about time and gas?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
So, traffic keeps flowing, so that means less braking,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
which means less accelerating, less gas and less pollution,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
less time wasted,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and that partly accounts for Europe's better efficiency

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
than we have in the United States.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So, unsignalized intersections,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
meaning stop signs, they save many lives,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
but there's an excessive proliferation of them.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Small roundabouts are starting to appear.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
This is one in my neighborhood. And they are

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
much better -- better than traffic lights, better than four-way stop signs.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
They're expensive to install,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
but they are more expensive not to. So, we should look at that.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
But they are not applicable in all situations.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So, take, for example, the three-way intersection.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So, it's logical that you'd have one there,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
on the minor road entering the major.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
But the other two are somewhat questionable.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So, here's one. There's another one which I studied.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Cars rarely appear on that third road.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And so, the question is, what does that cost us?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
That intersection I looked at had about 3,000

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
cars per day in each direction,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and so that's two ounces of gas to accelerate out of.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
That's five cents each, and times 3,000 cars per day,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
that's $51,000 per year.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
That's just the gasoline cost. There is also pollution,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
wear on the car, and time.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
What's that time worth?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Well, at 10 seconds per 3,000 cars,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
that's 8.3 hours per day. The average wage in the U.S.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
is $20 an hour. That is 60,000 per year.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Add that together with the gas, and it's $112,000 per year,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
just for that sign in each direction.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Discount that back to the present, at five percent:

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
over two million dollars

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
for a stop sign, in each direction.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Now, if you look at what that adjacent property is worth,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
you could actually buy the property,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
cut down the shrubbery to improve the sight line,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and then sell it off again.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And you'd still come out ahead.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
So, it makes one wonder, "Why is it there?"

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I mean, why is there that stop sign in each direction?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Because it is saving lives. So, is there a better way to accomplish that goal?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
The answer is to enable cars

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
to come in from that side road safely.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Because there are a lot of people who might live up there

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and if they're waiting forever a long queue could form

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
because the cars aren't slowing down on the main road.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Can that be accomplished with existing signs?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So, there is a long history of stop signs and yield signs.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Stop signs were invented in 1915,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
yield signs in 1950. But that's all we got.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
So, why not use a yield sign?

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Well the meaning of yield is: You must yield the right-of-way.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
That means that if there are five cars waiting, you have to wait

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
till they all go, then you go. It lacks the notion

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
of alternating, or taking turns,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and it's always on the minor road,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
allowing the major one to have primacy.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
So, it's hard to create a new meaning for the existing sign.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
You couldn't suddenly tell everyone, "OK, remember

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
what you used to do at yield signs? Now do something different."

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
That would not work.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
So, what the world needs now

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
is a new type of sign.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
(Applause)

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
So, you'd have a little instruction below it,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
you know, for those who didn't see the public service announcements.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And it merges the stop sign and yield signs.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
It's kind of shaped like a T, as in taking turns.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
And uncertainty results in caution.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
When people come to an unfamiliar situation they don't know how to deal with

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
they slow down.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
So, now that you are all "Road Scholars" ...

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000
(Laughter)

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
don't wait for that sign to be adopted, these things don't change quickly.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
But you all are members of communities,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
and you can exercise your community influence

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
to create more sensible traffic flows.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And you can have more impact on the environment

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
just getting your neighborhood to change these things

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
than by changing your vehicle. Thank you very much.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
(Applause)
