00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'll just take you to Bangladesh for a minute.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Before I tell that story, we should ask ourselves the question:

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Why does poverty exist?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I mean, there is plenty of knowledge and scientific breakthroughs.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
We all live in the same planet,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
but there's still a great deal of poverty in the world.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And I think -- so I want to throw a perspective that I have,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
so that we can assess this project, or any other project, for that matter,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
to see whether it's contributing or --

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
contributing to poverty or trying to alleviate it.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Rich countries have been sending aid to poor countries for the last 60 years.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And by and large, this has failed.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And you can see this book,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
written by someone who worked in the World Bank for 20 years,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and he finds economic growth in this country to be elusive.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
By and large, it did not work.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So the question is, why is that?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
In my mind, there is something to learn from the history of Europe.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I mean, even here, yesterday I was walking across the street,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and they showed three bishops were executed 500 years ago,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
right across the street from here.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
So my point is, there's a lot of struggle has gone in Europe,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
where citizens were empowered by technologies.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And they demanded authorities from --

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
to come down from their high horses.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And in the end, there's better bargaining

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
between the authorities and citizens,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and democracies, capitalism -- everything else flourished.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And so you can see, the real process of --

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
and this is backed up by this 500-page book --

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
that the authorities came down and citizens got up.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
But if you look, if you have that perspective,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
then you can see what happened in the last 60 years.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Aid actually did the opposite.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
It empowered authorities,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and, as a result, marginalized citizens.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
The authorities did not have the reason to make economic growth happen

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
so that they could tax people

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and make more money for to run their business.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Because they were getting it from abroad.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And in fact, if you see oil-rich countries,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
where citizens are not yet empowered, the same thing goes --

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, all sorts of countries.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Because the aid and oil or mineral money acts the same way.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
It empowers authorities, without activating the citizens --

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
their hands, legs, brains, what have you.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000
And if you agree with that, then I think the best way to improve these countries

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
is to recognize that economic development is of the people,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
by the people, for the people.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And that is the real network effect.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
If citizens can network and make themselves more organized and productive,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
so that their voices are heard,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
so then things would improve.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And to contrast that, you can see the most important institution in the world,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
the World Bank, is an organization of the government,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
by the government, for the governments.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Just see the contrast.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And that is the perspective I have, and then I can start my story.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Of course, how would you empower citizens?

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
There could be all sorts of technologies. And one is cell phones.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Recently "The Economist" recognized this,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
but I stumbled upon the idea 12 years ago,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
and that's what I've been working on.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
So 12 years ago, I was trying to be an investment banker in New York.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:27.000
We had -- quite a few our colleagues were connected by a computer network.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And we got more productive because we didn't have to exchange floppy disks;

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
we could update each other more often.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
But one time it broke down.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And it reminded me of a day in 1971.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
There was a war going on in my country.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
And my family moved out of an urban place, where we used to live,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
to a remote rural area where it was safer.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And one time my mother asked me to get some medicine for a younger sibling.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And I walked 10 miles or so, all morning, to get there, to the medicine man.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
And he wasn't there, so I walked all afternoon back.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
So I had another unproductive day.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
So while I was sitting in a tall building in New York,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
I put those two experiences together side by side,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
and basically concluded that connectivity is productivity --

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
whether it's in a modern office or an underdeveloped village.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
So naturally, I -- the implication of that is

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
that the telephone is a weapon against poverty.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And if that's the case, then the question is

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
how many telephones did we have at that time?

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
And it turns out, that there was one telephone in Bangladesh

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
for every 500 people.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
And all those phones were in the few urban places.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
The vast rural areas, where 100 million people lived,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
there were no telephones.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
So just imagine how many man-months or man-years are wasted,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
just like I wasted a day.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
If you just multiply by 100 million people, let's say losing one day a month,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
whatever, and you see a vast amount of resource wasted.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And after all, poor countries, like rich countries, one thing we've got equal,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
is their days are the same length: 24 hours.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
So if you lose that precious resource,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
where you are somewhat equal to the richer countries,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
that's a huge waste.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
So I started looking for any evidence that --

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
does connectivity really increase productivity?

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And I couldn't find much, really, but I found this graph produced by the ITU,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.000
which is the International Telecommunication Union, based in Geneva.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
They show an interesting thing.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
That you see, the horizontal axis is where you place your country.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
So the United States or the UK would be here, outside.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
And so the impact of one new telephone,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
which is on the vertical axis, is very little.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
But if you come back to a poorer country, where the GNP per capita is,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
let's say, 500 dollars, or 300 dollars,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:15.000
then the impact is huge: 6,000 dollars. Or 5,000 dollars.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000
The question was,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
how much did it cost to install a new telephone in Bangladesh?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
It turns out: 2,000 dollars.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
So if you spend 2,000 dollars, and let's say the telephone lasts 10 years,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
and if 5,000 dollars every year -- so that's 50,000 dollars.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
So obviously this was a gadget to have.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
And of course, if the cost of installing a telephone is going down,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
because there's a digital revolution going on,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
then it would be even more dramatic.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
And I knew a little economics by then --

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
it says Adam Smith taught us that specialization leads to productivity.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
But how would you specialize?

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Let's say I'm a fisherman and a farmer.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.000
And Chris is a fisherman farmer. Both are generalists.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
So the point is that we could only -- the only way we could depend on each other,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
is if we can connect with each other.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000
And if we are neighbors, I could just walk over to his house.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
But then we are limiting our economic sphere to something very small area.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
But in order to expand that, you need a river,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
or you need a highway, or you need telephone lines.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.000
But in any event, it's connectivity that leads to dependability.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
And that leads to specialization.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
That leads to productivity.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
So the question was, I started looking at this issue,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
and going back and forth between Bangladesh and New York.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
There were a lot of reasons people told me

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
why we don't have enough telephones.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
And one of them is the lacking buying power.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Poor people apparently don't have the power to buy.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
But the point is, if it's a production tool, why do we have to worry about that?

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
I mean, in America, people buy cars,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
and they put very little money down.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
They get a car, and they go to work.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
The work pays them a salary;

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
the salary allows them to pay for the car over time.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000
The car pays for itself.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
So if the telephone is a production tool,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
then we don't quite have to worry about the purchasing power.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
And of course, even if that's true, then what about initial buying power?

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
So then the question is, why can't we have some kind of shared access?

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
In the United States, we have -- everybody needs a banking service,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
but very few of us are trying to buy a bank.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
So it's -- a bank tends to serve a whole community.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
So we could do that for telephones.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000
And also people told me that we have a lot of important primary needs to meet:

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
food, clothing, shelter, whatever.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
But again, it's very paternalistic.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
You should be raising income

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
and let people decide what they want to do with their money.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
But the real problem is the lack of other infrastructures.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000
See, you need some kind of infrastructure to bring a new thing.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
For instance, the Internet was booming in the U.S.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
because there were -- there were people who had computers.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
They had modems.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
They had telephone lines, so it's very easy to bring in a new idea, like the Internet.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
But that's what's lacking in a poor country.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
So for example, we didn't have ways to have credit checks,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
few banks to collect bills, etc.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
But that's why I noticed Grameen Bank, which is a bank for poor people,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:39.000
and had 1,100 branches, 12,000 employees, 2.3 million borrowers.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
And they had these branches.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
I thought I could put cell towers and create a network.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
And anyway, to cut the time short -- so I started --

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
I first went to them and said,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
"You know, perhaps I could connect all your branches and make you more efficient."

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
But you know, they have, after all, evolved in a country without telephones,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
so they are decentralized. I mean, of course there might be other good reasons,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
but this was one of the reasons -- they had to be.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
And so they were not that interested to connect all their branches,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
and then to be -- and rock the boat.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
So I started focusing. What is it that they really do?

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
So what happens is that somebody borrows money from the bank.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
She typically buys a cow. The cow gives milk.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
And she sells the milk to the villagers, and pays off the loan.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000
And this is a business for her, but it's milk for everybody else.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
And suddenly I realized that a cell phone could be a cow.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Because some way she could borrow 200 dollars from the bank,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
get a phone and have the phone for everybody.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
And it's a business for her.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000
So I wrote to the bank, and they thought for a while, and they said,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
"It's a little crazy, but logical.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
If you think it can be done, come and make it happen."

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
So I quit my job; I went back to Bangladesh.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
I created a company in America called Gonofone,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
which in Bengali means "people's phone."

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
And angel investors in America put in money into that.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
I flew around the world.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
After about a million -- I mean, I got rejected from lots of places,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
because I was not only trying to go to a poor country,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
I was trying to go to the poor of the poor country.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
After about a million miles, and a meaningful --

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
a substantial loss of hair, I eventually put together a consortium, and --

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
which involved the Norwegian telephone company,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
which provided the know-how,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.000
and the Grameen Bank provided the infrastructure to spread the service.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
To make the story short, here is the coverage of the country.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
You can see it's pretty much covered.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Even in Bangladesh, there are some empty places.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
But we are also investing around another 300 million dollars this year

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
to extend that coverage.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Now, about that cow model I talked about.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:04.000
There are about 115,000 people who are retailing telephone services

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
in their neighborhoods.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:12.000
And it's serving 52,000 villages, which represent about 80 million people.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
And these phones are generating

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
about 100 million dollars for the company.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
And two dollars profit per entrepreneur per day, which is like 700 dollars per year.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
And of course, it's very beneficial in a lot of ways.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
It increases income, improves welfare, etc.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
And the result is, right now, this company is the largest telephone company,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
with 3.5 million subscribers,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
115,000 of these phones I talked about --

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000
that produces about a third of the traffic in the network.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
And 2004, the net profit, after taxes --

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
very serious taxes -- was 120 million dollars.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
And the company contributed about 190 million dollars to the government coffers.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
And again, here are some of the lessons.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
"The government needs to provide economically viable services."

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Actually, this is an instance where private companies can provide that.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
"Governments need to subsidize private companies."

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
This is what some people think.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
And actually, private companies help governments with taxes.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
"Poor people are recipients."

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Poor people are a resource.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
"Services cost too much for the poor."

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Their involvement reduces the cost.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
"The poor are uneducated and cannot do much."

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
They are very eager learners and very capable survivors.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
I've been very surprised.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Most of them learn how to operate a telephone within a day.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
"Poor countries need aid."

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Businesses -- this one company has raised the --

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000
if the ideal figures are even five percent true, this one company

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000
is raising the GNP of the country much more than the aid the country receives.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
And as I was trying to show you, as far as I'm concerned,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000
aid does damages because it removes the government from its citizens.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
And this is a new project I have with Dean Kamen, the famous inventor in America.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
He has produced some power generators,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
which we are now doing an experiment in Bangladesh,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
in two villages where cow manure is producing biogas,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
which is running these generators.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
And each of these generators is selling electricity to 20 houses each.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000
It's just an experiment.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000
We don't know how far it will go,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
but it's going on.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Thank you.
