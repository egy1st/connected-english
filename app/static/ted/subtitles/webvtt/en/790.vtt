00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So, I've known a lot of fish in my life.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I've loved only two.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
That first one,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
it was more like a passionate affair.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It was a beautiful fish:

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
flavorful, textured, meaty,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
a bestseller on the menu.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
What a fish.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
(Laughter)

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Even better,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
it was farm-raised to the supposed highest standards

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
of sustainability.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So you could feel good about selling it.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I was in a relationship with this beauty

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
for several months.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
One day, the head of the company called

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and asked if I'd speak at an event

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
about the farm's sustainability.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
"Absolutely," I said.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Here was a company trying to solve

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
what's become this unimaginable problem for us chefs:

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
How do we keep fish on our menus?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
For the past 50 years,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
we've been fishing the seas

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
like we clear-cut forests.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
It's hard to overstate the destruction.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Ninety percent of large fish, the ones we love --

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
the tunas, the halibuts, the salmons, swordfish --

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
they've collapsed.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
There's almost nothing left.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
So, for better or for worse,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
aquaculture, fish farming, is going to be a part of our future.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
A lot of arguments against it:

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Fish farms pollute -- most of them do anyway --

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and they're inefficient. Take tuna,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
a major drawback.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
It's got a feed conversion ratio

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
of 15 to one.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
That means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
to get you one pound of farm tuna.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Not very sustainable.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
It doesn't taste very good either.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
So here, finally,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
was a company trying to do it right.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I wanted to support them.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
The day before the event,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I called the head of P.R. for the company.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Let's call him Don.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
"Don," I said, "just to get the facts straight, you guys are famous

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
for farming so far out to sea, you don't pollute."

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
"That's right," he said. "We're so far out,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
the waste from our fish gets distributed,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
not concentrated."

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And then he added,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
"We're basically a world unto ourselves.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
That feed conversion ratio? 2.5 to one," he said.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
"Best in the business."

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
2.5 to one, great.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
"2.5 what? What are you feeding?"

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
"Sustainable proteins," he said.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
"Great," I said. Got off the phone.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And that night, I was lying in bed, and I thought:

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
What the hell is a sustainable protein?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
(Laughter)

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
So the next day, just before the event, I called Don.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
I said, "Don, what are some examples of sustainable proteins?"

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
He said he didn't know. He would ask around.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Well, I got on the phone with a few people in the company;

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
no one could give me a straight answer

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
until finally, I got on the phone

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
with the head biologist.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Let's call him Don too.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
(Laughter)

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
"Don," I said,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
"what are some examples of sustainable proteins?"

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Well, he mentioned some algaes

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
and some fish meals,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and then he said chicken pellets.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
I said, "Chicken pellets?"

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
He said, "Yeah, feathers, skin,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
bone meal, scraps,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
dried and processed into feed."

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
I said, "What percentage

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
of your feed is chicken?"

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Thinking, you know, two percent.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
"Well, it's about 30 percent," he said.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
I said, "Don, what's sustainable

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
about feeding chicken to fish?"

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
(Laughter)

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
There was a long pause on the line,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and he said, "There's just too much chicken in the world."

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000
(Laughter)

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
I fell out of love with this fish.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
(Laughter)

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
No, not because I'm some self-righteous,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
goody-two shoes foodie.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
I actually am.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
(Laughter)

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
No, I actually fell out of love with this fish because, I swear to God,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
after that conversation, the fish tasted like chicken.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:43.000
(Laughter)

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
This second fish,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
it's a different kind of love story.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
It's the romantic kind,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
the kind where the more you get to know your fish,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
you love the fish.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
I first ate it at a restaurant

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
in southern Spain.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
A journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
She kind of set us up.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
(Laughter)

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
It came to the table

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
a bright, almost shimmering, white color.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
The chef had overcooked it.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Like twice over.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Amazingly, it was still delicious.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Who can make a fish taste good

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
after it's been overcooked?

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
I can't,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
but this guy can.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Let's call him Miguel --

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
actually his name is Miguel.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
(Laughter)

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
And no, he didn't cook the fish, and he's not a chef,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
at least in the way that you and I understand it.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
He's a biologist

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
at Veta La Palma.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
It's a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
It's at the tip of the Guadalquivir river.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Until the 1980s,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
the farm was in the hands of the Argentinians.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
They raised beef cattle

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
on what was essentially wetlands.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
They did it by draining the land.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
They built this intricate series of canals,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
and they pushed water off the land and out into the river.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Well, they couldn't make it work,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
not economically.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
And ecologically, it was a disaster.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
It killed like 90 percent of the birds,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
which, for this place, is a lot of birds.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And so in 1982,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
a Spanish company with an environmental conscience

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
purchased the land.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
What did they do?

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
They reversed the flow of water.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
They literally flipped the switch.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Instead of pushing water out,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
they used the channels to pull water back in.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
They flooded the canals.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
They created a 27,000-acre fish farm --

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
bass, mullet,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
shrimp, eel --

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
and in the process, Miguel and this company

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
completely reversed the ecological destruction.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
The farm's incredible.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
I mean, you've never seen anything like this.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
You stare out at a horizon

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
that is a million miles away,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
and all you see are flooded canals

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and this thick, rich marshland.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
I was there not long ago with Miguel.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
He's an amazing guy,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
like three parts Charles Darwin and one part Crocodile Dundee.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
(Laughter)

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Okay? There we are slogging through the wetlands,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
and I'm panting and sweating, got mud up to my knees,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
and Miguel's calmly conducting a biology lecture.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Here, he's pointing out a rare Black-shouldered Kite.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Now, he's mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
And here, here he sees a grouping pattern

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
that reminds him of the Tanzanian Giraffe.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
It turns out, Miguel spent the better part of his career

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
in the Mikumi National Park in Africa.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
I asked him how he became

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
such an expert on fish.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
He said, "Fish? I didn't know anything about fish.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
I'm an expert in relationships."

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
And then he's off, launching into more talk

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
about rare birds and algaes

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
and strange aquatic plants.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
And don't get me wrong, that was really fascinating, you know,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
the biotic community unplugged, kind of thing.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
It's great, but I was in love.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And my head was swooning over that

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
overcooked piece of delicious fish I had the night before.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
So I interrupted him. I said,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
"Miguel, what makes your fish taste so good?"

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
He pointed at the algae.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
"I know, dude, the algae, the phytoplankton,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
the relationships: It's amazing.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
But what are your fish eating?

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
What's the feed conversion ratio?"

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Well, he goes on to tell me

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
it's such a rich system

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
that the fish are eating what they'd be eating in the wild.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
The plant biomass, the phytoplankton,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
the zooplankton, it's what feeds the fish.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
The system is so healthy,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
it's totally self-renewing.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
There is no feed.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Ever heard of a farm that doesn't feed its animals?

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Later that day, I was driving around this property with Miguel,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
and I asked him, I said, "For a place that seems so natural,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
unlike like any farm I'd ever been at,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
how do you measure success?"

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
At that moment, it was as if

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
a film director called for a set change.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
And we rounded the corner

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
and saw the most amazing sight:

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
thousands and thousands of pink flamingos,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
"That's success," he said.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
"Look at their bellies, pink.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
They're feasting."

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Feasting? I was totally confused.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
I said, "Miguel, aren't they feasting on your fish?"

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
(Laughter)

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
"Yes," he said.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:09.000
(Laughter)

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
"We lose 20 percent of our fish

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
and fish eggs to birds.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Well, last year, this property

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
had 600,000 birds on it,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
more than 250 different species.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
It's become, today, the largest

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
and one of the most important

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
private bird sanctuaries in all of Europe."

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
I said, "Miguel, isn't a thriving bird population

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
like the last thing you want on a fish farm?"

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
(Laughter)

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
He shook his head, no.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
He said, "We farm extensively,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
not intensively.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
This is an ecological network.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
The flamingos eat the shrimp.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
The shrimp eat the phytoplankton.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
So the pinker the belly,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
the better the system."

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Okay, so let's review:

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
a farm that doesn't feed its animals,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
and a farm that measures its success

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
on the health of its predators.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
A fish farm, but also a bird sanctuary.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Oh, and by the way, those flamingos,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
they shouldn't even be there in the first place.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
They brood in a town

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
150 miles away,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
where the soil conditions

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
are better for building nests.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Every morning, they fly

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
150 miles into the farm.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
And every evening, they fly 150 miles back.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
(Laughter)

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
They do that because they're able to follow

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
the broken white line

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
of highway A92.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
(Laughter)

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
No kidding.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
I was imagining a "March of the Penguins" thing,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
so I looked at Miguel.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
I said, "Miguel, do they fly

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
150 miles to the farm,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
and then do they fly

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
150 miles back at night?

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Do they do that for the children?"

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
He looked at me like I had just quoted a Whitney Houston song.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
(Laughter)

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
He said, "No; they do it because the food's better."

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
(Laughter)

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
I didn't mention the skin of my beloved fish,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
which was delicious -- and I don't like fish skin;

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
I don't like it seared, I don't like it crispy.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
It's that acrid, tar-like flavor.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
I almost never cook with it.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Yet, when I tasted it at that restaurant in southern Spain,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
it tasted not at all like fish skin.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
It tasted sweet and clean,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
like you were taking a bite of the ocean.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
I mentioned that to Miguel, and he nodded.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
He said, "The skin acts like a sponge.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
It's the last defense before anything enters the body.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
It evolved to soak up impurities."

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
And then he added,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
"But our water has no impurities."

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
OK. A farm that doesn't feed its fish,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
a farm that measures its success

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
by the success of its predators.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
And then I realized when he says,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
"A farm that has no impurities,"

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
he made a big understatement,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
because the water that flows through that farm

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
comes in from the Guadalquivir River.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
It's a river that carries with it

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
all the things that rivers tend to carry these days:

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
chemical contaminants,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
pesticide runoff.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
And when it works its way through the system

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
and leaves,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
the water is cleaner than when it entered.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
The system is so healthy, it purifies the water.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
So, not just a farm that doesn't feed its animals,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
not just a farm that measures its success

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
by the health of its predators,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
but a farm that's literally a water purification plant --

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
and not just for those fish,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
but for you and me as well.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Because when that water leaves, it dumps out into the Atlantic.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
A drop in the ocean, I know,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
but I'll take it, and so should you,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
because this love story,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
however romantic,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
is also instructive.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
You might say it's a recipe

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
for the future of good food,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
whether we're talking about bass or beef cattle.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
What we need now is

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
a radically new conception of agriculture,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
one in which the food actually tastes good.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
(Laughter)

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:47.000
(Applause)

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
But for a lot people,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
that's a bit too radical.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
We're not realists, us foodies;

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
we're lovers.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
We love farmers' markets,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
we love small family farms,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
we talk about local food,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
we eat organic.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
And when you suggest these are the things

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
that will ensure the future of good food,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
someone, somewhere stands up and says,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
"Hey guy, I love pink flamingos,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
but how are you going to feed the world?"

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
How are you going to feed the world?

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Can I be honest?

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
I don't love that question.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
No, not because we already produce

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
enough calories to more than feed the world.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
One billion people will go hungry today.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
One billion -- that's more than ever before --

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
because of gross inequalities in distribution,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
not tonnage.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Now, I don't love this question because it's determined the logic

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
of our food system for the last 50 years.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Feed grain to herbivores,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
pesticides to monocultures, chemicals to soil,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
chicken to fish,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
and all along agribusiness

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
has simply asked,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
"If we're feeding more people more cheaply,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
how terrible could that be?"

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
That's been the motivation,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
it's been the justification:

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
it's been the business plan

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
of American agriculture.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
We should call it what it is:

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
a business in liquidation,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
a business that's quickly eroding

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
ecological capital that makes that very production possible.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
That's not a business,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
and it isn't agriculture.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Our breadbasket is threatened today,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
not because of diminishing supply,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
but because of diminishing resources.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Not by the latest combine and tractor invention,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
but by fertile land;

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
not by pumps, but by fresh water;

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
not by chainsaws, but by forests;

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
and not by fishing boats and nets, but by fish in the sea.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Want to feed the world?

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Let's start by asking: How are we going to feed ourselves?

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Or better: How can we create conditions

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
that enable every community

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
to feed itself?

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:17.000
(Applause)

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
To do that,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
don't look at the agribusiness model for the future.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
It's really old, and it's tired.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
It's high on capital, chemistry and machines,

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
and it's never produced anything really good to eat.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Instead, let's look to the ecological model.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
That's the one that relies on two billion years

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
of on-the-job experience.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Look to Miguel,

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
farmers like Miguel.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
Farms that aren't worlds unto themselves;

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000
farms that restore instead of deplete;

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
farms that farm extensively

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
instead of just intensively;

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
farmers that are not just producers,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
but experts in relationships.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Because they're the ones

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
that are experts in flavor, too.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
And if I'm going to be really honest,

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
they're a better chef than I'll ever be.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
You know, I'm okay with that,

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
because if that's the future of good food, it's going to be delicious.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Thank you.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:39.000
(Applause)
