WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
OK. We've heard a lot of people

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
speak at this conference

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
about the power of the human mind.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And what I'd like to do today

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
is give you a vivid example

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
of how that power can be unleashed

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
when someone is in a survival situation,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
how the will to survive can bring that out in people.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
This is an incident which occurred on Mount Everest;

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
it was the worst disaster in the history of Everest.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And when it occurred, I was the only doctor on the mountain.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So I'll take you through that

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and we'll see what it's like

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
when someone really

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
summons the will to survive.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
OK, this is Mount Everest.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It's 29,035 feet high.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I've been there six times: Four times I did work with National Geographic,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
making tectonic plate measurements;

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
twice, I went with NASA

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
doing remote sensing devices.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
It was on my fourth trip to Everest

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
that a comet passed over the mountain. Hyakutake.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And the Sherpas told us then

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
that was a very bad omen,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and we should have listened to them.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Everest is an extreme environment.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
There's only one-third as much oxygen at the summit as there is at sea level.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Near the summit, temperatures

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
can be 40 degrees below zero.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
You can have winds 20 to 40 miles an hour.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
It's actually a wind-chill factor

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
which is lower than a summer day on Mars.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I remember one time being up near the summit,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I reached into my down jacket

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
for a drink from my water bottle,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
inside my down jacket,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
only to discover that the water was already frozen solid.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
That gives you an idea of just how severe

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
things are near the summit.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
OK, this is the route up Everest.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
It starts at base camp, at 17,500 feet.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Camp One, 2,000 feet higher.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Camp Two, another 2,000 feet higher up,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
what's called the Western Cwm.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
CampThree is at the base of Lhotse,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
which is the fourth highest mountain in the world, but it's dwarfed by Everest.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And then Camp Four is the highest camp;

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
that's 3,000 feet short of the summit.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
This is a view of base camp.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
This is pitched on a glacier at 17,500 feet.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
It's the highest point you can bring your yaks

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
before you have to unload.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And this is what they unloaded for me:

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I had four yak loads of medical supplies,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
which are dumped in a tent,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and here I am trying to arrange things.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
This was our expedition.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
It was a National Geographic expedition,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
but it was organized by The Explorers Club.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
There were three other expeditions on the mountain,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
an American team, a New Zealand team

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
and an IMAX team.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And, after actually two months of preparation,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
we built our camps all the way up the mountain.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
This is a view looking up the icefall,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
the first 2,000 feet of the climb

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
up from base camp.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And here's a picture in the icefall;

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
it's a waterfall, but it's frozen, but it moves very slowly,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and it actually changes every day.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
When you're in it, you're like a rat in a maze;

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
you can't even see over the top.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
This is near the top of the icefall.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
You want to climb through at night when the ice is frozen.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
That way, it's less likely to tumble down on you.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
These are some climbers reaching the top of the icefall just at sun-up.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
This is me crossing a crevasse.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
We cross on aluminum ladders with safety ropes attached.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
That's another crevasse.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Some of these things are 10 stories deep or more,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
and one of my climbing friends says that

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
the reason we actually climb at night

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
is because if we ever saw the bottom

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
of what we're climbing over,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
we would never do it.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Okay. This is Camp One.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
It's the first flat spot you can reach

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
after you get up to the top of the icefall.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And from there we climb up to Camp Two,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
which is sort of the foreground.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
These are climbers moving up the Lhotse face,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
that mountain toward Camp Three.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
They're on fixed ropes here.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
A fall here, if you weren't roped in,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
would be 5,000 feet down.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
This is a view taken from camp three.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
You can see the Lhotse face is in profile,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
it's about a 45 degree angle. It takes two days to climb it,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
so you put the camp halfway through.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
If you notice, the summit of Everest is black.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
There's no ice over it.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And that's because Everest is so high,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
it's in the jet stream,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
and winds are constantly scouring the face,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
so no snow gets to accumulate.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
What looks like a cloud behind the summit ridge

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
is actually snow being blown off the summit.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
This is on the way up from Camp Three to Camp Four,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
moving in, up through the clouds.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
And this is at Camp Four.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Once you get to Camp Four, you have maybe 24 hours

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
to decide if you're going to go for the summit or not.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Everybody's on oxygen, your supplies are limited,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
and you either have to go up or go down,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
make that decision very quickly.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
This is a picture of Rob Hall.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
He was the leader of the New Zealand team.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
This is a radio he used later to call his wife

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
that I'll tell you about.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
These are some climbers waiting to go to the summit.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
They're up at Camp Four, and you can see that there's wind blowing off the summit.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
This is not good weather to climb in,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
so the climbers are just waiting, hoping that the wind's going to die down.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
And, in fact, the wind does die down at night.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
It becomes very calm, there's no wind at all.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
This looks like a good chance to go for the summit.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
So here are some climbers starting out for the summit

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
on what's called the Triangular Face.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
It's the first part of climb.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
It's done in the dark, because it's actually less steep than what comes next,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
and you can gain daylight hours if you do this in the dark.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
So that's what happened.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
The climbers got on the southeast ridge.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
This is the view looking at the southeast ridge.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
The summit would be in the foreground.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
From here, it's about 1,500 feet

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
up at a 30-degree angle to the summit.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
But what happened that year was

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
the wind suddenly and unexpectedly picked up.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
A storm blew in that no one was anticipating.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
You can see here some ferocious winds

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
blowing snow way high off the summit.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And there were climbers on that summit ridge.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
This is a picture of me in that area

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
taken a year before,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
and you can see I've got an oxygen mask on

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
with a rebreather.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
I have an oxygen hose connected here.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
You can see on this climber, we have two oxygen tanks in the backpack --

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
little titanium tanks, very lightweight --

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
and we're not carrying much else.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
This is all you've got. You're very exposed on the summit ridge.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
OK, this is a view taken on the summit ridge itself.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
This is on the way toward the summit,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
on that 1,500-foot bridge.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
All the climbers here are climbing unroped,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
and the reason is because

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
the drop off is so sheer on either side

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
that if you were roped to somebody,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
you'd wind up just pulling them off with you.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
So each person climbs individually.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And it's not a straight path at all,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
it's very difficult climbing,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
and there's always the risk

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
of falling on either side.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
If you fall to your left, you're going to fall

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
8,000 feet into Nepal;

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
if you fall to your right,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
you're going to fall 12,000 feet into Tibet.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
So it's probably better to fall into Tibet

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
because you'll live longer.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
(Laughter)

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
But, either way, you fall for the rest of your life.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
OK. Those climbers were up near the summit,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
along that summit ridge that you see up there,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
and I was down here in Camp Three.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
My expedition was down in Camp Three,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
while these guys were up there in the storm.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
The storm was so fierce that we had to lay,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
fully dressed, fully equipped,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
laid out on the tent floor

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
to stop the tent from blowing off the mountain.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
It was the worst winds I've ever seen.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And the climbers up on the ridge

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
were that much higher, 2,000 feet higher,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
and completely exposed to the elements.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
We were in radio contact with some of them.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
This is a view taken along the summit ridge.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Rob Hall, we heard by radio,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
was up here, at this point in the storm

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
with Doug Hansen.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And we heard that Rob was OK,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
but Doug was too weak to come down.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
He was exhausted, and Rob was staying with him.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
We also got some bad news in the storm

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
that Beck Weathers, another climber,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
had collapsed in the snow and was dead.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
There were still 18 other climbers

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
that we weren't aware of their condition.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
They were lost. There was total confusion on the mountain;

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
all the stories were confusing, most of them were conflicting.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
We really had no idea what was going on during that storm.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
We were just hunkered down

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
in our tents at Camp Three.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Our two strongest climbers, Todd Burleson and Pete Athans,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
decided to go up to try to rescue who they could

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
even though there was a ferocious storm going.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
They tried to radio a message to Rob Hall,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
who was a superb climber

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
stuck, sort of, with a weak climber

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
up near the summit.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
I expected them to say to Rob,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
"Hold on. We're coming."

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
But in fact, what they said was,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
"Leave Doug and come down yourself.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
There's no chance of saving him,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
and just try to save yourself at this point."

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
And Rob got that message,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
but his answer was,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
"We're both listening."

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Todd and Pete got up to the summit ridge, up in here,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
and it was a scene of complete chaos up there.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
But they did what they could to stabilize the people.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
I gave them radio advice from Camp Three,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
and we sent down the climbers that could make it down

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
under their own power.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
The ones that couldn't we just sort of decided to leave up at Camp Four.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
So the climbers were coming down along this route.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
This is taken from Camp Three, where I was.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
And they all came by me

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
so I could take a look at them and see what I could do for them,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
which is really not much, because Camp Three

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
is a little notch cut in the ice

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
in the middle of a 45-degree angle.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
You can barely stand outside the tent.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
It's really cold; it's 24,000 feet.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
The only supplies I had at that altitude

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
were two plastic bags

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
with preloaded syringes

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
of painkiller and steroids.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
So, as the climbers came by me,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
I sort of assessed whether or not they were in condition

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
to continue on further down.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
The ones that weren't that lucid or were not that well coordinated,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
I would give an injection of steroids

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
to try to give them some period

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
of lucidity and coordination

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
where they could then work their way further down the mountain.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
It's so awkward to work up there that sometimes

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
I even gave the injections right through their clothes.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
It was just too hard to maneuver

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
any other way up there.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
While I was taking care of them,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
we got more news about Rob Hall.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
There was no way we could get up high enough to rescue him.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
He called in to say that he was alone now.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Apparently, Doug had died higher up on the mountain.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
But Rob was now too weak to come down himself,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
and with the fierce winds and up at that altitude,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
he was just beyond rescue

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
and he knew it.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
At that point, he asked

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
to be paged into his wife.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
He was carrying a radio.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
His wife was home in New Zealand,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
seven months pregnant with their first child,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
and Rob asked to be patched into her. That was done,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
and Rob and his wife

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
had their last conversation.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
They picked the name for their baby.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Rob then signed off,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
and that was the last we ever heard of him.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
I was faced with treating a lot of critically ill patients

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
at 24,000 feet,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
which was an impossibility.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
So what we did was, we got the victims

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
down to 21,000 feet, where it was easier for me to treat them.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
This was my medical kit.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
It's a tackle box filled with medical supplies.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
This is what I carried up the mountain.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
I had more supplies lower down,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
which I asked to be brought up to meet me at the lower camp.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
And this was scene at the lower camp.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
The survivors came in one by one.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Some of them were hypothermic,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
some of them were frostbitten, some were both.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
What we did was try to warm them up as best we could,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
put oxygen on them and try to revive them,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
which is difficult to do at 21,000 feet,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
when the tent is freezing.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
This is some severe frostbite on the feet,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
severe frostbite on the nose.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
This climber was snow blind.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
As I was taking care of these climbers,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000
we got a startling experience.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Out of nowhere, Beck Weathers,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
who we had already been told was dead,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
stumbled into the tent,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
just like a mummy, he walked into the tent.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
I expected him to be incoherent,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
but, in fact, he walked into the tent and said to me,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
"Hi, Ken. Where should I sit?"

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
And then he said,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
"Do you accept my health insurance?"

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
(Laughter)

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
He really said that.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
(Laughter)

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
So he was completely lucid, but he was very severely frostbitten.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
You can see his hand is completely white;

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
his face, his nose, is burned.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
First, it turns white, and then when it's completed necrosis,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
it turns black, and then it falls off.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
It's the last stage, just like a scar.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
So, as I was taking care of Beck,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
he related what had been going on up there.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
He said he had gotten lost in the storm,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
collapsed in the snow,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
and just laid there, unable to move.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Some climbers had come by and looked at him,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
and he heard them say, "He's dead."

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
But Beck wasn't dead; he heard that,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
but he was completely unable to move.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
He was in some sort of catatonic state

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
where he could be aware of his surroundings,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
but couldn't even blink to indicate that he was alive.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
So the climbers passed him by,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
and Beck lay there for a day, a night

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
and another day,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
in the snow.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
And then he said to himself,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
"I don't want to die.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
I have a family to come back to."

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
And the thoughts of his family,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
his kids and his wife,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
generated enough energy,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
enough motivation in him,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
so that he actually got up.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
After laying in the snow that long a time,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
he got up and found his way back to the camp.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
And Beck told me that story very quietly,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
but I was absolutely stunned by it.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
I couldn't imagine anybody laying in the snow

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
that long a time

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
and then getting up.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
He apparently reversed

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
an irreversible hypothermia.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
And I can only try to speculate

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
on how he did it.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
So, what if we had Beck

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
hooked up to a SPECT scan,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
something that could actually measure brain function?

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Just very simply, the three parts of the brain:

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
the frontal lobe, where you focus

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
your attention and concentration;

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
you have the temporal lobe,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
where you form images and keep memories;

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
and the posterior part of your brain,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
which contains the cerebellum, which controls motion;

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
and the brain stem,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
where you have your basic maintenance functions,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
like heartbeat and respiration.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
So let's take a cut through the brain here,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
and imagine that Beck

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
was hooked up to a SPECT scan.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
This measures dynamic blood flow

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
and therefore energy flow within the brain.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
So you have the prefrontal cortex here,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
lighting up in red.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
This is a pretty evenly distributed scan.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
You have the middle area,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
where the temporal lobe might be, in here,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
and the posterior portion, where the maintenance functions are in the back.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
This is a roughly normal scan,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
showing equal distribution of energy.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Now, you go to this one and you see how much more

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
the frontal lobes are lighting up.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
This might be what Beck would be experiencing

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
when he realizes he's in danger.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
He's focusing all his attention

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
on getting himself out of trouble.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
These parts of the brain are quieting down.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
He's not thinking about his family or anybody else at this point,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
and he's working pretty hard.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
He's trying to get his muscles going and get out of this.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
OK, but he's losing ground here.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
He's running out of energy.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
It's too cold; he can't keep his metabolic fires going,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
and, you see, there's no more red here;

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
his brain is quieting down.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
He's collapsed in the snow here. Everything is quiet,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
there's very little red anywhere.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Beck is powering down.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
He's dying.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
You go on to the next scan,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
but, in Beck's case,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
you can see that the middle part of his brain

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
is beginning to light up again.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
He's beginning to think about his family.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
He's beginning to have images

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
that are motivating him to get up.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
He's developing energy in this area

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
through thought.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
And this is how he's going to turn thought

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
back into action.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
This part of the brain is called the anterior cingulate gyrus.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
It's an area in which

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
a lot of neuroscientists believe

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
the seat of will exists.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
This is where people make decisions, where they develop willpower.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
And, you can see, there's an energy flow

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
going from the mid portion of his brain,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
where he's got images of his family,

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
into this area, which is powering his will.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Okay. This is getting stronger and stronger

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
to the point where it's actually

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
going to be a motivating factor.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
He's going to develop enough energy in that area --

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
after a day, a night and a day --

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
to actually motivate himself to get up.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
And you can see here,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
he's starting to get more energy into the frontal lobe.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
He's beginning to focus, he can concentrate now.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
He's thinking about what he's got to do to save himself.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
So this energy has been transmitted

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
up toward the front of his brain,

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
and it's getting quieter down here,

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
but he's using this energy

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
to think about what he has to do to get himself going.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
And then, that energy is sort of spreading

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
throughout his thought areas.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
He's not thinking about his family now, and he's getting himself motivated.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
This is the posterior part, where his muscles are going to be moving,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
and he's going to be pacing himself.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
His heart and lungs are going to pick up speed.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
So this is what I can speculate might have been going on

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
had we been able to do a SPECT scan on Beck

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
during this survival epic.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
So here I am taking care of Beck at 21,000 feet,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
and I felt what I was doing was completely trivial

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
compared to what he had done for himself.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
It just shows you what the power of the mind can do.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
He was critically ill, there were other critically ill patients;

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
luckily, we were able to get a helicopter

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
in to rescue these guys.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
A helicopter came in at 21,000 feet

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
and carried out the highest helicopter rescue in history.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
It was able to land on the ice, take away Beck

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
and the other survivors, one by one,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
and get them off to Kathmandu in a clinic

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
before we even got back to base camp.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
This is a scene at base camp,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
at one of the camps

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
where some of the climbers were lost.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
And we had a memorial service there

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
a few days later.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
These are Serphas lighting juniper branches.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
They believe juniper smoke is holy.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000
And the climbers stood around on the high rocks

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000
and spoke of the climbers who were lost

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
up near the summit,

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
turning to the mountain, actually, to talk to them directly.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
There were five climbers lost here.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000
This was Scott Fischer,

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Rob Hall,

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Andy Harris,

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
Doug Hansen

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
and Yasuko Namba.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
And one more climber

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
should have died that day, but didn't,

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
and that's Beck Weathers.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
He was able to survive

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000
because he was able to generate that incredible willpower,

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000
he was able to use all the power of his mind

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
to save himself.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
These are Tibetan prayer flags.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
These Sherpas believe that

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
if you write prayers on these flags,

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000
the message will be carried up to the gods,

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
and that year, Beck's message was answered.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Thank you.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
(Applause)
