00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
For some time I have been interested in

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
the placebo effect,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
which might seem like an odd thing

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
for a magician to be interested in,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
unless you think of it in the terms that I do,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
which is, "Something fake

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
is believed in enough by somebody

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
that it becomes something real."

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
In other words, sugar pills

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
the placebo effect,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
just because the person thinks

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
that what's happening to them is a pharmaceutical

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
or some sort of a --

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
for pain management, for example,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
if they believe it enough there is a measurable effect in the body

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
called the placebo effect.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Something fake becomes

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
something real

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
because of someone's perception of it.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
In order for us to understand each other,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I want to start by showing you a rudimentary,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
very simple magic trick.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And I'm going to show you how it works. This is a trick

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
that's been in every children's magic book since at least the 1950s.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I learned it myself from Cub Scout Magic in the 1970s.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I'll do it for you, and then I'll explain it.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And then I'll explain why I explained it.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So, here's what happens.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
The knife, which you can examine; my hand, which you could examine.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I'm just going to hold the knife in my fist like this.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I'll get my sleeve back.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I'm just going to squeeze my wrist right here.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
That way you can see that at no time

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
can anything travel, as long as I'm squeezing there

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
nothing can go up or down my sleeve.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And the object of this is quite simple.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I'm going to open my hand,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and hopefully, if all is well,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
my pure animal magnetism will hold the knife.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
In fact it's held so tightly in place

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
that I can shake it,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and the knife does not come off.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Nothing goes up or down my sleeve,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
no trickery. And you can examine everything.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Ta-da!

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
(Applause)

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
So, this is a trick that I often teach to young children

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
that are interested in magic, because you can learn

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
a great deal about deception by studying

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
this very -- even though it's a very simple trick methodologically.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Probably many of you in the room know this trick.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
What happens is this.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
I hold the knife in my hand.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I say I'm going to grab hold of my wrist

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
that is a lie.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
The reason I'm holding onto my wrist

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
is because that's actually the secret

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
of the illusion.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
In a moment when my hand moves from facing you

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
to being away from you,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
this finger right here, my index finger is just going to shift

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
from where it is, to a position

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
pointing out like this.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Nice one.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Someone who didn't have a childhood is out there.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
(Laughter)

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
So, it goes like this, from here, right.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And as I move around my finger shifts.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And we could talk about why this is deceptive,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
why you don't notice there are only three fingers down here,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
because the mind, and the way it processes information,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
it doesn't count, one, two, three. It groups them.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
But that's not really what this is about. Right? And then I open my hand up.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Obviously it's clinging there, not by animal magnetism,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
but by chicanery,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
my index finger being there.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And then when I close my finger, same thing,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
as I move back, this motion

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
kind of covers the moving back of my finger.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
I take this hand away. You give the knife out.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
There is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors. Thanks.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Now, (Laughter)

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
what does that have to do with the placebo effect?

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I read a study a year or so ago

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
that really blew my mind wide open.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
I'm not a doctor or a researcher, so this, to me,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
was an astonishing thing.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
It turns out that if you administer

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
a placebo in the form of a white pill,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
that's like aspirin shaped --

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
it's just a round white pill -- it has some certain measurable effect.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
But if you change the form that you give the placebo in,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
like you make a smaller pill,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
and color it blue, and stamp a letter into it,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
it is actually measurably more effective.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Even though neither one of these things

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
has any pharmaceutical -- they're sugar pills.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
But a white pill is not as good as a blue pill.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
What? (Laughter) That really flipped me out.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Turns out though, that that's not even where it stops.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
If you have capsules,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
they're more effective than tablets in any form.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
A colored capsule, that's yellow on one end and red on the other

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
is better than a white capsule.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Dosage has something to do with this.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
One pill twice a day

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
is not as good at three pills --

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
I don't remember the statistic now. Sorry.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
But the point is ...

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
(Laughter) ... these dosages have something to do with it.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And the form has something to do with it.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
And if you want the ultimate in placebo,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
you've go to the needle.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Right? A syringe with some inert --

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
a couple CCs of some inert something,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
and you inject this into a patient ...

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Well this is such a powerful image in their mind,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
it's so much stronger than the white pill.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
It's a really, this graph, well I'll show it to you

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
some other time when we have slides.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
The point is

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
the white pill is not as good as the blue pill

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
is not as good as the capsule is not as good as the needle.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
And none of it has any real pharmaceutical quality,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
it's only your belief that makes it real

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
in your body and makes a stronger effect.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
I wanted to see if I could take that idea

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
and apply it to a magic trick.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
And take something that is obviously a fake trick

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
and make it seem real.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
And we know from that study

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
that when you want reality, you go to the needle.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
This is a seven-inch hatpin. It's very, very sharp,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
and I'm going to just sterilize it a tiny bit.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
This is really my flesh. This is not

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Damian's special-grown flesh.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
That's my skin right there. This is not a Hollywood special effect.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
I'm going to pierce my skin

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
and run this needle through to the other side.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
If you're queasy -- (Laughs)

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
if you faint easily -- I was doing this for some friends

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
in the hotel room last night, and some people that I didn't know,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
and one woman almost passed out.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
So, I suggest if you get queasy easy

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
that you look away for about the next 30 --

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
in fact, you know what, I'll do the first bad part behind it.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
You'll get to see, you can look away too if you'd like to.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
So, here is what happens, right here,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
the beginning of my flesh

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
at the lower part of my arm I just make

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
a little pierce.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
I'm sorry, man. Am I freaking you out?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
OK, and then just through my skin a tiny bit,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
and then out the other side like this.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Now, essentially we're in the same position we were in

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
with the knife trick.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
(Laughter)

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Sort of.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
But you can't count my fingers right now can you?

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
So, let me show them to you. That's one, two

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
three, four, five.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Yes, well...

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
I know what people think when they see this.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
They go, "Well, he's certainly not dumb enough

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
to stab himself through the skin to entertain us for a few minutes.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
So, let me give you a little peek.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
How's that look out there? Pretty good.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
(Laughs)

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Yeah, I know. (Laughs)

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
And the people in the back go, "OK, I didn't really see that."

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
People in the satellite room are starting to move in now.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Let me give you good close look at this.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
That really is my skin. That is not a Hollywood special effect.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
That's my flesh, and I can twist that around.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
I'm sorry. If you're getting queasy, look away,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
don't look at the thing.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
People in the back or people on video years from now watching this

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
will go, "Well yeah, that looks kind of neat

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
in some sort of effect there, but if it were real he would be --

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
see there's a hole there and a hole there, if it were real he would be bleeding.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Well let me work up some blood for you.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000
(Laughter)

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Yes, there it is.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:02.000
(Applause)

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
(Laughter)

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Normally now, I would take the needle out.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
I would clean off my arm, and I would show you that there are no wounds.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
But I think in this context

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
and with the idea of taking something fake

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
and making it into something real,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
I'm just going to leave it there,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
and walk off the stage.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
(Laughter)

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
I will be seeing you several times over the next few days.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
I hope you're looking forward to that. Thank you very much.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
(Laughter)

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
(Applause)
