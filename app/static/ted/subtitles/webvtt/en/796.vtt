00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I'm going to talk to you today about my work on suspended animation.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Now, usually when I mention suspended animation,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
people will flash me the Vulcan sign and laugh.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
But now, I'm not talking about gorking people out

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
to fly to Mars or even Pandora,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
as much fun as that may be.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I'm talking about

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
the concept of using suspended animation

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
to help people out in trauma.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So what do I mean

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
when I say "suspended animation"?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
It is the process by which

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
animals de-animate,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
appear dead

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and then can wake up again without being harmed.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
OK, so here is the sort of big idea:

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
If you look out at nature,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
you find that

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
as you tend to see suspended animation,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
you tend to see immortality.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And so, what I'm going to tell you about

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
is a way to tell a person who's in trauma --

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
find a way to de-animate them a bit

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
so they're a little more immortal

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
when they have that heart attack.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
An example of an organism or two

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
that happens to be quite immortal

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
would be plant seeds

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
or bacterial spores.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
These creatures are

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
some of the most immortal life forms on our planet,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and they tend to spend most of their time

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
in suspended animation.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Bacterial spores are thought now by scientists

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
to exist as individual cells

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
that are alive, but in suspended animation

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
for as long as 250 million years.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
To suggest that this all, sort of, about little, tiny creatures,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I want to bring it close to home.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
In the immortal germ line

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
of human beings --

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
that is, the eggs that sit in the ovaries --

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
they actually sit there in a state of suspended animation

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
for up to 50 years in the life of each woman.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
So then there's also my favorite example

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
of suspended animation.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
This is Sea-Monkeys.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Those of you with children,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
you know about them.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
You go to the pet store or the toy store,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and you can buy these things.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
You just open the bag, and you just dump them

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
into the plastic aquarium,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
and in about a week or so, you'll have little shrimps swimming around.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Well, I wasn't so interested in the swimming.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I was interested in what was going on in the bag,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
the bag on the toy store shelf

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
where those shrimp sat

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
in suspended animation indefinitely.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So these ideas of suspended animation

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
are not just about cells and weird, little organisms.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Occasionally, human beings

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
are briefly de-animated,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and the stories of people who are briefly de-animated

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
that interest me the most

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
are those having to do with the cold.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Ten years ago, there was a skier in Norway

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
that was trapped in an icy waterfall,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
and she was there for two hours before they extracted her.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
She was extremely cold,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
and she had no heartbeat --

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
for all intents and purposes she was dead, frozen.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Seven hours later,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
still without a heartbeat,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
they brought her back to life, and she went on to be

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
the head radiologist

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
in the hospital that treated her.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
A couple of years later --

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
so I get really excited about these things --

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
about a couple of years later,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
there was a 13-month-old, she was from Canada.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Her father had gone out in the wintertime; he was working night shift,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and she followed him outside in nothing but a diaper.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And they found her hours later,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
frozen, lifeless,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
and they brought her back to life.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
There was a 65-year-old woman

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
in Duluth, Minnesota last year

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
that was found frozen and without a pulse

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
in her front yard one morning in the winter,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and they brought her back to life.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
The next day, she was doing so well, they wanted to run tests on her.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
She got cranky and just went home.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
(Laughter)

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
So, these are miracles, right?

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
These are truly miraculous things that happen.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Doctors have a saying

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
that, in fact, "You're not dead until you're warm and dead."

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And it's true. It's true.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
In the New England Journal of Medicine,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
there was a study published that showed

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
that with appropriate rewarming,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
people who had suffered without a heartbeat for three hours

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
could be brought back to life without any neurologic problems.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
That's over 50 percent.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
So what I was trying to do is think of a way

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
that we could study

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
suspended animation

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
to think about a way

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
to reproduce, maybe,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
what happened to the skier.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Well, I have to tell you something very odd,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
and that is that being exposed to low oxygen

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
does not always kill.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
So, in this room, there's 20 percent oxygen or so,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
and if we reduce the oxygen concentration,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
we will all be dead.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And, in fact, the animals we were working with in the lab --

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
these little garden worms, nematodes --

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
they were also dead when we exposed them to low oxygen.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
And here's the thing that should freak you out.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
And that is that, when we lower the oxygen concentration further

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000
by 100 times, to 10 parts per million,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
they were not dead,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
they were in suspended animation,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
and we could bring them back to life without any harm.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And this precise oxygen concentration,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
10 parts per million,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
that caused suspended animation,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
is conserved.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
We can see it in a variety of different organisms.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
One of the creatures we see it in

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
is a fish.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And we can turn its heartbeat on and off by going in and out

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
of suspended animation like you would a light switch.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
So this was pretty shocking to me,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
that we could do this.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
And so I was wondering, when we were trying

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
to reproduce the work with the skier,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
that we noticed that, of course,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
she had no oxygen consumption,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
and so maybe she was in a similar state of suspended animation.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
But, of course, she was also extremely cold.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
So we wondered what would happen

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
if we took our suspended animals and exposed them to the cold.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And so, what we found out

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
was that, if you take animals

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
that are animated like you and I,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
and you make them cold -- that is, these were the garden worms --

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
now they're dead.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
But if you have them in suspended animation,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and move them into the cold, they're all alive.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And there's the very important thing there:

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
If you want to survive the cold,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
you ought to be suspended. Right?

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
It's a really good thing.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
And so, we were thinking about that,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
about this relationship between these things,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
and thinking about whether or not that's what happened to the skier.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
And so we wondered: Might there be some agent

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
that is in us, something that we make ourselves,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
that we might be able to regulate our own metabolic flexibility

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
in such a way as to be able to survive

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
when we got extremely cold, and might otherwise pass away?

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
I thought it might be interesting to sort of hunt for such things.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
You know?

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
I should mention briefly here

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
that physiology textbooks that you can read about

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
will tell you that this is a kind of heretical thing to suggest.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
We have, from the time we are slapped on the butt

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
until we take our last dying breath --

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
that's when we're newborn to when we're dead --

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
we cannot reduce our metabolic rate

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
below what's called a standard,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
or basal metabolic rate.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
But I knew that there were examples

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
of creatures, also mammals,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
that do reduce their metabolic rate

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
such as ground squirrels and bears,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
they reduce their metabolic rate

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
in the wintertime when they hibernate.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
So I wondered: Might we be able to find some agent or trigger

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
that might induce such a state in us?

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
And so, we went looking for such things.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
And this was a period of time when we failed tremendously.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Ken Robinson is here. He talked about the glories of failure.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Well, we had a lot of them.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
We tried many different chemicals and agents,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
and we failed over and over again.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
So, one time, I was at home

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
watching television on the couch

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
while my wife was putting our child to bed,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
and I was watching a television show.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
It was a television show --

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
it was a NOVA show on PBS --

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
about caves in New Mexico.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
And this particular cave was Lechuguilla,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
and this cave is incredibly toxic to humans.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
The researchers had to suit up just to enter it.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
It's filled with this toxic gas,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
hydrogen sulfide.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Now, hydrogen sulfide is curiously present in us.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
We make it ourselves.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
The highest concentration is in our brains.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Yet, it was used

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
as a chemical warfare agent in World War I.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
It's an extraordinarily toxic thing.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
In fact, in chemical accidents,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
hydrogen sulfide is known to --

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
if you breathe too much of it, you collapse to the ground,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
you appear dead,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
but if you were brought out into room air, you can be reanimated without harm,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
if they do that quickly.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000
So, I thought, "Wow, I have to get some of this."

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
(Laughter)

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Now, it's post-9/11 America,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
and when you go into the research institute,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
and you say, "Hi.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
I'd like to buy some concentrated,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
compressed gas cylinders

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
of a lethal gas

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
because I have these ideas, see,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
about wanting to suspend people.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
It's really going to be OK."

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
So that's kind of a tough day,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
but I said, "There really is

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
some basis for thinking why you might want to do this."

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
As I said, this agent is in us,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
and, in fact, here's a curious thing,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
it binds to the very place inside of your cells

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
where oxygen binds, and where you burn it,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
and that you do this burning to live.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
And so we thought, like in a game of musical chairs,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
might we be able to give a person

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
some hydrogen sulfide,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
and might it be able to occupy that place

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
like in a game of musical chairs where oxygen might bind?

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
And because you can't bind the oxygen,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
maybe you wouldn't consume it,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
and then maybe it would reduce your demand for oxygen.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
I mean, who knows?

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
So -- (Laughter)

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
So, there's the bit about the dopamine

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
and being a little bit, what do you call it, delusional,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
and you might suggest that was it.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
And so, we wanted to find out

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
might we be able to use

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
hydrogen sulfide in the presence of cold,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
and we wanted to see whether we could

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
reproduce this skier in a mammal.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Now, mammals are warm-blooded creatures,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
and when we get cold, we shake and we shiver, right?

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
We try to keep our core temperature at 37 degrees

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
by actually burning more oxygen.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
So, it was interesting for us

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
when we applied hydrogen sulfide

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
to a mouse when it was also cold

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
because what happened is the core temperature

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
of the mouse got cold.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
It stopped moving.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
It appeared dead.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Its oxygen consumption rate

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
fell by tenfold.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
And here's the really important point.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
I told you hydrogen sulfide is in us.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
It's rapidly metabolized,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
and all you have to do after six hours of being

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
in this state of de-animation

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
is simply put the thing out in room air,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
and it warms up, and it's none the worse for wear.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Now, this was cosmic.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Really. Because we had found a way

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
to de-animate a mammal,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
and it didn't hurt it.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Now, we'd found a way to reduce

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
its oxygen consumption

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
to rock-bottom levels, and it was fine.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Now, in this state of de-animation,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
it could not go out dancing,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
but it was not dead,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
and it was not harmed.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
So we started to think: Is this the agent

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
that might have been present in the skier,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
and might have she had more of it than someone else,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
and might that have been able to reduce

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
her demand for oxygen

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
before she got so cold that

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
she otherwise would have died,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
as we found out with our worm experiments?

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
So, we wondered:

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Can we do anything useful

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
with this capacity to

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
control metabolic flexibility?

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
And one of the things we wondered --

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
I'm sure some of you out there are economists,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
and you know all about supply and demand.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
And when supply is equal to demand,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
everything's fine,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
but when supply falls,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
in this case of oxygen,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
and demand stays high, you're dead.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
So, what I just told you

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
is we can now reduce demand.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
We ought to be able to lower supply

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
to unprecedented low levels without killing the animal.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
And with money we got from DARPA,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
we could show just that.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
If you give mice hydrogen sulfide,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
you can lower their demand for oxygen,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
and you can put them into oxygen concentrations

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
that are as low as 5,000 feet above the top of Mt. Everest,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
and they can sit there for hours, and there's no problem.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Well this was really cool.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
We also found out that we could subject animals

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
to otherwise lethal blood loss, and we could save them

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
if we gave them hydrogen sulfide.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
So these proof of concept experiments

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
led me to say "I should found a company,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
and we should take this out to a wider playing field."

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
I founded a company called Ikaria

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
with others' help.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
And this company, the first thing it did

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
was make a liquid formulation of hydrogen sulfide

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
an injectable form that we could put in

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
and send it out to physician scientists all over the world

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
who work on models of critical care medicine,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
and the results are incredibly positive.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
In one model of heart attack,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
animals given hydrogen sulfide

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
showed a 70 percent reduction in heart damage

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
compared to those who got the standard of care that

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
you and I would receive if we were to have a heart attack here today.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Same is true for organ failure,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
when you have loss of function owing to poor perfusion of kidney, of liver,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
acute respiratory distress syndrome

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
and damage suffered in cardiac-bypass surgery.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
So, these are the thought leaders in trauma medicine

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
all over the world saying this is true,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000
so it seems that exposure to hydrogen sulfide

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
decreases damage that you receive

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
from being exposed to otherwise lethal-low oxygen.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
And I should say that the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
required to get this benefit

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
are low, incredibly low.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
In fact, so low that physicians will not have to lower or dim

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
the metabolism of people much at all

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
to see the benefit I just mentioned,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
which is a wonderful thing, if you're thinking about adopting this.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
You don't want to be gorking people out

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
just to save them, it's really confusing.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
(Laughter)

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
So, I want to say that we're in human trials.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Now, and so --

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:12.000
(Applause)

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Thank you. The Phase 1 safety studies are over,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
and we're doing fine, we're now moved on.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
We have to get to Phase 2 and Phase 3. It's going to take us a few years.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
This has all moved very quickly,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
and the mouse experiments

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
of hibernating mice happened in 2005;

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
the first human studies were done in 2008,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
and we should know in a couple of years

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
whether it works or not.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
And this all happened really quickly

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
because of a lot of help from a lot of people.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
I want to mention that, first of all,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
my wife, without whom this talk and my work would not be possible,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
so thank you very much.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Also, the brilliant scientists who work at my lab

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
and also others on staff,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington --

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
wonderful place to work.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
And also the wonderful scientists

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
and businesspeople at Ikaria.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
One thing those people did out there

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
was take this technology of hydrogen sulfide,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
which is this start-up company that's burning venture capital very quickly,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
and they fused it with another company

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
that sells another toxic gas

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
that's more toxic than hydrogen sulfide,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
and they give it to newborn babies who would otherwise die

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
from a failure to be able to oxygenate their tissues properly.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
And this gas that is delivered in over

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
a thousand critical care hospitals worldwide,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
now is approved, on label,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
and saves thousands of babies a year

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
from certain death.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
(Applause)

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
So it's really incredible

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
for me to be a part of this.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
And I want to say that I think we're on the path

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
of understanding metabolic flexibility

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
in a fundamental way,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
and that in the not too distant future,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
an EMT might give an injection of hydrogen sulfide,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
or some related compound,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
to a person suffering severe injuries,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
and that person might de-animate a bit,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
they might become a little more immortal.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Their metabolism will fall

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:11.000
as though you were dimming a switch on a lamp at home.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
And then, they will have the time, that will buy them the time,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
to be transported to the hospital

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
to get the care they need.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000
And then, after they get that care --

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
like the mouse, like the skier,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
like the 65-year-old woman --

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
they'll wake up.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
A miracle?

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
We hope not, or maybe we just hope

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
to make miracles a little more common.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
Thank you very much.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:49.000
(Applause)
