00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
If you think about the phone --

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
and Intel has tested

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
a lot of the things I'm going to show you,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
over the last 10 years,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
in about 600 elderly households --

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
300 in Ireland, and 300 in Portland --

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
trying to understand: How do we measure

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and monitor behavior

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
in a medically meaningful way?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And if you think about the phone, right,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
it's something that we can use for some incredible ways

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
to help people actually take the right medication at the right time.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We're testing these kinds of simple

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
sensor-network technologies in the home

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
so that any phone that a senior is already comfortable with

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
can help them deal with their medications.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And a lot of what they do is they pick up the phone,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and it's our system whispering to them which pill they need to take,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and they fake like they're having a conversation with a friend.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And they're not embarrassed by a meds caddy that's ugly,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
that sits on their kitchen table and says,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
"I'm old. I'm frail."

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It's surreptitious technology

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
that's helping them do a simple task

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
of taking the right pill at the right time.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Now, we also do some pretty amazing things with these phones.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Because that moment when you answer the phone

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
is a cognitive test every time that you do it.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Think about it, all right? I'm going to answer the phone three different times.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
"Hello? Hey."

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
All right? That's the first time.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
"Hello? Uh, hey."

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
"Hello? Uh, who?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Oh, hey."

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
All right? Very big differences

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
between the way I answered the phone the three times.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And as we monitor phone usage

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
by seniors over a long period of time,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
down to the tenths of a microsecond,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
that recognition moment

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
of whether they can figure out that person on the other end

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
is a friend and we start talking to them immediately,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
or they do a lot of what's called trouble talk,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
where they're like, "Wait, who is this? Oh." Right?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Waiting for that recognition moment

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
may be the best early indicator of the onset of dementia

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
than anything that shows up clinically today.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
We call these behavioral markers.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
There's lots of others. Is the person going to the phone

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
as quickly, when it rings, as they used to?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Is it a hearing problem or is it a physicality problem?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Has their voice gotten more quiet? We're doing a lot of work with people

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
with Alzheimer's and particularly with Parkinson's,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
where that quiet voice that sometimes shows up with Parkinson's patients

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
may be the best early indicator

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
of Parkinson's five to 10 years before it shows up clinically.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
But those subtle changes in your voice over a long period of time

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
are hard for you or your spouse to notice until it becomes so extreme

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and your voice has become so quiet.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
So, sensors are looking at that kind of voice.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
When you pick up the phone,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
how much tremor are you having,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
and what is that like, and what is that trend like over a period of time?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Are you having more trouble dialing the phone than you used to?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Is it a dexterity problem? Is it the onset of arthritis?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Are you using the phone? Are you socializing less than you used to?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
And looking at that pattern. And what does that decline in social health

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
mean, as a kind of a vital sign of the future?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And then wow, what a radical idea,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
we -- except in the United States --

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
might be able to use this newfangled technology

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
to actually interact with a nurse or a doctor on the other end of the line.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Wow, what a great day that will be

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
once we're allowed to actually do those kinds of things.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
So, these are what I would call behavioral markers.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And it's the whole field that we've been trying to work on

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
for the last 10 years at Intel.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
How do you put simple disruptive technologies,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and the first of five phrases that I'm going to talk about in this talk?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Behavioral markers matter.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
How do we change behavior?

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
How do we measure changes in behavior

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
in a meaningful way that's going to help us with

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
prevention of disease, early onset of disease,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
and tracking the progression of disease over a long period of time?

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Now, why would Intel let me

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
spend a lot of time and money, over the last 10 years,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
trying to understand the needs of seniors

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
and start thinking about these kinds of behavioral markers?

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
This is some of the field work that we've done.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
We have now lived with 1,000 elderly households

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
in 20 countries over the last 10 years.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
We study people in Rochester, New York.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
We go live with them in the winter

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
because what they do in the winter,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and their access to healthcare, and how much they socialize,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
is very different than in the summer.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
If they have a hip fracture we go with them

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and we study their entire discharge experience.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
If they have a family member who is a key part of their care network,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
we fly and study them as well.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
So, we study the holistic health experience

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
of 1,000 seniors over the last 10 years

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
in 20 different countries.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Why is Intel willing to fund that?

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
It's because of the second slogan that I want to talk about.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Ten years ago, when I started trying to convince Intel

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
to let me go start looking at disruptive technologies

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
that could help with independent living,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
this is what I called it: "Y2K + 10."

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
You know, back in 2000,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
we were all so obsessed with paying attention

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
to the aging of our computers,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and whether or not they were going to survive

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
the tick of the clock from 1999 to 2000,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
that we missed a moment that only demographers were paying attention to.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
It was right around New Years.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
And that switchover,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
when we had the larger number of older people on the planet,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
for the first time than younger people.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
For the first time in human history -- and barring aliens landing

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
or some major other pandemic,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
that's the expectation from demographers, going forward.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And 10 years ago it seemed like I had a lot of time

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
to convince Intel to work on this. Right?

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Y2K + 10 was coming,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
the baby boomers starting to retire.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Well folks, it's like we know these demographics here.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
This is a map of the entire world.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
It's like the lights are on,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
but nobody's home on this demographic

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Y2K + 10 problem. Right?

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
I mean we sort of get it here, but we don't get it here,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
and we're not doing anything about it.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
The health reform bill is largely ignoring

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
the realities of the age wave that's coming,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
and the implications for what we need to do to change

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
not only how we pay for care,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
but deliver care in some radically different ways.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And in fact, it's upon us.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
I mean you probably saw these headlines. This is Catherine Casey

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
who is the first boomer to actually get Social Security.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
That actually occurred this year. She took early retirement.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
She was born one second after midnight in 1946.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
A retired school teacher,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
there she is with a Social Security administrator.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
The first boomer actually, we didn't even wait till 2011, next year.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
We're already starting to see early retirement occur this year.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
All right, so it's here. This Y2K + 10 problem is at our door.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000
This is 50 tsunamis scheduled on the calendar,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
but somehow we can't sort of marshal our government

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
and innovative forces to sort of get out in front of it

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
and do something about it. We'll wait until

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
it's more of a catastrophe, and react,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
as opposed to prepare for it.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
So, one of the reasons it's so

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
challenging to prepare for this Y2K problem

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
is, I want to argue, we have what I would call

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
mainframe poisoning.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Andy Grove, about six or seven years ago,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
he doesn't even know or remember this, in a Fortune Magazine article

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
he used the phrase "mainframe healthcare,"

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
and I've been extending and expanding this.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
He saw it written down somewhere. He's like, "Eric that's a really cool concept."

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
I was like, "Actually it was your idea. You said it in a Fortune Magazine article.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
I just extended it."

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
You know, this is the mainframe.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
This mentality of traveling to

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
and timesharing large, expensive healthcare systems

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
actually began in 1787.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
This is the first general hospital in Vienna.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
And actually the second general hospital in Vienna,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
in about 1850, was where we started to build out

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
an entire curriculum for teaching med students specialties.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And it's a place in which we started developing

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
architecture that literally divided the body,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
and divided care into departments and compartments.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
And it was reflected in our architecture,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
it was reflected in the way that we taught students,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
and this mainframe mentality persists today.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Now, I'm not anti-hospital.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
With my own healthcare problems, I've taken drug therapies,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
I've traveled to this hospital and others, many, many times.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
But we worship the high hospital on a hill. Right?

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
And this is mainframe healthcare.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
And just as 30 years ago

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
we couldn't conceive that we would have the power

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
of a mainframe computer that took up a room this size

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
in our purses and on our belts,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
that we're carrying around in our cell phone today,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
and suddenly, computing,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
that used to be an expert driven system,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
it was a personal system that we all owned as part of our daily lives --

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
that shift from mainframe to personal computing

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
is what we have to do for healthcare.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
We have to shift from this mainframe mentality of healthcare

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
to a personal model of healthcare.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
We are obsessed with this way of thinking.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
When Intel does surveys all around the world and we say,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
"Quick response: healthcare."

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
The first word that comes up is "doctor."

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
The second that comes up is "hospital." And the third is "illness" or "sickness." Right?

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000
We are wired, in our imagination, to think about healthcare

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
and healthcare innovation as something

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
that goes into that place.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Our entire health reform discussion right now,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
health I.T., when we talk with policy makers,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
equals "How are we going to get doctors using

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
electronic medical records in the mainframe?"

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
We're not thinking about

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
how do we shift from the mainframe to the home.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
And the problem with this is

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
the way we conceive healthcare. Right?

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
This is a very reactive, crisis-driven system.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
We're doing 15-minute exams with patients.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
It's population-based.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
We collect a bunch of biological information in this artificial setting,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
and we fix them up, like Humpty-Dumpty all over again,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
and send them home,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
and hope -- we might hand them a brochure, maybe an interactive website --

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
that they do as asked and don't come back into the mainframe.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
And the problem is we can't afford it today, folks.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
We can't afford mainframe healthcare today to include the uninsured.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
And now we want to do a double-double

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
of the age wave coming through?

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Business as usual in healthcare is broken and we've got to do something different.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
We've got to focus on the home.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
We've got to focus on a personal healthcare paradigm

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
that moves care to the home. How do we be more proactive,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
prevention-driven?

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000
How do we collect vital signs and other kinds of information 24 by 7?

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
How do we get a personal baseline about what's going to work for you?

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
How do we collect not just biological data

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
but behavioral data, psychological data,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
relational data, in and on and around the home?

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
And how do we drive compliance to be a customized care plan

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
that uses all this great technology that's around us

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
to change our behavior?

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
That's what we need to do for our personal health model.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
I want to give you a couple of examples. This is Mimi

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
from one of our studies --

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
in her 90s, had to move out of her home

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
because her family was worried about falls.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Raise your hand if you had a serious fall

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
in your household, or any of your loved ones,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
your parents or so forth. Right?

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Classic. Hip fracture often leads to institutionalization of a senior.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
This is what was happening to Mimi; the family was worried about it,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
moved her out of her own home into an assisted living facility.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
She tripped over her oxygen tank.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Many people in this generation won't press the button,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
even if they have an alert call system, because they don't want to bother anybody,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
even though they've been paying 30 dollars a month.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Boomers will press the button. Trust me.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
They're going to be pressing that button non-stop. Right?

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Mimi broke her pelvis, lay all night, all morning,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
finally somebody came in and found her,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
sent her to the hospital.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
They fixed her back up. She was never going to be able to move back

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
into the assisted living. They put her into the nursing home unit.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
First night in the nursing home unit where she had been

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
in the same assisted living facility, moved her from one bed to another,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
kind of threw her, rebroke her pelvis,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
sent her back to the hospital that she had just come from,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
no one read the chart, put her on Tylenol,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
which she is allergic to, broke out, got bedsores,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
basically, had heart problems, and died

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
from the fall and the complications and the errors that were there.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Now, the most frightening thing about this is

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
this is my wife's grandmother.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Now, I'm Eric Dishman. I speak English,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
I work for Intel, I make a good salary,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
I'm smart about falls and fall-related injuries --

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
it's an area of research that I work on.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
I have access to senators and CEOs.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
I can't stop this from happening.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
What happens if you don't have money, you don't speak English

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
or don't have the kind of access

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
to deal with these kinds of problems that inevitably occur?

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
How do we actually prevent the vast majority of falls

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
from ever occurring in the first place?

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Let me give you a quick example of work that we're doing

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
to try to do exactly that.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
I've been wearing a little technology that we call Shimmer.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
It's a research platform.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
It has accelerometry. You can plug in a three-lead ECG.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
There is all kinds of sort of plug-and-play

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
kind of Legos that you can do to capture, in the wild,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
in the real world,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
things like tremor, gait,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
stride length and those kinds of things.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
The problem is, our understanding of falls today,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
like Mimi, is get a survey in the mail three months after you fell,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
from the State, saying, "What were you doing when you fell?"

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
That's sort of the state of the art.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
But with something like Shimmer, or we have something called the Magic Carpet,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
embedded sensors in carpet, or camera-based systems

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
that we borrowed from sports medicine,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
we're starting for the first time in those 600 elderly households

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
to collect actual kinematic motion data

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000
to understand: What are the subtle changes that are occurring

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
that can show us that mom has become risk at falls?

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
And most often we can do two interventions,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
fix the meds mix.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
I'm a qualitative researcher, but when I look at these data streams coming in

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
from these homes, I can look at the data and tell you the day

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
that some doctor prescribed them something that nobody else

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
knew that they were on, because we see the changes

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
in their patterns in the household. Right?

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
These discoveries of behavioral markers,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
and behavioral changes

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
are game changing, and like the discovery of the microscope

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
because of our collecting data streams that we've actually never done before.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
This is an example in our TRIL Clinic in Ireland

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
of -- actually what you're seeing is

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
she's looking at data,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
in this picture, from the Magic Carpet.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
So, we have a little carpet that you can look at your amount of postural sway,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
and look at the changes in your postural sway over many months.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Here's what some of this data might look like.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
This is actually sensor firings.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
These are two different subjects in our study.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
It's about a year's worth of data.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
The color represents different rooms they are in the house.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
This person on the left is living in their own home.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
This person on the right is actually living in an assisted living facility.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
I know this because look at how punctuated meal time is

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
when they are no longer in their particular rooms here. Right?

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Now, this doesn't mean that much to you.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
But when we look at these cycles of data

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
over a longer period of time -- and we're looking at everything from

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
motion around different rooms in the house,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
to sort of micro-motions that Shimmer picks up,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
about gait and stride length -- these streams of data

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
are starting to tell us things about behavioral patterns

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
that we've never understood before.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
You can go to ORCATech.org --

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
it has nothing to do with whales, it's the Oregon Center for Aging and Technology --

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
to see more about that.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
The problem is, Intel is still one of the largest

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
funders in the world

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
of independent living technology research.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
I'm not bragging about how much we fund;

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
it's how little anyone else actually pays attention

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
to aging and funds innovation on aging,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
chronic disease management and independent living in the home.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
So, my mantra here, my fourth slogan is:

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
10,000 households or bust.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
We need to drive

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
a national, if not international, Framingham-type heart study

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
of independent living technologies,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
where we have 10,000 elderly connected households

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
with broadband, full medical characterization,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
and a platform by which we can start to experiment

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
and turn these from 20-household anecdotal studies

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
that the universities fund,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
to large clinical trials that prove out the value of these technologies.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
So, 10,000 households or bust.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
These are just some of the households that we've done in the Intel studies.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
My fifth and final phrase:

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
I have tried for two years,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
and there were moments when we were quite close,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
to make this healthcare reform bill be about reform

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
from something and to something,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
from a mainframe model

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
to a personal health model,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
or to mean something more than just a debate

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
about the public option and how we're going to finance.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
It doesn't matter how we finance healthcare.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
We're going to figure something out

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
for the next 10 years, and try it.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
No matter who pays for it,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
we better start doing care in a fundamentally different way

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
and treating the home and the patient

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
and the family member and the caregivers

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
as part of these coordinated care teams

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
and using disruptive technologies that are already here

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
to do care in some pretty fundamental different ways.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
The president needs to stand up and say,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
at the end of a healthcare reform debate,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
"Our goal as a country is to move 50 percent of care

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
out of institutions, clinics, hospitals and nursing homes,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
to the home, in 10 years."

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
It's achievable. We should do it economically,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
we should do it morally,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
and we should do it for quality of life.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
But there is no goal within this health reform.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
It's just a mess today.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
So, you know, that's my last message to you.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
How do we set a going-to-the-moon goal

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
of dealing with the Y2K +10 problem that's coming?

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
It's not that innovation and technology is going to be the

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
magic pill that cures all, but it's going to be part of the solution.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
And if we don't create a personal health movement,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
something that we're all aiming towards in reform,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
then we're going to move nowhere.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
So, I hope you'll turn this conference into that kind of movement forward.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Thanks very much.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
