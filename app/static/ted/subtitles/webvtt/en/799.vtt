WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.222
I'm Jane McGonigal. I'm a game designer.

00:00:02.246 --> 00:00:04.976
I've been making games
online now for 10 years,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.976
and my goal for the next decade

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.396
is to try to make it as easy
to save the world in real life

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.976
as it is to save the world
in online games.

00:00:16.626 --> 00:00:18.617
Now, I have a plan for this,

00:00:18.641 --> 00:00:21.554
and it entails convincing more people,

00:00:21.578 --> 00:00:26.435
including all of you, to spend more time
playing bigger and better games.

00:00:26.459 --> 00:00:30.976
Right now we spend three billion hours
a week playing online games.

00:00:31.357 --> 00:00:32.976
Some of you might be thinking,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.143
"That's a lot of time
to spend playing games.

00:00:35.167 --> 00:00:36.469
Maybe too much time,

00:00:36.493 --> 00:00:39.976
considering how many urgent problems
we have to solve in the real world."

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.976
But actually, according to my research
at the Institute for the Future,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.976
actually the opposite is true.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.325
Three billion hours a week
is not nearly enough game play

00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:52.747
to solve the world's most urgent problems.

00:00:52.771 --> 00:00:55.390
In fact, I believe
that if we want to survive

00:00:55.414 --> 00:00:56.976
the next century on this planet,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.523
we need to increase
that total dramatically.

00:00:59.547 --> 00:01:01.525
I've calculated the total we need

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:04.587
at 21 billion hours
of game play every week.

00:01:05.547 --> 00:01:08.189
So, that's probably a bit
of a counter-intuitive idea,

00:01:08.213 --> 00:01:10.754
so I'll say it again, let it sink in:

00:01:10.778 --> 00:01:12.976
If we want to solve problems like hunger,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.246
poverty, climate change,
global conflict, obesity,

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.286
I believe that we need to aspire
to play games online

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.882
for at least 21 billion hours a week,
by the end of the next decade.

00:01:23.906 --> 00:01:24.914
(Laughter)

00:01:24.938 --> 00:01:27.056
No. I'm serious. I am.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.231
Here's why.

00:01:28.255 --> 00:01:31.498
This picture pretty much sums up
why I think games are so essential

00:01:31.522 --> 00:01:33.661
to the future survival
of the human species.

00:01:33.685 --> 00:01:34.689
(Laughter)

00:01:34.713 --> 00:01:35.864
Truly.

00:01:35.888 --> 00:01:38.505
This is a portrait
by photographer Phil Toledano.

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:40.769
He wanted to capture
the emotion of gaming,

00:01:40.793 --> 00:01:43.903
so he set up a camera in front
of gamers while they were playing.

00:01:43.927 --> 00:01:46.852
And this is a classic gaming emotion.

00:01:46.876 --> 00:01:48.781
Now, if you're not a gamer,

00:01:48.805 --> 00:01:51.202
you might miss some
of the nuance in this photo.

00:01:51.226 --> 00:01:53.976
You probably see the sense of urgency,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.384
a little bit of fear,
but intense concentration,

00:01:57.408 --> 00:02:00.976
deep, deep focus on tackling
a really difficult problem.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.737
If you are a gamer, you will notice
a few nuances here:

00:02:04.761 --> 00:02:07.550
the crinkle of the eyes up,
and around the mouth

00:02:07.574 --> 00:02:09.169
is a sign of optimism,

00:02:09.193 --> 00:02:11.628
and the eyebrows up is surprise.

00:02:11.652 --> 00:02:15.779
This is a gamer who's on the verge
of something called an "epic win."

00:02:15.803 --> 00:02:16.976
(Laughter)

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.406
Oh, you've heard of that.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.962
OK, good, so we have some gamers among us.

00:02:20.986 --> 00:02:25.232
An epic win is an outcome
that is so extraordinarily positive,

00:02:25.256 --> 00:02:28.272
you had no idea it was even
possible until you achieved it.

00:02:28.296 --> 00:02:32.555
It was almost beyond the threshold
of imagination, and when you get there,

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:35.238
you're shocked to discover
what you're truly capable of.

00:02:35.262 --> 00:02:36.420
That's an epic win.

00:02:36.444 --> 00:02:38.828
This is a gamer on the verge
of an epic win.

00:02:38.852 --> 00:02:41.265
And this is the face that we need to see

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:43.976
on millions of problem-solvers
all over the world

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.321
as we try to tackle the obstacles
of the next century --

00:02:47.345 --> 00:02:49.976
the face of someone who, against all odds,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.897
is on the verge of an epic win.

00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:55.237
Now, unfortunately this is more
of the face that we see

00:02:55.261 --> 00:02:58.032
in everyday life now as we try
to tackle urgent problems.

00:02:58.056 --> 00:03:00.555
This is what I call
the "I'm Not Good At Life" face.

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:02.079
This is actually me making it.

00:03:02.103 --> 00:03:03.356
Can you see? Yes. Good.

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.976
This is me making
the "I'm Not Good At Life" face.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.381
This is a piece of graffiti
in my old neighborhood

00:03:08.405 --> 00:03:10.660
in Berkeley, California,
where I did my PhD

00:03:10.684 --> 00:03:13.898
on why we're better in games
than we are in real life.

00:03:13.922 --> 00:03:16.201
And this is a problem
that a lot of gamers have.

00:03:16.225 --> 00:03:20.502
We feel that we are not as good
in reality as we are in games.

00:03:20.526 --> 00:03:23.976
I don't mean just good as in successful,
although that's part of it.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.845
We do achieve more in game worlds.

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:29.835
But I also mean good as in motivated
to do something that matters --

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:32.643
inspired to collaborate and to cooperate.

00:03:32.667 --> 00:03:34.119
And when we're in game worlds,

00:03:34.143 --> 00:03:37.200
I believe that many of us become
the best version of ourselves --

00:03:37.224 --> 00:03:39.342
the most likely to help
at a moment's notice,

00:03:39.366 --> 00:03:42.207
the most likely to stick
with a problem as long at it takes,

00:03:42.231 --> 00:03:44.317
to get up after failure and try again.

00:03:44.341 --> 00:03:47.976
And in real life, when we face failure,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.890
when we confront obstacles,
we often don't feel that way.

00:03:50.914 --> 00:03:53.756
We feel overcome, we feel overwhelmed,

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.520
we feel anxious, maybe depressed,
frustrated or cynical.

00:03:57.544 --> 00:04:00.100
We never have those feelings
when we're playing games,

00:04:00.124 --> 00:04:01.663
they just don't exist in games.

00:04:01.687 --> 00:04:04.744
So that's what I wanted to study
when I was a graduate student.

00:04:04.768 --> 00:04:07.240
What about games makes it impossible

00:04:07.264 --> 00:04:09.717
to feel that we can't achieve everything?

00:04:09.741 --> 00:04:12.145
How can we take those feelings from games

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:13.832
and apply them to real-world work?

00:04:13.856 --> 00:04:16.254
So I looked at games
like World of Warcraft,

00:04:16.278 --> 00:04:19.563
which is really the ideal collaborative
problem-solving environment.

00:04:19.587 --> 00:04:21.411
And I started to notice a few things

00:04:21.435 --> 00:04:24.592
that make epic wins
so possible in online worlds.

00:04:24.616 --> 00:04:27.901
The first thing is whenever you show up
in one of these online games,

00:04:27.925 --> 00:04:29.504
especially in World of Warcraft,

00:04:29.528 --> 00:04:31.822
there are lots and lots
of different characters

00:04:31.846 --> 00:04:36.100
who are willing to trust you
with a world-saving mission, right away.

00:04:36.124 --> 00:04:37.625
But not just any mission,

00:04:37.649 --> 00:04:41.465
it's a mission that is perfectly matched
with your current level in the game.

00:04:41.489 --> 00:04:43.195
Right? So you can do it.

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:45.664
They never give you a challenge
you can't achieve.

00:04:45.688 --> 00:04:48.063
But it is on the verge
of what you're capable of,

00:04:48.087 --> 00:04:49.331
so you have to try hard.

00:04:49.355 --> 00:04:52.676
But there's no unemployment
in World of Warcraft; no sitting around,

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:53.851
wringing your hands --

00:04:53.875 --> 00:04:56.694
there's always something
specific and important to be done.

00:04:56.718 --> 00:04:58.551
There are also tons of collaborators.

00:04:58.575 --> 00:05:00.963
Everywhere you go,
hundreds of thousands of people

00:05:00.987 --> 00:05:03.929
ready to work with you
to achieve your epic mission.

00:05:03.953 --> 00:05:06.579
That's not something we have
in real life that easily,

00:05:06.603 --> 00:05:09.592
this sense that at our fingertips
are tons of collaborators.

00:05:09.616 --> 00:05:13.107
And there's this epic story,
this inspiring story of why we're there,

00:05:13.131 --> 00:05:14.292
and what we're doing,

00:05:14.316 --> 00:05:16.194
and we get all this positive feedback.

00:05:16.218 --> 00:05:20.211
You guys have heard of leveling up,
+1 strength, +1 intelligence.

00:05:20.235 --> 00:05:22.917
We don't get that kind
of constant feedback in real life.

00:05:22.941 --> 00:05:24.182
When I get off this stage,

00:05:24.206 --> 00:05:29.088
I'm not going to have
+1 speaking, and +1 crazy idea,

00:05:29.112 --> 00:05:30.776
+20 crazy idea.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.818
I don't get that feedback in real life.

00:05:32.842 --> 00:05:37.690
Now, the problem with collaborative
online environments like World of Warcraft

00:05:37.714 --> 00:05:41.869
is that it's so satisfying to be
on the verge of an epic win all the time,

00:05:41.893 --> 00:05:44.468
we decide to spend all our time
in these game worlds.

00:05:44.492 --> 00:05:45.976
It's just better than reality.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.976
So, so far, collectively
all the World of Warcraft gamers

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.976
have spent 5.93 million years

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.976
solving the virtual problems of Azeroth.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.160
Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing.

00:05:58.517 --> 00:06:00.376
It might sound like it's a bad thing.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.724
But to put that in context:

00:06:01.748 --> 00:06:03.831
5.93 million years ago

00:06:03.855 --> 00:06:08.480
was when our earliest primate
human ancestors stood up.

00:06:08.504 --> 00:06:11.234
That was the first upright primate.

00:06:11.258 --> 00:06:14.362
So when we talk about how much time

00:06:14.386 --> 00:06:16.398
we're currently investing
in playing games,

00:06:16.422 --> 00:06:19.200
the only way it makes sense
to even think about it

00:06:19.224 --> 00:06:22.976
is to talk about time
at the magnitude of human evolution,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.976
which is an extraordinary thing.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.508
But it's also apt,

00:06:26.532 --> 00:06:29.690
because it turns out that by spending
all this time playing games,

00:06:29.714 --> 00:06:32.976
we're actually changing
what we are capable of as human beings.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.314
We're evolving to be a more
collaborative and hearty species.

00:06:36.663 --> 00:06:38.108
This is true. I believe this.

00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:41.290
So, consider this really
interesting statistic;

00:06:41.314 --> 00:06:44.798
it was recently published by a researcher
at Carnegie Mellon University:

00:06:44.822 --> 00:06:48.976
The average young person today
in a country with a strong gamer culture

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.654
will have spent 10,000 hours
playing online games

00:06:52.678 --> 00:06:53.924
by the age of 21.

00:06:54.439 --> 00:06:57.745
Now 10,000 hours is a really
interesting number for two reasons.

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:01.866
First of all, for children
in the United States,

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:06.874
10,080 hours is the exact amount
of time you will spend in school,

00:07:06.898 --> 00:07:09.000
from fifth grade
to high school graduation,

00:07:09.024 --> 00:07:10.547
if you have perfect attendance.

00:07:10.571 --> 00:07:11.572
(Laughter)

00:07:11.596 --> 00:07:15.181
So, we have an entire
parallel track of education going on,

00:07:15.205 --> 00:07:18.913
where young people are learning as much
about what it takes to be a good gamer

00:07:18.937 --> 00:07:21.417
as they're learning
about everything else in school.

00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:25.028
Some of you have probably read
Malcolm Gladwell's new book "Outliers,"

00:07:25.052 --> 00:07:27.394
so you would have heard
of his theory of success,

00:07:27.418 --> 00:07:29.517
the "10,000 hours" theory of success.

00:07:29.541 --> 00:07:31.976
It's based on this great
cognitive-science research

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.317
that says if we can master 10,000 hours

00:07:35.341 --> 00:07:38.714
of effortful study at anything
by the age of 21,

00:07:38.738 --> 00:07:40.237
we will be virtuosos at it.

00:07:40.261 --> 00:07:41.976
We will be as good at whatever we do

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.841
as the greatest people in the world.

00:07:43.865 --> 00:07:46.623
And so, now what we're looking at

00:07:46.647 --> 00:07:50.528
is an entire generation of young people
who are virtuoso gamers.

00:07:51.758 --> 00:07:53.976
So, the big question is,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.317
"What exactly are gamers
getting so good at?"

00:07:57.341 --> 00:07:59.126
Because if we could figure that out,

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:03.555
we would have a virtually unprecedented
human resource on our hands.

00:08:03.579 --> 00:08:05.842
This is how many people
we now have in the world

00:08:05.866 --> 00:08:08.753
who spend at least an hour
a day playing online games.

00:08:08.777 --> 00:08:10.873
These are our virtuoso gamers,

00:08:10.897 --> 00:08:14.729
500 million people who are
extraordinarily good at something.

00:08:15.658 --> 00:08:16.976
And in the next decade,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
we're going to have another billion gamers

00:08:19.024 --> 00:08:21.801
who are extraordinarily
good at whatever that is.

00:08:21.825 --> 00:08:23.976
If you don't know it already,
this is coming.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.976
The game industry is developing consoles

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.354
that are low-energy and that work
with the wireless phone networks

00:08:29.378 --> 00:08:31.204
instead of broadband Internet,

00:08:31.228 --> 00:08:32.976
so that gamers all over the world,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.824
particularly in India, China,
Brazil, can get online.

00:08:36.848 --> 00:08:39.474
They expect one billion more
gamers in the next decade.

00:08:39.498 --> 00:08:41.522
It will bring us up to 1.5 billion gamers.

00:08:41.957 --> 00:08:43.425
So I've started to think about

00:08:43.449 --> 00:08:45.665
what these games
are making us virtuosos at.

00:08:45.689 --> 00:08:47.640
Here are the four things I came up with.

00:08:47.664 --> 00:08:49.624
The first is urgent optimism.

00:08:49.648 --> 00:08:52.330
OK, think of this
as extreme self-motivation.

00:08:52.743 --> 00:08:55.791
Urgent optimism is the desire
to act immediately

00:08:55.815 --> 00:08:57.472
to tackle an obstacle,

00:08:57.496 --> 00:09:01.076
combined with the belief that we have
a reasonable hope of success.

00:09:01.743 --> 00:09:04.429
Gamers always believe
that an epic win is possible,

00:09:04.453 --> 00:09:07.158
and that it's always worth
trying, and trying now.

00:09:07.182 --> 00:09:08.432
Gamers don't sit around.

00:09:08.773 --> 00:09:12.829
Gamers are virtuosos
at weaving a tight social fabric.

00:09:12.853 --> 00:09:15.110
There's a lot of interesting
research that shows

00:09:15.134 --> 00:09:17.690
we like people better
after we play a game with them,

00:09:17.714 --> 00:09:19.523
even if they've beaten us badly.

00:09:19.547 --> 00:09:22.889
And the reason is, it takes a lot of trust
to play a game with someone.

00:09:22.913 --> 00:09:25.205
We trust that they will spend
their time with us,

00:09:25.229 --> 00:09:27.071
that they will play by the same rules,

00:09:27.095 --> 00:09:30.427
value the same goal,
stay with the game until it's over.

00:09:30.451 --> 00:09:32.019
And so, playing a game together

00:09:32.043 --> 00:09:34.976
actually builds up bonds
and trust and cooperation.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.825
And we actually build stronger
social relationships as a result.

00:09:39.238 --> 00:09:40.976
Blissful productivity. I love it.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.294
You know, there's a reason why
the average World of Warcraft gamer

00:09:44.318 --> 00:09:46.976
plays for 22 hours a week --
kind of a half-time job.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.602
It's because we know,
when we're playing a game,

00:09:49.626 --> 00:09:51.975
that we're actually happier working hard

00:09:51.999 --> 00:09:54.250
than we are relaxing, or hanging out.

00:09:54.274 --> 00:09:56.552
We know that we are
optimized as human beings,

00:09:56.576 --> 00:09:58.194
to do hard and meaningful work.

00:09:58.218 --> 00:10:01.425
And gamers are willing
to work hard all the time,

00:10:01.449 --> 00:10:03.050
if they're given the right work.

00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:05.266
Finally: epic meaning.

00:10:05.774 --> 00:10:09.511
Gamers love to be attached
to awe-inspiring missions

00:10:09.535 --> 00:10:13.547
to human planetary-scale stories.

00:10:13.571 --> 00:10:17.311
So, just one bit of trivia
that helps put that into perspective:

00:10:17.335 --> 00:10:20.976
So, you all know Wikipedia,
biggest wiki in the world.

00:10:21.357 --> 00:10:24.976
Second biggest wiki in the world,
with nearly 80,000 articles,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.976
is the World of Warcraft wiki.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.976
Five million people use it every month.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.659
They have compiled more information
about World of Warcraft on the Internet

00:10:32.683 --> 00:10:35.790
than any other topic covered
on any other wiki in the world.

00:10:35.814 --> 00:10:37.850
They are building an epic story.

00:10:37.874 --> 00:10:40.096
They are building an epic
knowledge resource

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.652
about the World of Warcraft.

00:10:41.676 --> 00:10:45.976
Okay, so these are four superpowers
that add up to one thing:

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.486
Gamers are super-empowered
hopeful individuals.

00:10:50.795 --> 00:10:54.000
These are people who believe
that they are individually capable

00:10:54.024 --> 00:10:55.574
of changing the world.

00:10:55.598 --> 00:10:57.233
And the only problem is,

00:10:57.257 --> 00:11:00.286
they believe that they are capable
of changing virtual worlds

00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:01.976
and not the real world.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.113
That's the problem
that I'm trying to solve.

00:11:04.613 --> 00:11:06.976
There's an economist
named Edward Castronova.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.170
His work is brilliant.

00:11:08.194 --> 00:11:11.096
He looks at why people are investing
so much time and energy

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.976
and money in online worlds.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.183
And he says,

00:11:14.207 --> 00:11:17.515
"We're witnessing what amounts to
no less than a mass exodus

00:11:17.539 --> 00:11:19.976
to virtual worlds and online
game environments."

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.189
And he's an economist, so he's rational.

00:11:22.213 --> 00:11:23.650
And he says --

00:11:23.674 --> 00:11:25.317
(Laughter)

00:11:25.341 --> 00:11:27.626
Not like me, I'm a game
designer; I'm exuberant.

00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:31.849
But he says that this makes perfect sense,

00:11:31.873 --> 00:11:34.297
because gamers can achieve
more in online worlds

00:11:34.321 --> 00:11:35.647
than they can in real life.

00:11:35.671 --> 00:11:38.132
They can have stronger
social relationships in games

00:11:38.156 --> 00:11:39.711
than they can have in real life;

00:11:39.735 --> 00:11:42.702
they get better feedback
and feel more rewarded in games

00:11:42.726 --> 00:11:43.976
than they do in real life.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
So he says, for now it makes perfect sense

00:11:46.024 --> 00:11:49.599
for gamers to spend more time
in virtual worlds than the real world.

00:11:49.623 --> 00:11:52.976
Now, I also agree
that that is rational, for now.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.976
But it is not, by any means,
an optimal situation.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.976
We have to start making
the real world work more like a game.

00:11:59.377 --> 00:12:02.359
I take my inspiration
from something that happened

00:12:02.383 --> 00:12:03.812
2,500 years ago.

00:12:04.392 --> 00:12:07.976
These are ancient dice,
made out of sheep's knuckles.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.976
Before we had awesome game controllers,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.813
we had sheep's knuckles.

00:12:11.837 --> 00:12:14.905
And these represent
the first game equipment

00:12:14.929 --> 00:12:16.795
designed by human beings,

00:12:16.819 --> 00:12:20.563
and if you're familiar with the work
of the ancient Greek historian Herodotus,

00:12:20.587 --> 00:12:22.096
you might know this history,

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:25.040
which is the history
of who invented games and why.

00:12:25.716 --> 00:12:28.560
Herodotus says that games,
particularly dice games,

00:12:28.584 --> 00:12:30.976
were invented in the kingdom of Lydia,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.809
during a time of famine.

00:12:32.833 --> 00:12:35.172
Apparently, there was such a severe famine

00:12:35.196 --> 00:12:38.976
that the king of Lydia decided
they had to do something crazy.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.096
People were suffering.
People were fighting.

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:44.976
It was an extreme situation,
they needed an extreme solution.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.976
So, according to Herodotus,
they invented dice games,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.976
and they set up a kingdom-wide policy:

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.582
On one day, everybody would eat,

00:12:53.606 --> 00:12:55.976
and on the next day,
everybody would play games.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.634
And they would be so immersed
in playing the dice games,

00:12:58.658 --> 00:13:00.102
because games are so engaging,

00:13:00.126 --> 00:13:03.338
and immerse us in such satisfying,
blissful productivity,

00:13:03.362 --> 00:13:06.076
they would ignore the fact
that they had no food to eat.

00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.386
And then on the next day,
they would play games;

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:10.286
and on the next day, they would eat.

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:11.976
And according to Herodotus,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.976
they passed 18 years this way,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.739
surviving through a famine,

00:13:15.763 --> 00:13:18.429
by eating on one day,
and playing games on the next.

00:13:18.453 --> 00:13:22.157
Now, this is exactly, I think,
how we're using games today.

00:13:22.726 --> 00:13:25.433
We're using games to escape
real-world suffering --

00:13:25.457 --> 00:13:27.048
we're using games to get away

00:13:27.072 --> 00:13:29.661
from everything that's broken
in the real environment,

00:13:29.685 --> 00:13:32.231
everything that's not satisfying
about real life,

00:13:32.255 --> 00:13:34.353
and we're getting what we need from games.

00:13:34.377 --> 00:13:35.976
But it doesn't have to end there.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.976
This is really exciting.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.976
According to Herodotus, after 18 years
the famine wasn't getting better,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.440
so the king decided they would
play one final dice game.

00:13:47.408 --> 00:13:49.781
They divided the entire kingdom in half.

00:13:50.169 --> 00:13:51.877
They played one dice game,

00:13:51.901 --> 00:13:55.320
and the winners of that game
got to go on an epic adventure.

00:13:55.344 --> 00:13:56.976
They would leave Lydia,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.975
and they would go out in search
of a new place to live,

00:13:59.999 --> 00:14:02.199
leaving behind just enough people

00:14:02.223 --> 00:14:04.516
to survive on the resources
that were available,

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:08.365
and hopefully to take their civilization
somewhere else where they could thrive.

00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:10.288
Now, this sounds crazy, right?

00:14:10.312 --> 00:14:14.730
But recently, DNA evidence
has shown that the Etruscans,

00:14:14.754 --> 00:14:16.516
who then led to the Roman Empire,

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:19.445
actually share the same DNA
as the ancient Lydians.

00:14:19.469 --> 00:14:21.976
And so, recently,
scientists have suggested

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.397
that Herodotus' crazy
story is actually true.

00:14:24.421 --> 00:14:27.390
And geologists have found
evidence of a global cooling

00:14:27.414 --> 00:14:31.150
that lasted for nearly 20 years,
that could have explained the famine.

00:14:31.174 --> 00:14:33.404
So this crazy story might be true.

00:14:33.428 --> 00:14:37.324
They might have actually saved
their culture by playing games,

00:14:37.348 --> 00:14:39.270
escaping to games for 18 years,

00:14:39.294 --> 00:14:40.746
and then been so inspired,

00:14:40.770 --> 00:14:43.452
and knew so much about
how to come together with games,

00:14:43.476 --> 00:14:46.213
that they actually saved
the entire civilization that way.

00:14:46.237 --> 00:14:47.402
Okay, we can do that.

00:14:47.426 --> 00:14:48.448
(Laughter)

00:14:48.472 --> 00:14:50.810
We've been playing Warcraft since 1994.

00:14:50.834 --> 00:14:54.505
That was the first real-time strategy
game from the World of Warcraft series.

00:14:54.529 --> 00:14:55.928
That was 16 years ago.

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:58.133
They played dice games for 18 years,

00:14:58.157 --> 00:15:00.403
we've been playing Warcraft for 16 years.

00:15:00.427 --> 00:15:03.585
I say we are ready for our own epic game.

00:15:03.609 --> 00:15:08.219
Now, they had half the civilization
go off in search of a new world,

00:15:08.243 --> 00:15:12.092
so that's where I get my 21 billion
hours a week of game-play from.

00:15:12.116 --> 00:15:13.976
Let's get half of us to agree

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.976
to spend an hour a day playing games,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.842
until we solve real-world problems.

00:15:17.866 --> 00:15:19.438
Now, I know you're asking,

00:15:19.462 --> 00:15:22.141
"How are we going to solve
real-world problems in games?"

00:15:22.165 --> 00:15:25.276
Well, that's what I've devoted
my work to over the past few years,

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:26.976
at the Institute for the Future.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.286
We have this banner
in our offices in Palo Alto,

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:33.135
and it expresses our view of how
we should try to relate to the future.

00:15:33.445 --> 00:15:35.706
We do not want to try
to predict the future.

00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:37.762
What we want to do is make the future.

00:15:37.786 --> 00:15:40.278
We want to imagine
the best-case scenario outcome,

00:15:40.302 --> 00:15:43.976
and then we want to empower people
to make that outcome a reality.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.976
We want to imagine epic wins,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.976
and then give people the means
to achieve the epic win.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.098
I'm just going to very briefly show you
three games that I've made

00:15:52.122 --> 00:15:55.178
that are an attempt to give people
the means to create epic wins

00:15:55.202 --> 00:15:56.535
in their own futures.

00:15:56.559 --> 00:15:57.976
This is World Without Oil.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.691
We made this game in 2007.

00:15:59.715 --> 00:16:01.073
This is an online game

00:16:01.097 --> 00:16:03.817
in which you try to survive
an oil shortage.

00:16:04.507 --> 00:16:06.102
The oil shortage is fictional,

00:16:06.126 --> 00:16:08.976
but we put enough online content out there

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.680
for you to believe that it's real,

00:16:10.704 --> 00:16:13.590
and to live your real life
as if we've run out of oil.

00:16:13.614 --> 00:16:15.050
So when you come to the game,

00:16:15.074 --> 00:16:17.003
you sign up, tell us where you live,

00:16:17.027 --> 00:16:19.367
and then we give you
real-time news videos,

00:16:19.391 --> 00:16:22.511
data feeds that show you
exactly how much oil costs,

00:16:22.535 --> 00:16:25.264
what's not available, how food
supply is being affected,

00:16:25.288 --> 00:16:27.122
how transportation is being affected,

00:16:27.146 --> 00:16:29.217
if schools are closed, if there's rioting,

00:16:29.241 --> 00:16:32.090
and you have to figure out
how you would live your real life

00:16:32.114 --> 00:16:33.353
as if this were true.

00:16:33.377 --> 00:16:35.176
And then we ask you to blog about it,

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.976
to post videos, to post photos.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.400
We piloted this game
with 1,700 players in 2007,

00:16:40.424 --> 00:16:42.757
and we've tracked them
for the three years since.

00:16:42.781 --> 00:16:45.858
And I can tell you that this
is a transformative experience.

00:16:45.882 --> 00:16:47.765
Nobody wants to change how they live,

00:16:47.789 --> 00:16:51.191
just because it's good for the world,
or because we're supposed to.

00:16:51.518 --> 00:16:53.976
But if you immerse them
in an epic adventure

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:55.976
and tell them, "We've run out of oil.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.265
This is an amazing story
and adventure for you to go on.

00:16:59.289 --> 00:17:01.976
Challenge yourself to see
how you would survive,"

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.048
most of our players
have kept up the habits

00:17:04.072 --> 00:17:05.868
that they learned in this game.

00:17:05.892 --> 00:17:07.976
So for the next world-saving game,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.976
we decided to aim higher --
bigger problem than just peak oil.

00:17:11.495 --> 00:17:14.877
We did a game called Superstruct
at the Institute for the Future.

00:17:14.901 --> 00:17:17.976
And the premise was,
a supercomputer has calculated

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.976
that humans have only 23 years
left on the planet.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.549
This supercomputer was called

00:17:22.573 --> 00:17:24.976
the Global Extinction
Awareness System, of course.

00:17:25.334 --> 00:17:26.976
We asked people to come online --

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.099
almost like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie.

00:17:29.123 --> 00:17:31.976
You know Jerry Bruckheimer
movies, you form a dream team --

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.751
you've got the astronaut,
the scientist, the ex-convict,

00:17:34.775 --> 00:17:37.212
and they all have something
to do to save the world.

00:17:37.236 --> 00:17:38.243
(Laughter)

00:17:38.267 --> 00:17:41.655
But in our game, instead of just having
five people on the dream team,

00:17:41.679 --> 00:17:43.608
we said, "Everybody's on the dream team,

00:17:43.632 --> 00:17:45.976
and it's your job to invent
the future of energy,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.976
the future of food, the future of health,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.048
the future of security and the future
of the social safety net."

00:17:51.072 --> 00:17:53.661
We had 8,000 people
play that game for eight weeks.

00:17:53.685 --> 00:17:56.733
They came up with 500
insanely creative solutions

00:17:56.757 --> 00:17:59.296
that you can go online,
Google "Superstruct," and see.

00:17:59.611 --> 00:18:00.976
So, finally, the last game,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.456
we're launching it March 3rd.

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.914
This is a game done
with the World Bank Institute.

00:18:04.938 --> 00:18:06.142
If you complete the game,

00:18:06.166 --> 00:18:08.976
you will be certified
by the World Bank Institute

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.698
as a Social Innovator, class of 2010.

00:18:11.722 --> 00:18:14.976
Working with universities
all over sub-Saharan Africa,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.976
and we are inviting them
to learn social innovation skills.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.976
We've got a graphic novel,
we've got leveling up

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.976
in skills like local insight,
knowledge networking,

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.001
sustainability,
vision and resourcefulness.

00:18:26.485 --> 00:18:28.072
I would like to invite all of you

00:18:28.096 --> 00:18:30.231
to please share this game
with young people,

00:18:30.255 --> 00:18:32.976
anywhere in the world,
particularly in developing areas,

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.198
who might benefit from coming together

00:18:35.222 --> 00:18:38.931
to try to start to imagine their own
social enterprises to save the world.

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:41.163
So, I'm going to wrap up now.

00:18:41.766 --> 00:18:42.976
I want to ask a question.

00:18:43.536 --> 00:18:45.020
What do you think happens next?

00:18:45.361 --> 00:18:48.029
We've got all these amazing gamers,
we've got these games

00:18:48.053 --> 00:18:50.165
that are kind of pilots
of what we might do,

00:18:50.189 --> 00:18:52.395
but none of them
have saved the real world yet.

00:18:52.419 --> 00:18:56.768
Well I hope you will agree with me
that gamers are a human resource

00:18:56.792 --> 00:18:58.976
that we can use to do real-world work,

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.219
that games are a powerful
platform for change.

00:19:01.577 --> 00:19:03.569
We have all these amazing superpowers:

00:19:03.593 --> 00:19:06.976
blissful productivity, the ability
to weave a tight social fabric,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.976
this feeling of urgent optimism
and the desire for epic meaning.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.509
I really hope that we can come together
to play games that matter,

00:19:14.533 --> 00:19:16.759
to survive on this planet
for another century.

00:19:16.783 --> 00:19:20.435
That's my hope, that you will join me
in making and playing games like this.

00:19:20.459 --> 00:19:24.259
When I look forward to the next decade,
I know two things for sure:

00:19:24.283 --> 00:19:26.976
that we can make
any future we can imagine,

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.110
and we can play any games
we want, so I say:

00:19:30.134 --> 00:19:31.850
Let the world-changing games begin.

00:19:31.874 --> 00:19:33.032
Thank you.

00:19:33.056 --> 00:19:37.230
(Applause)
