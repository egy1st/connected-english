WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So, I was just asked to go and shoot this film called "Elizabeth."

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And we're all talking about this great English icon and saying,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
"She's a fantastic woman, she does everything.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
How are we going to introduce her?"

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So we went around the table with the studio and the producers and the writer,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and they came to me and said, "Shekhar, what do you think?"

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And I said, "I think she's dancing."

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And I could see everybody looked at me,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
somebody said, "Bollywood."

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The other said, "How much did we hire him for?"

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And the third said, "Let's find another director."

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I thought I had better change.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So we had a lot of discussion on how to introduce Elizabeth,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and I said, "OK, maybe I am too Bollywood.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Maybe Elizabeth, this great icon, dancing?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
What are you talking about?"

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So I rethought the whole thing,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and then we all came to a consensus.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And here was the introduction of this

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
great British icon called "Elizabeth."

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Leicester: May I join you, my lady?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Elizabeth: If it please you, sir.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
(Music)

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Shekhar Kapur: So she was dancing.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
So how many people who saw the film did not get

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
that here was a woman in love,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
that she was completely innocent

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and saw great joy in her life, and she was youthful?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And how many of you did not get that?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
That's the power of visual storytelling,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
that's the power of dance, that's the power of music:

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
the power of not knowing.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
When I go out to direct a film,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
every day we prepare too much, we think too much.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Knowledge becomes a weight upon wisdom.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
You know, simple words lost

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
in the quicksand of experience.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
So I come up, and I say,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
"What am I going to do today?" I'm not going to do what I planned to do,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
and I put myself into absolute panic.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
It's my one way of getting rid of my mind,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
getting rid of this mind that says,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
"Hey, you know what you're doing. You know exactly what you're doing.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
You're a director, you've done it for years."

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
So I've got to get there

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and be in complete panic.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
It's a symbolic gesture. I tear up the script,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I go and I panic myself, I get scared.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I'm doing it right now; you can watch me. I'm getting nervous,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I don't know what to say, I don't know what I'm doing, I don't want to go there.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And as I go there, of course, my A.D. says,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
"You know what you're going to do, sir." I say, "Of course I do."

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
And the studio executives, they would say,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
"Hey, look at Shekhar. He's so prepared."

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And inside I've just been listening to Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
because he's chaotic.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
I'm allowing myself to go into chaos

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
because out of chaos, I'm hoping some moments of truth will come.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
All preparation is preparation.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
I don't even know if it's honest.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
I don't even know if it's truthful.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
The truth of it all comes on the moment, organically,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
and if you get five great moments

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
of great, organic stuff

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
in your storytelling, in your film,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
your film, audiences will get it.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
So I'm looking for those moments, and I'm standing there

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
and saying, "I don't know what to say."

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
So, ultimately, everybody's looking at you,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
200 people at seven in the morning

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
who got there at quarter to seven, and you arrived at seven,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and everybody's saying,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
"Hey. What's the first thing? What's going to happen?"

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And you put yourself into a state of panic

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
where you don't know, and so you don't know.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And so, because you don't know,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
you're praying to the universe because you're praying to the universe

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
that something -- I'm going to try and access the universe

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
the way Einstein -- say a prayer --

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
accessed his equations,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
the same source. I'm looking for the same source

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
because creativity comes from absolutely the same source

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
that you meditate somewhere outside yourself,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
outside the universe.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
You're looking for something that comes and hits you.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Until that hits you, you're not going to do the first shot.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
So what do you do?

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
So Cate says, "Shekhar, what do you want me to do?"

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
And I say, "Cate, what do you want to do?" (Laughter)

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
"You're a great actor, and I like to give to my actors --

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
why don't you show me what you want to do?"

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
(Laughter)

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
What am I doing? I'm trying to buy time.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
I'm trying to buy time.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
So the first thing about storytelling that I learned,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
and I follow all the time is: Panic.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Panic is the great access of creativity

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
because that's the only way to get rid of your mind.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Get rid of your mind.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Get out of it, get it out.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And let's go to the universe because

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
there's something out there that is more

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
truthful than your mind,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
that is more truthful than your universe.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
[unclear], you said that yesterday. I'm just repeating it

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
because that's what I follow constantly

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
to find the shunyata somewhere, the emptiness.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Out of the emptiness comes a moment of creativity.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
So that's what I do.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
When I was a kid -- I was about eight years old.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
You remember how India was. There was no pollution.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
In Delhi, we used to live -- we used to call it a chhat or the khota.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Khota's now become a bad word. It means their terrace --

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
and we used to sleep out at night.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
At school I was being just taught about physics,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
and I was told that

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
if there is something that exists,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
then it is measurable.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
If it is not measurable,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
it does not exist.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
And at night I would lie out, looking at the unpolluted sky,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
as Delhi used to be at that time when I was a kid,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
and I used to stare at the universe and say,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
"How far does this universe go?"

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
My father was a doctor.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
And I would think, "Daddy, how far does the universe go?"

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
And he said, "Son, it goes on forever."

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
So I said, "Please measure forever

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
because in school they're teaching me

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
that if I cannot measure it, it does not exist.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
It doesn't come into my frame of reference."

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
So, how far does eternity go?

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
What does forever mean?

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
And I would lie there crying at night

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
because my imagination could not touch creativity.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
So what did I do?

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
At that time, at the tender age of seven,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
I created a story.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
What was my story?

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And I don't know why, but I remember the story.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
There was a woodcutter

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
who's about to take his ax and chop a piece of wood,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
and the whole galaxy is one atom of that ax.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
And when that ax hits that piece of wood,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
that's when everything will destroy

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
and the Big Bang will happen again.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
But all before that there was a woodcutter.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
And then when I would run out of that story,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
I would imagine that woodcutter's universe

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
is one atom in the ax of another woodcutter.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
So every time, I could tell my story again and again

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
and get over this problem,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
and so I got over the problem.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
How did I do it? Tell a story.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
So what is a story?

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
A story is our -- all of us --

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
we are the stories we tell ourselves.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
In this universe, and this existence,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
where we live with this duality

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
of whether we exist or not

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
and who are we,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
the stories we tell ourselves are the stories

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
that define the potentialities

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
of our existence.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
We are the stories we tell ourselves.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
So that's as wide as we look at stories.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
A story is the relationship

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
that you develop between who you are,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
or who you potentially are,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
and the infinite world, and that's our mythology.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
We tell our stories,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
and a person without a story does not exist.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
So Einstein told a story

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
and followed his stories and came up with theories

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
and came up with theories and then came up with his equations.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Alexander had a story that his mother used to tell him,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
and he went out to conquer the world.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
We all, everybody, has a story that they follow.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
We tell ourselves stories.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
So, I will go further, and I say,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
"I tell a story, and therefore I exist."

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
I exist because there are stories,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
and if there are no stories, we don't exist.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
We create stories to define our existence.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
If we do not create the stories,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
we probably go mad.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
I don't know; I'm not sure, but that's what I've done all the time.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Now, a film.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
A film tells a story.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
I often wonder when I make a film -- I'm thinking of making a film of the Buddha --

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
and I often wonder: If Buddha had all the elements

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
that are given to a director --

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
if he had music, if he had visuals, if he had a video camera --

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
would we get Buddhism better?

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
But that puts some kind of burden on me.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
I have to tell a story

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
in a much more elaborate way,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
but I have the potential.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
It's called subtext.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
When I first went to Hollywood, they said --

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
I used to talk about subtext, and my agent came to me,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
"Would you kindly not talk about subtext?"

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
And I said, "Why?" He said, "Because nobody is going to give you a film

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
if you talk about subtext.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Just talk about plot

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
and say how wonderful you'll shoot the film,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
what the visuals will be."

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
So when I look at a film,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
here's what we look for:

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
We look for a story on the plot level,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
then we look for a story

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
on the psychological level,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
then we look for a story on the political level,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
then we look at a story

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
on a mythological level.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
And I look for stories on each level.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Now, it is not necessary

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
that these stories agree with each other.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
What is wonderful is,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
at many times, the stories will contradict with each other.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
So when I work with Rahman who's a great musician,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000
I often tell him, "Don't follow what the script already says.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Find that which is not.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Find the truth for yourself,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
and when you find the truth for yourself,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
there will be a truth in it, but it may contradict the plot,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
but don't worry about it."

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
So, the sequel to "Elizabeth," "Golden Age."

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
When I made the sequel to "Elizabeth," here was a story that

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
the writer was telling:

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
A woman who was threatened

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
by Philip II

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
and was going to war,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
and was going to war, fell in love with Walter Raleigh.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Because she fell in love with Walter Raleigh,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
she was giving up the reasons she was a queen,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
and then Walter Raleigh

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
fell in love with her lady in waiting,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
and she had to decide whether she was a queen going to war

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
or she wanted...

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Here's the story I was telling:

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
The gods up there,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
there were two people.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
There was Philip II, who was divine

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
because he was always praying,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
and there was Elizabeth, who was divine,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
but not quite divine because she thought she was divine,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
but the blood of being mortal flowed in her.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
But the divine one was unjust,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
so the gods said,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
"OK, what we need to do is

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
help the just one."

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
And so they helped the just one.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And what they did was, they sent Walter Raleigh down

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
to physically separate her mortal self

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
from her spirit self.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
And the mortal self was the girl

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
that Walter Raleigh was sent,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
and gradually he separated her

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
so she was free to be divine.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
And the two divine people fought,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
and the gods were on the side of divinity.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Of course, all the British press got really upset.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
They said, "We won the Armada."

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
But I said, "But the storm won the Armada.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
The gods sent the storm."

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
So what was I doing?

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
I was trying to find a mythic reason

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
to make the film.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Of course, when I asked Cate Blanchett, I said, "What's the film about?"

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
She said, "The film's about a woman

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
coming to terms with growing older."

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Psychological.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
The writer said "It's about history, plot."

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
I said "It's about mythology,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
the gods."

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
So let me show you a film --

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
a piece from that film --

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
and how a camera also --

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
so this is a scene, where in my mind,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
she was at the depths of mortality.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
She was discovering what mortality actually means,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
and if she is at the depths of mortality,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
what really happens.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
And she's recognizing the dangers of mortality

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
and why she should break away from mortality.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Remember, in the film, to me,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
both her and her lady in waiting

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
were parts of the same body,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
one the mortal self

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
and one the spirit self.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
So can we have that second?

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
(Music)

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Elizabeth: Bess?

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Bess?

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Bess Throckmorton?

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Bess: Here, my lady.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Elizabeth: Tell me, is it true?

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Are you with child?

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Are you with child?

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Bess: Yes, my lady.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Elizabeth: Traitorous.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
You dare to keep secrets from me?

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
You ask my permission before you rut,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
before you breed.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
My bitches wear my collars.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Do you hear me? Do you hear me?

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Walsingham: Majesty. Please, dignity. Mercy.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Elizabeth: This is no time for mercy, Walsingham.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
You go to your traitor brother and leave me to my business.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
Is it his?

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Tell me. Say it. Is the child his? Is it his?

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Bess: Yes.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
My lady,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
it is my husband's child.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Elizabeth: Bitch! (Cries)

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Raleigh: Majesty.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
This is not the queen I love and serve.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Elizabeth: This man has seduced a ward of the queen,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
and she has married without royal consent.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
These offenses are punishable by law. Arrest him.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Go.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
You no longer have the queen's protection.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Bess: As you wish, Majesty.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Elizabeth: Get out! Get out! Get out!

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Get out.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
(Music)

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Shekhar Kapur: So, what am I trying to do here?

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
Elizabeth has realized,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
and she's coming face-to-face

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
with her own sense of jealousy,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
her own sense of mortality.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
What am I doing with the architecture?

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
The architecture is telling a story.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
The architecture is telling a story

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
about how, even though she's the most powerful woman

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
in the world at that time,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
there is the other, the architecture's bigger.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
The stone is bigger than her because stone is an organic.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
It'll survive her.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
So it's telling you, to me, stone is part of her destiny.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Not only that, why is the camera looking down?

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
The camera's looking down at her because she's in the well.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
She's in the absolute well

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
of her own sense of being mortal.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
That's where she has to pull herself out

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
from the depths of mortality,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
come in, release her spirit.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
And that's the moment where, in my mind,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
both Elizabeth and Bess are the same person.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
But that's the moment

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
she's surgically removing herself from that.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
So the film is operating on

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
many many levels in that scene.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
And how we tell stories

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
visually, with music, with actors,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
and at each level it's a different sense

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
and sometimes contradictory to each other.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000
So how do I start all this?

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
What's the process of telling a story?

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
About ten years ago,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
I heard this little thing from a politician,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
not a politician that was very well respected in India.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
And he said that these people in the cities,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
in one flush, expend as much water

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
as you people in the rural areas

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
don't get for your family for two days.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
That struck a chord, and I said, "That's true."

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
I went to see a friend of mine,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
and he made me wait

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
in his apartment in Malabar Hill

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
on the twentieth floor,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
which is a really, really upmarket area in Mumbai.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
And he was having a shower for 20 minutes.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
I got bored and left, and as I drove out,

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
I drove past the slums of Bombay,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
as you always do,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
and I saw lines and lines in the hot midday sun

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
of women and children with buckets

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
waiting for a tanker

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
to come and give them water.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
And an idea started to develop.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
So how does that become a story?

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
I suddenly realized that we are heading towards disaster.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
So my next film is called "Paani"

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
which means water.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
And now, out of the mythology of that,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
I'm starting to create a world.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
What kind of world do I create,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
and where does the idea, the design of that come?

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
So, in my mind, in the future,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
they started to build flyovers.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
You understand flyovers? Yeah?

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
They started to build flyovers

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
to get from A to B faster,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
but they effectively went from one area of relative wealth

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
to another area of relative wealth.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
And then what they did was

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
they created a city above the flyovers.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
And the rich people moved to the upper city

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
and left the poorer people in the lower cities,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
about 10 to 12 percent of the people

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
have moved to the upper city.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Now, where does this upper city and lower city come?

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
There's a mythology in India about --

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
where they say, and I'll say it in Hindi,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:19.000
[Hindi]

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Right. What does that mean?

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
It says that the rich are always sitting on the shoulders

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
and survive on the shoulders of the poor.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
So, from that mythology, the upper city and lower city come.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
So the design has a story.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
And now, what happens is that the people of the upper city,

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
they suck up all the water.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Remember the word I said, suck up.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
They suck up all the water, keep to themselves,

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
and they drip feed the lower city.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
And if there's any revolution, they cut off the water.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
And, because democracy still exists,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
there's a democratic way in which you say

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
"Well, if you give us what [we want], we'll give you water."

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
So, okay my time is up.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
But I can go on about telling you

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000
how we evolve stories,

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000
and how stories effectively are who we are

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
and how these get translated into the particular discipline

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
that I am in, which is film.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
But ultimately, what is a story? It's a contradiction.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
Everything's a contradiction.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
The universe is a contradiction.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
And all of us are constantly looking for harmony.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
When you get up, the night and day is a contradiction.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
But you get up at 4 a.m.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
That first blush of blue is where the night and day

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
are trying to find harmony with each other.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
Harmony is the notes that Mozart didn't give you,

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
but somehow the contradiction of his notes suggest that.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000
All contradictions of his notes suggest the harmony.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
It's the effect of looking for harmony

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
in the contradiction that exists in a poet's mind,

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000
a contradiction that exists in a storyteller's mind.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000
In a storyteller's mind, it's a contradiction of moralities.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
In a poet's mind, it's a conflict of words,

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000
in the universe's mind, between day and night.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
In the mind of a man and a woman,

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
we're looking constantly at

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
the contradiction between male and female,

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
we're looking for harmony within each other.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000
The whole idea of contradiction,

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000
but the acceptance of contradiction

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
is the telling of a story, not the resolution.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
The problem with a lot of the storytelling in Hollywood

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
and many films, and as [unclear] was saying in his,

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
that we try to resolve the contradiction.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Harmony is not resolution.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Harmony is the suggestion of a thing

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
that is much larger than resolution.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
Harmony is the suggestion of something

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
that is embracing and universal

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
and of eternity and of the moment.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Resolution is something that is far more limited.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000
It is finite; harmony is infinite.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000
So that storytelling, like all other contradictions in the universe,

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:39.000
is looking for harmony and infinity

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
in moral resolutions, resolving one, but letting another go,

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000
letting another go and creating a question that is really important.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
Thank you very much.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000
(Applause)
