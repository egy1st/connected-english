00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Illegal wildlife trade in Brazil

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
is one of the major threats against our fauna,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
especially birds,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and mainly to supply the pet market

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
with thousands of animals taken from nature every month,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and transported far from their origins,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
to be sold mainly in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It is estimated that

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
all kinds of illegal wildlife trade in Brazil

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
withdraw from nature

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
almost 38 million animals every year,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
a business worth almost two billion dollars.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The police intercepts

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
these huge cargos with live animals,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
intended to supply the pet market,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
or they seize the animals directly from the people's houses,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and this is how we end up, every month,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
with thousands of seized animals.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And for us to understand what happens with them,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
we're going to follow Brad.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
In the eyes of many people,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
after the animals are seized,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
they say, "Yay, justice has been served.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
The good guys arrived,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
took the cute, mistreated animals

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
from the hands of the evil traffickers,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and everyone lived happily ever after."

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
But did they? Actually, no,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and this is where many of our problems begin.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Because we have to figure out

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
what to do with all these animals.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
In Brazil, they are usually first sent

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
to governmental triage facilities,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
in which most of the cases,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
the conditions are as bad as

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
with the traffickers.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
In 2002, these centers received

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
45,000 animals,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
of which 37,000 were birds.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And the police estimates that we seize

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
only five percent of what's being trafficked.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Some lucky ones -- and among them, Brad --

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
go to serious rehabilitation centers after that.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And in these places they are cared for.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
They train their flying,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
they learn how to recognize the food they will find in nature,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and they are able to socialize

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
with others from the same species.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
(Laughter)

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
But then what?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
The Brazil Ornithological Society --

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
so now we're talking only birds --

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
claims that we have too little knowledge

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
about the species in nature.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Therefore, it would be too risky

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
to release these animals,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
both for the released and for the natural populations.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
They also claim that we spend too many resources

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
in their rehabilitation.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Following this argument,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
they suggest that all the birds

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
seized from non-threatened species

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
should be euthanized.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
However, this would mean having killed

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
26,267 birds,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
only in the state of São Paulo, only in 2006.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
But, some researchers, myself included --

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
some NGOs and some people from the Brazilian government --

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
believe there is an alternative.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
We think that if and when the animals meet

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
certain criteria concerning their health,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
behavior, inferred origin

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
and whatever we know about the natural populations,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
then technically responsible releases are possible,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
both for the well-being of the individual,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and for the conservation of the species and their ecosystems,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
because we will be returning genes for these populations --

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
which could be important for them

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
in facing environmental challenges --

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
and also we could be returning

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000
potential seed dispersers, predators, preys, etc.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
All of these were released by us.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
On the top, the turtles are just enjoying freedom.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
(Laughter)

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
On the middle,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
this guy nested a couple of weeks after the release.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And on the bottom, my personal favorite,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
the little male over there,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
four hours after his release

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
he was together with a wild female.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
So, this is not new, people have been

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
doing this around the world.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
But it's still a big issue in Brazil.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
We believe we have performed

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
responsible releases.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
We've registered released animals mating in nature

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
and having chicks.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.000
So, these genes are indeed going back to the populations.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
However this is still a minority

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
for the very lack of knowledge.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
So, I say, "Let's study more, let's shed light on this issue,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
let's do whatever we can."

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
I'm devoting my career to that.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And I'm here to urge each and every one of you

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
to do whatever is in your reach:

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Talk to your neighbor, teach your children,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
make sure your pet is from a legal breeder.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
We need to act, and act now,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
before these ones are the only ones left.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Thank you very much.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
(Applause)
