00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So, basically we have public leaders,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
public officials who are out of control;

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
they are writing bills that are unintelligible,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and out of these bills are going to come

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
maybe 40,000 pages of regulations, total complexity,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
which has a dramatically negative impact on our life.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
If you're a veteran coming back from Iraq or Vietnam

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
you face a blizzard of paperwork to get your benefits;

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
if you're trying to get a small business loan,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
you face a blizzard of paperwork.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
What are we going to do about it? I define simplicity

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
as a means to achieving clarity,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
transparency and empathy,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
building humanity into communications.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I've been simplifying things for 30 years.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I come out of the advertising and design business.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
My focus is understanding you people,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and how you interact with the government

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
to get your benefits,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
how you interact with corporations to decide whom you're going to do business with,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and how you view brands.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So, very quickly, when President Obama said,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
"I don't see why we can't

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
have a one-page, plain English consumer credit agreement."

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So, I locked myself in a room,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
figured out the content,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
organized the document, and wrote it in plain English.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I've had this checked by the two top

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
consumer credit lawyers in the country.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
This is a real thing.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Now, I went one step further and said,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
"Why do we have to stick with the stodgy lawyers

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and just have a paper document? Let's go online."

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And many people

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
might need help in computation.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Working with the Harvard Business School,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
you'll see this example when you talk about minimum payment:

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
If you spent 62 dollars for a meal,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
the longer you take to pay out that loan,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
you see, over a period of time using the minimum payment

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
it's 99 dollars and 17 cents.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
How about that? Do you think your bank is going to show that to people?

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
But it's going to work. It's more effective

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
than just computational aids.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And what about terms like

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
"over the limit"?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Perhaps a stealth thing.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Define it in context. Tell people what it means.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
When you put it in plain English,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
you almost force the institution

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
to give the people a way, a default out of that,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and not put themselves at risk.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Plain English is about

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
changing the content.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And one of the things I'm most proud of

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
is this agreement for IBM.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
It's a grid, it's a calendar.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
At such and such a date, IBM has responsibilities,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
you have responsibilities.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Received very favorably by business.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
And there is some good news to report today.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Each year, one in 10 taxpayers

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
receives a notice from the IRS.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
There are 200 million letters that go out.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Running through this typical letter that they had,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
I ran it through my simplicity lab,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
it's pretty unintelligible.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
All the parts of the document in red are not intelligible.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
We looked at doing over 1,000 letters that cover

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
70 percent of their transactions in plain English.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
They have been tested in the laboratory.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
When I run it through my lab,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
this heat-mapping shows everything

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
is intelligible.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
And the IRS has introduced the program.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
(Applause)

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
There are a couple of things going on right now

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
that I want to bring to your attention.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
There is a lot of discussion now

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
about a consumer financial protection agency,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
how to mandate simplicity.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
We see all this complexity.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
It's incumbent upon us,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
and this organization, I believe,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
to make clarity, transparency

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
and empathy a national priority.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
There is no way that we should allow government

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
to communicate the way they communicate.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
There is no way we should do business

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
with companies that have agreements

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
with stealth provisions and that are unintelligible.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
So, how are we going to change the world?

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Make clarity, transparency and simplicity a national priority.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
I thank you.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000
(Applause)
