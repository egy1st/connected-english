00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I want to talk about 4.6 billion years of history

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
in 18 minutes.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
That's 300 million years per minute.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Let's start with the first photograph NASA obtained

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
of planet Mars.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
This is fly-by, Mariner IV.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It was taken in 1965.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
When this picture appeared,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
that well-known scientific journal,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The New York Times, wrote in its editorial,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
"Mars is uninteresting.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It's a dead world. NASA should not spend

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
any time or effort studying Mars anymore."

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Fortunately, our leaders in Washington

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
at NASA headquarters knew better

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and we began a very extensive study

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
of the red planet.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
One of the key questions in all of science,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
"Is there life outside of Earth?"

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I believe that Mars is the most likely target

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
for life outside the Earth.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I'm going to show you in a few minutes

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
some amazing measurements that suggest

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
there may be life on Mars.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
But let me start with a Viking photograph.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
This is a composite taken by Viking in 1976.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Viking was developed and managed at the

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
NASA Langley Research Center.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
We sent two orbiters and two landers in the summer of 1976.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
We had four spacecraft, two around Mars,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
two on the surface --

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
an amazing accomplishment.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
This is the first photograph taken from

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
the surface of any planet.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
This is a Viking Lander photograph

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
of the surface of Mars.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And yes, the red planet is red.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Mars is half the size of the Earth,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
but because two-thirds of the Earth is covered by water,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
the land area on Mars

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
is comparable to the land area on Earth.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
So, Mars is a pretty big place even though it's half the size.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
We have obtained topographic measurements

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
of the surface of Mars. We understand

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
the elevation differences.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
We know a lot about Mars.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Mars has the largest volcano in the solar system,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Olympus Mons.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Mars has the Grand Canyon

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
of the solar system, Valles Marineris.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Very, very interesting planet.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Mars has the largest

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
impact crater in the solar system,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Hellas Basin.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
This is 2,000 miles across.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
If you happened to be on Mars

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
when this impactor hit,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
it was a really bad day on Mars.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
(Laughter)

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
This is Olympus Mons.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
This is bigger than the state of Arizona.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Volcanoes are important, because volcanoes

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
produce atmospheres and they produce oceans.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
We're looking at Valles Marineris,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
the largest canyon in the solar system,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
superimposed on a map of the United States,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
3,000 miles across.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
One of the most intriguing features about Mars,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
the National Academy of Science says

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
one of the 10 major mysteries of the space age,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
is why certain areas of Mars

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
are so highly magnetized.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
We call this crustal magnetism.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
There are regions on Mars, where, for some reason --

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
we don't understand why at this point --

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
the surface is very, very highly magnetized.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Is there water on Mars?

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
The answer is no, there is no liquid water

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
on the surface of Mars today.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
But there is intriguing evidence

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
that suggests that the early history of Mars

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
there may have been rivers

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
and fast flowing water.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Today Mars is very very dry.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
We believe there's some water in the polar caps,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
there are polar caps of North Pole and South Pole.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Here are some recent images.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
This is from Spirit and Opportunity.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
These images that show at one time,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
there was very fast flowing water on the surface of Mars.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Why is water important? Water is important

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
because if you want life you have to have water.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Water is the key ingredient

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
in the evolution, the origin of life on a planet.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Here is some picture of Antarctica

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
and a picture of Olympus Mons,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
very similar features, glaciers.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
So, this is frozen water.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
This is ice water on Mars.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
This is my favorite picture. This was just taken a few weeks ago.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
It has not been seen publicly.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
This is European space agency

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Mars Express, image of a crater on Mars

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
and in the middle of the crater

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
we have liquid water, we have ice.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Very intriguing photograph.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
We now believe that in the early history of Mars,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
which is 4.6 billion years ago,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
4.6 billion years ago, Mars was very Earth-like.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Mars had rivers, Mars had lakes,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
but more important Mars had planetary-scale oceans.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
We believe that the oceans were in the northern hemisphere,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
and this area in blue,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
which shows a depression of about four miles,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
was the ancient ocean area

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
on the surface of Mars.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Where did the ocean's worth of water on Mars go?

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Well, we have an idea.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
This is a measurement we obtained a few years ago

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
from a Mars-orbiting satellite called Odyssey.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Sub-surface water on Mars,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
frozen in the form of ice.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And this shows the percent. If it's a blueish color,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
it means 16 percent by weight.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Sixteen percent, by weight, of the interior

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
contains frozen water, or ice.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
So, there is a lot of water below the surface.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000
The most intriguing and puzzling measurement,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
in my opinion, we've obtained of Mars,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
was released earlier this year

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
in the magazine Science.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And what we're looking at is the presence of the gas methane,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
CH4, in the atmosphere of Mars.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
And you can see there are three distinct regions of methane.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Why is methane important?

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Because on Earth, almost all --

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
99.9 percent -- of the methane

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
is produced by living systems,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
not little green men, but microscopic life

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
below the surface or at the surface.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
We now have evidence

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
that methane is in the atmosphere of Mars,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
a gas that, on Earth,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
is biogenic in origin,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
produced by living systems.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
These are the three plumes: A, B1, B2.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
And this is the terrain it appears over,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
and we know from geological studies

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
that these regions are the oldest regions on Mars.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
In fact, the Earth and Mars

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
are both 4.6 billion years old.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
The oldest rock on Earth is only 3.6 billion.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
The reason there is a billion-year gap

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
in our geological understanding

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
is because of plate tectonics,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
The crust of the Earth has been recycled.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
We have no geological record prior

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
for the first billion years.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
That record exists on Mars.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
And this terrain that we're looking at

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000
dates back to 4.6 billion years

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
when Earth and Mars were formed.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
It was a Tuesday.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
(Laughter)

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
This is a map that shows

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
where we've put our spacecraft on the surface of Mars.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Here is Viking I, Viking II.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
This is Opportunity. This is Spirit.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
This is Mars Pathfinder. This is Phoenix,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
we just put two years ago.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Notice all of our rovers and all of our landers

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
have gone to the northern hemisphere.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
That's because the northern hemisphere

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
is the region of the ancient

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
ocean basin.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
There aren't many craters.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
And that's because the water protected the basin

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
from being impacted by asteroids and meteorites.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
But look in the southern hemisphere.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
In the southern hemisphere there are impact craters,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
there are volcanic craters.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Here's Hellas Basin,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
a very very different place, geologically.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Look where the methane is, the methane is in a very

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
rough terrain area.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
What is the best way to unravel

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
the mysteries on Mars that exist?

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
We asked this question 10 years ago.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
We invited 10 of the top Mars scientists

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000
to the Langley Research Center for two days.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
We addressed on the board

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
the major questions that have not been answered.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
And we spent two days deciding

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
how to best answer this question.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
And the result of our meeting

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000
was a robotic rocket-powered airplane we call ARES.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000
It's an Aerial Regional-scale Environmental Surveyor.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
There's a model of ARES here.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
This is a 20-percent scale model.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
This airplane was designed at the Langley Research Center.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
If any place in the world

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
can build an airplane to fly on Mars,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
it's the Langley Research Center,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
for almost 100 years

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
a leading center of aeronautics in the world.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
We fly about a mile above the surface.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
We cover hundreds of miles,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
and we fly about 450 miles an hour.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
We can do things that rovers can't do

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
and landers can't do:

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
We can fly above mountains, volcanoes, impact craters;

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
we fly over valleys;

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
we can fly over surface magnetism,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
the polar caps, subsurface water;

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
and we can search for life on Mars.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
But, of equal importance,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
as we fly through the atmosphere of Mars,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
we transmit that journey,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
the first flight of an airplane outside of the Earth,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
we transmit those images back to Earth.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
And our goal is to inspire the American public

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
who is paying for this mission through tax dollars.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
But more important we will

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
inspire the next generation of scientists,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
technologists, engineers and mathematicians.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
And that's a critical area of national security

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
and economic vitality, to make sure

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
we produce the next generation

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
of scientists, engineers, mathematicians and technologists.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
This is what ARES looks like

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
as it flies over Mars.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
We preprogram it.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
We will fly where the methane is.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
We will have instruments aboard the plane

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
that will sample, every three minutes, the atmosphere of Mars.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
We will look for methane

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
as well as other gasses

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
produced by living systems.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
We will pinpoint where these gases emanate from,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
because we can measure the gradient where it comes from,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
and there, we can direct the next mission

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
to land right in that area.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
How do we transport an airplane to Mars?

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
In two words, very carefully.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
The problem is we don't fly it to Mars,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
we put it in a spacecraft

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
and we send it to Mars.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
The problem is the spacecraft's

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000
largest diameter is nine feet;

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000
ARES is 21-foot wingspan, 17 feet long.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
How do we get it to Mars?

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
We fold it,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
and we transport it in a spacecraft.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
And we have it in something called an aeroshell.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
This is how we do it.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
And we have a little video that describes the sequence.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Video: Seven, six. Green board. Five, four, three, two, one.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Main engine start, and liftoff.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Joel Levine: This is a launch from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
This is the spacecraft taking nine months

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
to get to Mars.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
It enters the atmosphere of Mars.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
A lot of heating,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
frictional heating. It's going 18 thousand miles an hour.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
A parachute opens up to slow it down.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
The thermal tiles fall off.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
The airplane is exposed to the atmosphere for the first time.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
It unfolds.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
The rocket engine begins.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
We believe that in a one-hour flight

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
we can rewrite the textbook on Mars

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
by making high-resolution measurements of the atmosphere,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
looking for gases of biogenic origin,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
looking for gases of volcanic origin,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
studying the surface, studying the magnetism

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
on the surface, which we don't understand,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
as well as about a dozen other areas.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Practice makes perfect.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
How do we know we can do it?

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Because we have tested ARES model,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
several models in a half a dozen wind tunnels

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
at the NASA Langley Research Center for eight years,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
under Mars conditions.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
And, of equal importance

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
is, we test ARES in the Earth's atmosphere,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
at 100,000 feet,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
which is comparable to the density and pressure

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
of the atmosphere on Mars where we'll fly.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Now, 100,000 feet, if you fly cross-country to Los Angeles,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
you fly 37,000 feet.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
We do our tests at 100,000 feet.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
And I want to show you one of our tests.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
This is a half-scale model.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
This is a high-altitude helium balloon.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
This is over Tilamook, Oregon.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
We put the folded airplane on the balloon --

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
it took about three hours to get up there --

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
and then we released it on command

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
at 103,000 feet,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
and we deploy the airplane and everything works perfectly.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
And we've done

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
high-altitude and low-altitude tests,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
just to perfect this technique.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
We're ready to go.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
I have a scale model here.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
But we have a full-scale model

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
in storage at the NASA Langley Research Center.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
We're ready to go. All we need is a check from NASA headquarters

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
(Laughter)

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
to cover the costs.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
I'm prepared to donate my honorarium for today's talk

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
for this mission.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
There's actually no honorarium for anyone for this thing.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
This is the ARES team;

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
we have about 150 scientists, engineers;

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
where we're working with Jet Propulsion Laboratory,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Goddard Space Flight Center,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Ames Research Center and half a dozen major universities

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
and corporations in developing this.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:13.000
It's a large effort. It's all at NASA Langley Research Center.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
And let me conclude by saying

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
not too far from here,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
right down the road in Kittyhawk, North Carolina,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
a little more than 100 years ago

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
history was made

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
when we had the first powered flight of an airplane on Earth.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
We are on the verge right now

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
to make the first flight of an airplane

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
outside the Earth's atmosphere.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
We are prepared to fly this on Mars,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
rewrite the textbook about Mars.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
If you're interested in more information,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
we have a website that describes this exciting

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
and intriguing mission, and why we want to do it.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Thank you very much.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
(Applause)
