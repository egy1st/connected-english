00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
One day, Los Angeles Times columnist

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Steve Lopez was walking along

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
the streets of downtown Los Angeles

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
when he heard beautiful music.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And the source was a man,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
an African-American man,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
charming, rugged, homeless,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
playing a violin that only had two strings.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And I'm telling a story that many of you know,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
because Steve's columns became the basis

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
for a book, which was turned into a movie,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
with Robert Downey Jr. acting as Steve Lopez,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Anthony Ayers,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
the Juilliard-trained double bassist

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
whose promising career was cut short

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
by a tragic affliction with paranoid schizophrenia.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Nathaniel dropped out of Juilliard, he suffered a complete breakdown,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and 30 years later he was living homeless

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
on the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I encourage all of you to read Steve's book or to watch the movie

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
to understand not only the beautiful bond

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
that formed between these two men,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
but how music helped shape that bond,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and ultimately was instrumental -- if you'll pardon the pun --

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
in helping Nathaniel get off the streets.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I met Mr. Ayers in 2008,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
two years ago, at Walt Disney Concert Hall.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
He had just heard a performance of Beethoven's First and Fourth symphonies,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and came backstage and introduced himself.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
He was speaking in a very jovial and gregarious way

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
about Yo-Yo Ma and Hillary Clinton

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and how the Dodgers were never going to make the World Series,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
all because of the treacherous first violin passage work

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
in the last movement of Beethoven's Fourth Symphony.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And we got talking about music, and I got an email from Steve a few days later

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
saying that Nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Now, I should mention that Nathaniel refuses treatment

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
because when he was treated it was with shock therapy

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and Thorazine and handcuffs,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
But as a result now, he is prone to

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
these schizophrenic episodes,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
the worst of which can manifest themselves as

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
him exploding

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and then disappearing for days,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
wandering the streets of Skid Row,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
exposed to its horrors, with the torment of his own mind

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
unleashed upon him.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And Nathaniel was in such a state of agitation

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
when we started our first lesson at Walt Disney Concert Hall --

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
he had a kind of manic glint in his eyes,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
he was lost.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And he was talking about

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
invisible demons and smoke,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and how someone was poisoning him in his sleep.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And I was afraid,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
not for myself, but I was afraid

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
that I was going to lose him,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
that he was going to sink into one of his states,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and that I would ruin his relationship with the violin

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
if I started talking about scales

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and arpeggios and other exciting forms of

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
didactic violin pedagogy.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
(Laughter)

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
So, I just started playing.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And I played the first movement of the Beethoven Violin Concerto.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And as I played,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I understood that there was a profound change

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
occurring in Nathaniel's eyes.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
It was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
a chemical reaction, for which my playing the music

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
was its catalyst.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And Nathaniel's manic rage

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
was transformed into understanding,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000
a quiet curiosity and grace.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And in a miracle, he lifted his own violin

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and he started playing, by ear,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
certain snippets of violin concertos

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
which he then asked me to complete -- Mendelssohn,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Tchaikovsky, Sibelius.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
And we started talking about music, from Bach

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
to Beethoven and Brahms,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Bruckner, all the B's,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
from BartÃ³k, all the way up to Esa-Pekka Salonen.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
And I understood that he not only

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
had an encyclopedic knowledge of music,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
but he related to this music at a personal level.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
He spoke about it with the kind of passion

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
and understanding that I share with my colleagues

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
in the Los Angeles Philharmonic.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And through playing music and talking about music,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
this man had transformed

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
from the paranoid, disturbed man

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
that had just come from walking the streets

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
of downtown Los Angeles

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
to the charming, erudite,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
brilliant, Juilliard-trained musician.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Music is medicine. Music changes us.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
And for Nathaniel, music is sanity.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Because music allows him to take his thoughts

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
and delusions and shape them

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
through his imagination and his creativity,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
into reality.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
And that is an escape

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
from his tormented state.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
And I understood that this was the very essence of art.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
This was the very reason why we made music,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
that we take something that exists within all of us

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
at our very fundamental core,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
our emotions,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and through our artistic lens,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
through our creativity, we're able to shape those emotions into reality.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And the reality of that expression

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
reaches all of us

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000
and moves us, inspires and unites us.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
And for Nathaniel,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
music brought him back into a fold of friends.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
The redemptive power of music brought him back

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
into a family of musicians

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
that understood him,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
that recognized his talents

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
and respected him.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And I will always make music with Nathaniel,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
whether we're at Walt Disney Concert Hall

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
or on Skid Row, because he reminds me

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
why I became a musician.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Thank you.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.000
(Applause)

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Bruno Giussani: Thank you. Thanks.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Robert Gupta.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
(Applause)

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Robert Gupta: I'm going to play something that I shamelessly stole from cellists.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
So, please forgive me.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000
(Laughter)

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
(Music)

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:06.000
(Applause)
