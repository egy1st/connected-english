00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
You know for me, the interest in contemporary forms of slavery

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
started with a leaflet that I picked up in London.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It was the early '90s,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and I was at a public event.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I saw this leaflet and it said,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
"There are millions of slaves in the world today."

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And I thought, "No way, no way."

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And I'm going to admit to hubris.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Because I also, I'm going to admit to you,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I also thought, "How can I be like

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
a hot-shot young full professor

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
who teaches human rights and not know this?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So it can't be true."

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Well, if you teach, if you worship

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
in the temple of learning,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
do not mock the gods,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
because they will take you,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
fill you with curiosity and desire,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and drive you. Drive you with a passion

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
to change things.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I went out and did a lit review,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
3,000 articles on the key word "slavery."

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Two turned out to be about contemporary -- only two.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
All the rest were historical.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
They were press pieces and they were full of outrage,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
they were full of speculation, they were anecdotal --

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
no solid information.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
So, I began to do a research project of my own.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I went to five countries around the world.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I looked at slaves. I met slaveholders,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and I looked very deeply

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
into slave-based businesses

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
because this is an economic crime.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
People do not enslave people to be mean to them.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
They do it to make a profit.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And I've got to tell you, what I found out in the world

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
in four different continents,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
was depressingly familiar.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Like this:

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Agricultural workers in Africa,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
whipped and beaten,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
showing us how they were beaten in the fields

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
before they escaped from slavery

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and met up with our film crew.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
It was mind-blowing.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And I want to be very clear.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I'm talking about real slavery.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
This is not about lousy marriages,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
this is not about jobs that suck.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
This is about people who can not walk away,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
people who are forced to work without pay,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
people who are operating 24/7

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
under a threat of violence

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and have no pay.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
It's real slavery in exactly the same way

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
that slavery would be recognized

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
throughout all of human history.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Now, where is it?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Well, this map in the sort of redder, yellower colors

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
are the places with the highest densities of slavery.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
But in fact that kind of bluey color

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
are the countries where we can't find any cases of slavery.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And you might notice that it's only Iceland and Greenland

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
where we can't find any cases of enslavement

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
around the world.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
We're also particularly interested

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
and looking very carefully

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
at places where

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
slaves are being used to perpetrate

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
extreme environmental destruction.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Around the world, slaves are used to destroy the environment,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
cutting down trees in the Amazon; destroying

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
forest areas in West Africa;

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
mining and spreading mercury around

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
in places like Ghana and the Congo;

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
destroying the coastal ecosystems in South Asia.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
It's a pretty harrowing linkage

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
between what's happening to our environment

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
and what's happening to our human rights.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Now, how on Earth did we get to a situation like this,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
where we have 27 million people

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
in slavery in the year 2010?

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
That's double the number that came out of Africa

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
in the entire transatlantic slave trade.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Well, it builds up with these factors.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
They are not causal, they are actually supporting factors.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
One we all know about, the population explosion:

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
the world goes from two billion people to almost

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
seven billion people in the last 50 years.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Being numerous does not make you a slave.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Add in the increased vulnerability of very large numbers of people

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
in the developing world,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
caused by civil wars, ethnic conflicts,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
kleptocratic governments, disease ... you name it, you know it.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
We understand how that works. In some countries

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
all of those things happen at once,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
like Sierra Leone a few years ago,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000
and push enormous parts ... about a billion people in the world, in fact,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
as we know, live on the edge,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
live in situations where

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
they don't have any opportunity and are usually even destitute.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
But that doesn't make you a slave either.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
What it takes to turn a person who is destitute and vulnerable

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
into a slave, is the absence of the rule of law.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
If the rule of law is sound, it protects

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
the poor and it protects the vulnerable.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
But if corruption creeps in

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
and people don't have the opportunity

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
to have that protection of the rule of law,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
then if you can use violence,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
if you can use violence with impunity,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
you can reach out and harvest the vulnerable

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
into slavery.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Well, that is precisely what has happened around the world.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Though, for a lot of people,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
the people who step

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
into slavery today

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
don't usually get kidnapped or knocked over the head.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
They come into slavery because

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
someone has asked them this question.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
All around the world I've been told an almost identical story.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
People say, "I was home,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
someone came into our village,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
they stood up in the back of a truck, they said, 'I've got jobs,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
who needs a job?'"

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And they did exactly what

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
you or I would do in the same situation.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
They said, "That guy looked sketchy. I was suspicious,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
but my children were hungry.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
We needed medicine.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
I knew I had to do anything I could

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
to earn some money to support the people I care about."

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
They climb into the back of the truck. They go off with the person who recruits them.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Ten miles, 100 miles, 1,000 miles later,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
they find themselves in dirty, dangerous, demeaning work.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
They take it for a little while,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
but when they try to leave, bang!, the hammer comes down,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
and they discover they're enslaved.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Now, that kind of slavery

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
is, again, pretty much what slavery has been all through human history.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000
But there is one thing that is particularly remarkable

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
and novel about slavery today,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
and that is a complete collapse

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
in the price of human beings --

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
expensive in the past, dirt cheap now.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Even the business programs have started

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
picking up on this.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
I just want to share a little clip for you.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Daphne: OK. Llively discussion guaranteed here, as always,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
as we get macro and talk commodities.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Continuing here in the studio with our guest Michael O'Donohue,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
head of commodities at Four Continents Capital Management.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
And we're also joined by Brent Lawson

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
from Lawson Frisk Securities.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Brent Lawson: Happy to be here.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
D: Good to have you with us, Brent.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Now, gentlemen ... Brent, where is your money going this year?

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
BL: Well Daphne, we've been going short on gas and oil recently

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
and casting our net just a little bit wider.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
We really like the human being story a lot.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
If you look at a long-term chart,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
prices are at historical lows and yet global demand

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
for forced labor is still real strong.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
So, that's a scenario that we think we should be capitalizing on.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
D: Michael, what's your take on the people story? Are you interested?

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Michael O'Donoghue: Oh definitely. Non-voluntary labor's greatest advantage

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
as an asset is the endless supply.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
We're not about to run out of people. No other commodity has that.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
BL: Daphne, if I may draw your attention to one thing.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
That is that private equity has been sniffing around,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
and that tells me that this market is about to explode.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Africans and Indians, as usual,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
South Americans, and Eastern Europeans in particular

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
are on our buy list.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
D: Interesting. Micheal, bottom line, what do you recommend?

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
MO: We're recommending to our clients

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
a buy and hold strategy.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
There's no need to play the market.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
There's a lot of vulnerable people out there. It's very exciting.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
D: Exciting stuff indeed. Gentlemen, thank you very much.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Kevin Bales: Okay, you figured it out. That's a spoof.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Though I enjoyed watching

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
your jaws drop, drop, drop, until you got it.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
MTV Europe worked with us and made that spoof,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
and they've been slipping it in between music videos

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
without any introduction, which I think is kind of fun.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Here's the reality.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
The price of human beings across the last 4,000 years

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
in today's money has averaged about 40,000 dollars.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Capital purchase items.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
You can see that the lines cross when the population explodes.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
The average price of a human being today,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
around the world, is about 90 dollars.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
They are more expensive in places like North America.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Slaves cost between 3,000 to 8,000 dollars in North America,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
but I could take you places in India or Nepal

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
where human beings can be acquired for five or 10 dollars.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
They key here is that

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
people have ceased to be that capital purchase item

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
and become like Styrofoam cups.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
You buy them cheaply, you use them,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
you crumple them up, and then when you're done

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
with them you just throw them away.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
These young boys are in Nepal.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
They are basically the transport system

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
on a quarry run by a slaveholder.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
There are no roads there, so they carry loads of stone

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
on their backs, often of their own weight,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
up and down the Himalaya Mountains.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
One of their mothers said to us,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
"You know, we can't survive here,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
but we can't even seem to die either."

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
It's a horrible situation.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
And if there is anything that makes me feel very positive about this,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
it's that there are also --

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
in addition to young men like this who are still enslaved --

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
there are ex-slaves who are now working to free others.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Or, we say, Frederick Douglass is in the house.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
I don't know if you've ever had a daydream

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
about, "Wow. What would it be like to meet Harriet Tubman?

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
What would it be like to meet Frederick Douglass?"

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
I've got to say, one of the most exciting parts about my job

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
is that I get to,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
and I want to introduce you to one of those.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
His name is James Kofi Annan. He was a slave child in Ghana

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
enslaved in the fishing industry,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
and he now, after escape and building a new life,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
has formed an organization that we work closely with

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
to go back and get people out of slavery.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
This is not James, this is one of the kids that he works with.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
James Kofi Annan (Video): He was hit with a paddle

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
in the head. And this reminds me

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
of my childhood when I used to work here.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
KB: James and our country director in Ghana,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Emmanuel Otoo are now receiving regular death threats

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
because the two of them managed to get

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
convictions and imprisonment for three human traffickers

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
for the very first time in Ghana

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
for enslaving people, from the fishing industry,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
for enslaving children.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Now, everything I've been telling you,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
I admit, is pretty disheartening.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
But there is actually a very positive side to this,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
and that is this: The 27 million people

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
who are in slavery today,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
that's a lot of people, but it's also

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
the smallest fraction

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
of the global population to ever be in slavery.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
And likewise, the 40 billion dollars that they generate

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
into the global economy each year

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
is the tiniest proportion of the global economy

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000
to ever be represented by slave labor.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Slavery, illegal in every country

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
has been pushed to the edges of our global society.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And in a way, without us even noticing,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
has ended up standing on the precipice

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
of its own extinction,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
waiting for us to give it a big boot

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
and knock it over. And get rid of it.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
And it can be done.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Now, if we do that, if we put the resources

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
and the focus to it,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
what does it actually cost to get people out of slavery?

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Well, first, before I even tell you the cost

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
I've got to be absolutely clear.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
We do not buy people out of slavery.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Buying people out of slavery is like

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
paying a burglar to get your television back;

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
it's abetting a crime.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Liberation, however, costs some money.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Liberation, and more importantly

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
all the work that comes after liberation.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
It's not an event, it's a process.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
It's about helping people to build lives of dignity,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
stability, economic autonomy,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
citizenship.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Well, amazingly,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
in places like India where costs are very low,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
that family, that three-generation family that you see there

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
who were in hereditary slavery --

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000
so, that granddad there, was born a baby into slavery --

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
but the total cost, amortized

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
across the rest of the work,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
was about 150 dollars to bring that family

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
out of slavery and then take them through a two year process

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
to build a stable life of citizenship and education.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
A boy in Ghana rescued from fishing slavery, about 400 dollars.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
In the United States, North America,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
much more expensive. Legal costs, medical costs ...

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
we understand that it's expensive here:

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
about 30,000 dollars.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
But most of the people in the world in slavery

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
live in those places where

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
the costs are lowest.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
And in fact, the global average is about what it is

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
for Ghana.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
And that means, when you multiply it up,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
the estimated cost of

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
not just freedom but sustainable freedom

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
for the entire 27 million people on the planet in slavery

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
is something like 10.8 billion dollars --

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
what Americans spend on potato chips and pretzels,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
what Seattle is going to spend on its light rail system:

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
usually the annual expenditure in this country on blue jeans,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
or in the last holiday period

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
when we bought GameBoys and iPods and other tech gifts for people,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
we spent 10.8 billion dollars.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
Intel's fourth quarter earnings: 10.8 billion.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
It's not a lot of money at the global level.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
In fact, it's peanuts.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
And the great thing about it is that

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
it's not money down a hole,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
there is a freedom dividend. When you let people out of slavery

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
to work for themselves,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
are they motivated?

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
They take their kids out of the workplace,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
they build a school, they say,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
"We're going to have stuff we've never had before like three squares,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
medicine when we're sick,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
clothing when we're cold."

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
They become consumers and producers

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000
and local economies begin to spiral up very rapidly.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
That's important, all of that

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
about how we rebuild sustainable freedom,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
because we'd never want to repeat

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
what happened in this country in 1865.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Four million people were lifted up out of slavery

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
and then dumped.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Dumped without political participation,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
decent education,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
any kind of real opportunity

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
in terms of economic lives,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
and then sentenced to generations of

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
violence and prejudice and discrimination.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
And America is still paying the price

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
for the botched emancipation of 1865.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
We have made a commitment

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
that we will never let people

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
come out of slavery on our watch,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
and end up as second class citizens.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
It's just not going to happen.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
This is what liberation really looks like.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Children rescued from slavery in the fishing industry in Ghana,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
reunited with their parents,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
and then taken with their parents back to their villages

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
to rebuild their economic well-being

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
so that they become slave-proof --

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
absolutely unenslaveable.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Now, this woman

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
lived in a village in Nepal.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
We'd been working there about a month.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
They had just begun to come out of a hereditary kind of slavery.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
They'd just begun to light up a little bit,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
open up a little bit.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
But when we went to speak with her, when we took this photograph,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000
the slaveholders were still menacing us

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
from the sidelines. They hadn't been really pushed back.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
I was frightened. We were frightened.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
We said to her, "Are you worried? Are you upset?"

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
She said, "No, because we've got hope now.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
How could we not succeed," she said,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
"when people like you from the other side of the world

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
are coming here to stand beside us?"

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Okay, we have to ask ourselves,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
are we willing to live in a world with slavery?

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
If we don't take action, we just leave ourselves open

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
to have someone else jerk the strings

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
that tie us to slavery in the products we buy,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
and in our government policies.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
And yet, if there's one thing that every human being can agree on,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
I think it's that slavery should end.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
And if there is a fundamental violation

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
of our human dignity

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
that we would all say is horrific,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
it's slavery.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
And we've got to say,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
what good is all of our intellectual

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
and political and economic power --

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
and I'm really thinking intellectual power in this room --

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
if we can't use it to bring slavery to an end?

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
I think there is enough intellectual power in this room

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
to bring slavery to an end.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
And you know what? If we can't do that,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
if we can't use our intellectual power to end slavery,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
there is one last question:

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Are we truly free?

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
Okay, thank you so much.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:40.000
(Applause)
