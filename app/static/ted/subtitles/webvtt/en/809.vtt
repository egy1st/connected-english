WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I'm standing in front of you today

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
in all humility,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
wanting to share with you

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
my journey of the last six years

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
in the field of service

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and education.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And I'm not a trained academic.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Neither am I a veteran social worker.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I was 26 years in the corporate world,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
trying to make organizations profitable.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And then in 2003

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I started Parikrma Humanity Foundation

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
from my kitchen table.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The first thing that we did was walk through the slums.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
You know, by the way, there are two million people

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
in Bangalore, who live in 800 slums.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
We couldn't go to all the slums,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
but we tried to cover as much as we could.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
We walked through these slums,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
identified houses where children would never go to school.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
We talked to the parents,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
tried to convince them about sending their children to school.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
We played with the children,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and came back home really tired,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
exhausted, but with images

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
of bright faces, twinkling eyes,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and went to sleep.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
We were all excited to start,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
but the numbers hit us then:

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
200 million children

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
between four to 14 that

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
should be going to school, but do not;

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
100 million children

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
who go to school but cannot read;

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
125 million who cannot do basic maths.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
We also heard that 250 billion Indian rupees

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
was dedicated for government schooling.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Ninety percent of it was spent on teachers' salary

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
and administrators' salary.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And yet, India has nearly

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
the highest teacher absenteeism

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
in the world,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
with one out of four teachers

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
not going to school at all the entire academic year.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Those numbers were absolutely mind-boggling,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
overwhelming, and we were constantly asked,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
"When will you start? How many schools will you start?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
How many children will you get?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
How are you going to scale?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
How are you going to replicate?"

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
It was very difficult not to get scared, not to get daunted.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
But we dug our heels

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
and said, "We're not in the number game.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
We want to take one child at a time

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and take the child right through school,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
sent to college,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and get them prepared for better living,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
a high value job."

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
So, we started Parikrma.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
The first Parikrma school

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
started in a slum

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
where there were 70,000 people

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
living below the poverty line.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Our first school was

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
on a rooftop of a building inside the slums,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
a second story building, the only second story building

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
inside the slums.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And that rooftop did not have

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
any ceiling, only half a tin sheet.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
That was our first school. One hundred sixty-five children.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Indian academic year begins in June.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
So, June it rains, so many a times

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
all of us would be huddled under the tin roof,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
waiting for the rain to stop.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
My God! What a bonding exercise that was.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And all of us

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
that were under that roof are still here together today.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Then came the second school,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
the third school, the fourth school

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
and a junior college.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
In six years now,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
we have four schools, one junior college,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
1,100 children

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
coming from 28 slums

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
and four orphanages.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
(Applause)

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Our dream is very simple:

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
to send each of these kids, get them prepared

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
to be educated

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
but also to live peacefully,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
contented in this conflict-ridden

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
chaotic globalized world.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Now, when you talk global

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
you have to talk English.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
And so all our schools

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
are English medium schools.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
But they know there is this myth

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
that children from the slums

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
cannot speak English well.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
No one in their family has spoken English.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
No one in their generation has spoken English.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
But how wrong it is.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Girl: I like adventurous books, and some of my favorites

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
are Alfred Hitchcock and [unclear]

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
and Hardy Boys.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Although they are like

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
in different contexts,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
one is magical, the other two are like investigation,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
I like those books because

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
they have something special in them.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
The vocabulary used in those books

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
and the style of writing.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
I mean like once I pick up one book

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
I cannot put it down until I finish the whole book.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Even if it takes me four and a half hours,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
or three and half hours to finish my book, I do it.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Boy: I did good research and I got the information

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
[on the] world's fastest cars.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.000
I like Ducati ZZ143,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
because it is the fastest,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
the world's fastest bike,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
and I like Pulsar 220 DTSI

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
because it is India's fastest bike. (Laughter)

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Shukla Bose: Well, that girl that you saw,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
her father sells flowers on the roadside.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And this little boy has been coming to school for five years.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
But isn't it strange that little boys all over the world

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
love fast bikes? (Laughter)

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
He hasn't seen one, he hasn't ridden one, of course,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
but he has done a lot of research through Google search.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
You know, when we started with our English medium schools

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
we also decided to adopt

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
the best curriculum possible,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
the ICSE curriculum.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
And again, there were people who laughed at me

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and said, "Don't be crazy

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
choosing such a tough curriculum for these students.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
They'll never be able to cope."

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Not only do our children cope very well,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
but they excel in it.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
You should just come across to see

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
how well our children do.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
There is also this myth that

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
parents from the slums

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
are not interested in their children going to school;

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
they'd much rather put them to work.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
That's absolute hogwash.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
All parents all over the world

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
want their children to lead a better life than themselves,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
but they need to believe that change is possible.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Video: (Hindi)

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
SB: We have 80 percent attendance

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
for all our parents-teachers meeting.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Sometimes it's even 100 percent,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
much more than many privileged schools.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Fathers have started to attend.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
It's very interesting. When we started our school

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000
the parents would give thumbprints in the attendance register.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Now they have started writing their signature.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
The children have taught them.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
It's amazing how much children can teach.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
We have, a few months ago,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
actually late last year,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
we had a few mothers who came to us and said,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
"You know, we want to learn how to read and write.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Can you teach us?" So, we started an afterschool

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
for our parents, for our mothers.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
We had 25 mothers who came regularly

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
after school to study.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
We want to continue with this program

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
and extend it to all our other schools.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Ninety-eight percent of our fathers are alcoholics.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
So, you can imagine how traumatized

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
and how dysfunctional the houses are where our children come from.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000
We have to send the fathers to de-addiction labs

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
and when they come back,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000
most times sober, we have to find a job for them

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
so that they don't regress.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
We have about three fathers who have been trained to cook.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000
We have taught them nutrition, hygiene.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
We have helped them set up the kitchen

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
and now they are supplying food to all our children.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
They do a very good job because

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
their children are eating their food,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
but most importantly this is the first time

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
they have got respect,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
and they feel that they are doing something worthwhile.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
More than 90 percent of our non-teaching staff

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
are all parents and extended families.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
We've started many programs

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
just to make sure that the child comes to school.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Vocational skill program for the older siblings

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000
so the younger ones are not stopped from coming to school.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
There is also this myth that children from the slums

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
cannot integrate with mainstream.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Take a look at this little girl

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
who was one of the 28 children

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
from all privileged schools,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
best schools in the country

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
that was selected for the Duke University

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
talent identification program

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
and was sent to IIM Ahmedabad.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Video: Girl: Duke IIMA Camp. Whenever we see that IIMA,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
it was such a pride for us to go to that camp.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Everybody was very friendly,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
especially I got a lot of friends.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
And I felt that my English has improved a lot

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
going there and chatting with friends.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
There they met children who are

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
with a different standard and

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
a different mindset, a totally different society.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
I mingled with almost everyone.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
They were very friendly.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
I had very good friends there,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
who are from Delhi, who are from Mumbai.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Even now we are in touch through Facebook.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
After this Ahmedabad trip

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
I've been like a totally different

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
mingling with people and all of those.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Before that I feel like I wasn't like this.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
I don't even mingle, or start speaking with someone so quickly.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:17.000
My accent with English improved a lot.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And I learned football, volleyball,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Frisbee, lots of games.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And I wouldn't want to go to Bangalore. Let me stay here.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Such beautiful food,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
I enjoyed it. It was so beautiful.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
I enjoyed eating food like

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
[unclear] would come and ask me,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
"Yes ma'am, what you want?" It was so good to hear!

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
(Laughter)

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
(Applause)

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
SB: This girl was working as a maid

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
before she came to school.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000
And today she wants to be a neurologist.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Our children are doing brilliantly in sports.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
They are really excelling.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
There is an inter-school athletic competition

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
that is held every year

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
in Bangalore, where 5,000 children participate

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
from 140 best schools in the city.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:19.000
We've got the best school award for three years successively.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
And our children are coming back home

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
with bags full of medals, with lots of admirers and friends.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Last year there were a couple of kids

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
from elite schools that came

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
to ask for admissions in our school.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000
We also have our very own dream team.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Why is this happening? Why this confidence?

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Is it the exposure? We have professors

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
from MIT, Berkeley, Stanford,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Indian Institute of Science

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
who come and teach our children lots of scientific formulas,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
experiments, much beyond the classroom.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Art, music are considered

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
therapy and mediums of expression.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
We also believe that

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
it's the content that is more important.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000
It is not the infrastructure,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
not the toilets, not the libraries,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
but it is what actually happens in this school

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
that is more important.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Creating an environment of learning,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
of inquiry, of exploration

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
is what is true education.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
When we started Parikrma

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
we had no idea which direction we were taking.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
We didn't hire McKinsey to do a business plan.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
But we know for sure that

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
what we want to do today is

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
take one child at a time,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
not get bogged with numbers,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
and actually see the child complete

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
the circle of life,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
and unleash his total potential.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
We do not believe in scale

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
because we believe in quality,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
and scale and numbers will automatically happen.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
We have corporates that have stood behind us,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
and we are able to, now, open more schools.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
But we began with the idea

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
of one child at a time.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
This is five-year-old Parusharam.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
He was begging

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
by a bus stop a few years ago,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
got picked up and is now in an orphanage,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
has been coming to school for the last four and a half months.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
He's in kindergarten.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
He has learned how to speak English.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
We have a model by which kids can speak English

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
and understand English

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
in three month's time.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
He can tell you stories in English

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
of the thirsty crow, of the crocodile

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
and of the giraffe.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
And if you ask him what he likes to do

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
he will say, "I like sleeping.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
I like eating. I like playing."

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
And if you ask him what he wants to do,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
he will say, "I want to horsing."

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Now, "horsing" is going for a horse ride.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
So, Parusharam comes to my office every day.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
He comes for a tummy rub,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
because he believes that will give me luck. (Laughter)

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
When I started Parikrma

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
I began with a great deal of arrogance

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
of transforming the world.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
But today I have been transformed.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
I have been changed with my children.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
I've learned so much from them:

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
love, compassion, imagination

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
and such creativity.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Parusharam is Parikrma

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
with a simple beginning but a long way to go.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
I promise you, Parusharam

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
will speak in the TED conference a few years from now.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Thank you.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:16:02.000
(Applause)
