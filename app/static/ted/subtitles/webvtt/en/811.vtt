00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We are drowning in news.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Reuters alone puts out

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
three and a half million news stories a year.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
That's just one source.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
My question is: How many of those stories

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
are actually going to matter in the long run?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
That's the idea behind The Long News.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
It's a project by The Long Now Foundation,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
which was founded by TEDsters including

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Kevin Kelly and Stewart Brand.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And what we're looking for is news stories that might still matter

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
50 or 100 or 10,000 years from now.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And when you look at the news through that filter,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
a lot falls by the wayside.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
To take the top stories from the A.P. this last year,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
is this going to matter in a decade?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Or this?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Or this?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Really?

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Is this going to matter in 50 or 100 years?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Okay, that was kind of cool.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
(Laughter)

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
But the top story of this past year was the economy,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and I'm just betting that, sooner or later,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
this particular recession is going to be old news.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So, what kind of stories might

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
make a difference for the future?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Well, let's take science.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Someday, little robots will go

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
through our bloodstreams fixing things.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
That someday is already here if you're a mouse.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Some recent stories:

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
nanobees zap tumors with real bee venom;

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
they're sending genes into the brain;

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
a robot they built that can crawl through the human body.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
What about resources? How are we going to feed nine billion people?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
We're having trouble feeding six billion today.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
As we heard yesterday, there's over a billion people hungry.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Britain will starve without genetically modified crops.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Bill Gates, fortunately, has bet a billion on [agricultural] research.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
What about global politics?

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
The world's going to be very different when and if China sets the agenda,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and they may.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
They've overtaken the U.S. as the world's biggest car market,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
they've overtaken Germany as the largest exporter,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and they've started doing DNA tests on kids

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
to choose their careers.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
We're finding all kinds of ways to push back the limits of what we know.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Some recent discoveries:

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
There's an ant colony from Argentina that has now

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
spread to every continent but Antarctica;

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
there's a self-directed robot scientist that's made a discovery --

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
soon, science may no longer need us,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
and life may no longer need us either;

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
a microbe wakes up after 120,000 years.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
It seems that with or without us,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
life will go on.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
But my pick for the top Long News story of this past year

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
was this one: water found on the moon.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Makes it a lot easier to put a colony up there.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
And if NASA doesn't do it, China might,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
or somebody in this room might write a big check.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
My point is this:

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
In the long run, some news stories

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
are more important than others.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
(Applause)
