00:00:00.804 --> 00:00:03.808
Ladies and gentlemen, at TED
we talk a lot about leadership

00:00:03.832 --> 00:00:05.413
and how to make a movement.

00:00:05.437 --> 00:00:07.851
So let's watch a movement happen,
start to finish,

00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:09.119
in under three minutes

00:00:09.143 --> 00:00:10.976
and dissect some lessons from it.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.358
First, of course you know,

00:00:12.382 --> 00:00:15.800
a leader needs the guts
to stand out and be ridiculed.

00:00:17.463 --> 00:00:19.261
What he's doing is so easy to follow.

00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:21.649
Here's his first follower
with a crucial role;

00:00:21.673 --> 00:00:23.976
he's going to show everyone
else how to follow.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.555
Now, notice that the leader
embraces him as an equal.

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:28.524
Now it's not about the leader anymore;

00:00:28.548 --> 00:00:29.976
it's about them, plural.

00:00:30.476 --> 00:00:32.553
Now, there he is calling to his friends.

00:00:32.577 --> 00:00:34.577
Now, if you notice that the first follower

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:37.976
is actually an underestimated form
of leadership in itself.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.976
It takes guts to stand out like that.

00:00:40.484 --> 00:00:44.976
The first follower is what transforms
a lone nut into a leader.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.976
(Laughter)

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.221
(Applause)

00:00:50.245 --> 00:00:51.976
And here comes a second follower.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.398
Now it's not a lone nut,
it's not two nuts --

00:00:54.422 --> 00:00:56.976
three is a crowd, and a crowd is news.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.976
So a movement must be public.

00:00:59.343 --> 00:01:02.576
It's important to show
not just the leader, but the followers,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.496
because you find that new followers
emulate the followers, not the leader.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.572
Now, here come two more people,
and immediately after,

00:01:09.596 --> 00:01:10.976
three more people.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.420
Now we've got momentum.
This is the tipping point.

00:01:13.444 --> 00:01:15.221
Now we've got a movement.

00:01:15.245 --> 00:01:16.245
(Laughter)

00:01:16.651 --> 00:01:18.976
So, notice that, as more people join in,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.564
it's less risky.

00:01:20.588 --> 00:01:22.819
So those that were sitting
on the fence before

00:01:22.843 --> 00:01:24.353
now have no reason not to.

00:01:24.377 --> 00:01:27.717
They won't stand out,
they won't be ridiculed,

00:01:27.741 --> 00:01:30.550
but they will be part
of the in-crowd if they hurry.

00:01:30.574 --> 00:01:33.306
(Laughter)

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.845
So, over the next minute,

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.631
you'll see all of those that prefer
to stick with the crowd

00:01:37.655 --> 00:01:40.916
because eventually they would be
ridiculed for not joining in.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.917
And that's how you make a movement.

00:01:42.941 --> 00:01:44.917
But let's recap some lessons from this.

00:01:45.656 --> 00:01:47.976
So first, if you are the type,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.976
like the shirtless dancing guy
that is standing alone,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.976
remember the importance of nurturing
your first few followers as equals

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.450
so it's clearly
about the movement, not you.

00:01:57.474 --> 00:01:58.536
(Laughter)

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.076
Okay, but we might have missed
the real lesson here.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.976
The biggest lesson, if you noticed --

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.521
did you catch it? --

00:02:04.545 --> 00:02:06.976
is that leadership is over-glorified.

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.777
Yes, it was the shirtless guy
who was first,

00:02:09.801 --> 00:02:11.310
and he'll get all the credit,

00:02:11.334 --> 00:02:13.124
but it was really the first follower

00:02:13.148 --> 00:02:15.976
that transformed the lone nut
into a leader.

00:02:16.488 --> 00:02:18.739
So, as we're told
that we should all be leaders,

00:02:18.763 --> 00:02:20.355
that would be really ineffective.

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:22.783
If you really care
about starting a movement,

00:02:22.807 --> 00:02:25.976
have the courage to follow
and show others how to follow.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.614
And when you find a lone nut
doing something great,

00:02:28.638 --> 00:02:31.976
have the guts to be the first one
to stand up and join in.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.339
And what a perfect place
to do that, at TED.

00:02:34.767 --> 00:02:35.976
Thanks.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.602
(Applause)
