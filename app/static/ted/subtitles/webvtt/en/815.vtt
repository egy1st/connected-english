00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.269
Now, I want to start with a question:

00:00:02.293 --> 00:00:05.706
When was the last time
you were called "childish"?

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:06.976
For kids like me,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.356
being called childish
can be a frequent occurrence.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.976
Every time we make irrational demands,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.976
exhibit irresponsible behavior,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.976
or display any other signs
of being normal American citizens,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.392
we are called childish.

00:00:21.757 --> 00:00:22.976
Which really bothers me.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.976
After all, take a look at these events:

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.976
Imperialism and colonization,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.976
world wars, George W. Bush.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.976
Ask yourself, who's responsible? Adults.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.976
Now, what have kids done?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.976
Well, Anne Frank touched millions

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.976
with her powerful account
of the Holocaust.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.976
Ruby Bridges helped to end
segregation in the United States.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.976
And, most recently,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.693
Charlie Simpson helped to raise
120,000 pounds for Haiti,

00:00:51.717 --> 00:00:53.542
on his little bike.

00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:55.976
So as you can see evidenced
by such examples,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.976
age has absolutely nothing to do with it.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.834
The traits the word "childish" addresses
are seen so often in adults,

00:01:02.858 --> 00:01:05.602
that we should abolish
this age-discriminatory word,

00:01:05.626 --> 00:01:09.372
when it comes to criticizing behavior
associated with irresponsibility

00:01:09.396 --> 00:01:10.776
and irrational thinking.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.703
(Applause)

00:01:16.727 --> 00:01:18.107
Thank you.

00:01:18.131 --> 00:01:22.570
Then again, who's to say
that certain types of irrational thinking

00:01:22.594 --> 00:01:24.976
aren't exactly what the world needs?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.308
Maybe you've had grand plans before,

00:01:27.332 --> 00:01:29.293
but stopped yourself, thinking,

00:01:29.317 --> 00:01:31.617
"That's impossible,"
or "That costs too much,"

00:01:31.641 --> 00:01:33.109
or "That won't benefit me."

00:01:33.522 --> 00:01:36.055
For better or worse, we kids
aren't hampered as much

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:39.230
when it comes to thinking
about reasons why not to do things.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.498
Kids can be full of inspiring
aspirations and hopeful thinking,

00:01:43.522 --> 00:01:45.482
like my wish that no one went hungry,

00:01:45.506 --> 00:01:48.141
or that everything were free,
a kind of utopia.

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.714
How many of you still dream like that,
and believe in the possibilities?

00:01:53.444 --> 00:01:57.832
Sometimes a knowledge of history
and the past failures of Utopian ideals

00:01:57.856 --> 00:01:59.015
can be a burden,

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:01.191
because you know
that if everything were free,

00:02:01.215 --> 00:02:05.119
then the food stocks would become
depleted and scarce and lead to chaos.

00:02:05.508 --> 00:02:08.976
On the other hand, we kids
still dream about perfection.

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:12.855
And that's a good thing, because
in order to make anything a reality,

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:14.976
you have to dream about it first.

00:02:15.925 --> 00:02:17.976
In many ways, our audacity to imagine

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.873
helps push the boundaries of possibility.

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.420
For instance, the Museum
of Glass in Tacoma, Washington,

00:02:24.444 --> 00:02:26.341
my home state -- yoohoo, Washington!

00:02:26.365 --> 00:02:28.976
(Applause)

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.198
has a program called Kids Design Glass,

00:02:31.222 --> 00:02:33.349
and kids draw their own
ideas for glass art.

00:02:33.373 --> 00:02:36.191
The resident artist said
they got some of their best ideas

00:02:36.215 --> 00:02:39.238
from the program, because kids
don't think about the limitations

00:02:39.262 --> 00:02:41.897
of how hard it can be to blow
glass into certain shapes,

00:02:41.921 --> 00:02:43.514
they just think of good ideas.

00:02:43.538 --> 00:02:47.976
Now, when you think of glass, you
might think of colorful Chihuly designs,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.157
or maybe Italian vases,

00:02:50.181 --> 00:02:52.976
but kids challenge glass artists
to go beyond that,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.695
into the realm of brokenhearted snakes

00:02:55.719 --> 00:02:58.949
and bacon boys,
who you can see has meat vision.

00:02:58.973 --> 00:03:00.568
(Laughter)

00:03:00.592 --> 00:03:05.227
Now, our inherent wisdom doesn't
have to be insider's knowledge.

00:03:05.631 --> 00:03:08.821
Kids already do a lot
of learning from adults,

00:03:08.845 --> 00:03:10.623
and we have a lot to share.

00:03:10.647 --> 00:03:13.929
I think that adults should
start learning from kids.

00:03:13.953 --> 00:03:15.357
Now, I do most of my speaking

00:03:15.381 --> 00:03:18.023
in front of an education crowd --
teachers and students,

00:03:18.047 --> 00:03:19.207
and I like this analogy:

00:03:19.231 --> 00:03:21.722
It shouldn't be a teacher
at the head of the class,

00:03:21.746 --> 00:03:23.539
telling students, "Do this, do that."

00:03:23.563 --> 00:03:25.976
The students should teach their teachers.

00:03:26.791 --> 00:03:29.942
Learning between grown-ups
and kids should be reciprocal.

00:03:30.475 --> 00:03:32.976
The reality, unfortunately,
is a little different,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.976
and it has a lot to do
with trust, or a lack of it.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.372
Now, if you don't trust someone,
you place restrictions on them, right?

00:03:39.396 --> 00:03:43.318
If I doubt my older sister's ability
to pay back the 10 percent interest

00:03:43.342 --> 00:03:44.975
I established on her last loan,

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:47.976
I'm going to withhold her ability
to get more money from me,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.374
until she pays it back.

00:03:49.398 --> 00:03:50.565
(Laughter)

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:52.488
True story, by the way.

00:03:52.512 --> 00:03:54.976
Now, adults seem to have

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.676
a prevalently restrictive
attitude towards kids,

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.976
from every "Don't do that, don't do this"
in the school handbook,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.744
to restrictions on school Internet use.

00:04:04.768 --> 00:04:07.801
As history points out,
regimes become oppressive

00:04:07.825 --> 00:04:10.048
when they're fearful
about keeping control.

00:04:10.072 --> 00:04:12.406
And although adults
may not be quite at the level

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:13.976
of totalitarian regimes,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.976
kids have no or very little say
in making the rules,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.215
when really, the attitude
should be reciprocal,

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:21.936
meaning that the adult
population should learn

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.976
and take into account the wishes
of the younger population.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.976
Now, what's even worse than restriction,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.572
is that adults often
underestimate kids' abilities.

00:04:30.596 --> 00:04:33.754
We love challenges, but when
expectations are low,

00:04:33.778 --> 00:04:35.389
trust me, we will sink to them.

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.524
My own parents had anything
but low expectations

00:04:39.548 --> 00:04:40.841
for me and my sister.

00:04:41.484 --> 00:04:46.603
Okay, so they didn't tell us to become
doctors or lawyers or anything like that,

00:04:46.627 --> 00:04:52.225
but my dad did read to us about Aristotle
and pioneer germ-fighters,

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:53.976
when lots of other kids were hearing

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.048
"The Wheels on the Bus
Go Round and Round."

00:04:56.072 --> 00:04:59.940
Well, we heard that one too, but
"Pioneer Germ Fighters" totally rules.

00:04:59.964 --> 00:05:00.977
(Laughter)

00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:03.975
I loved to write from the age
of four, and when I was six,

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:07.976
my mom bought me my own laptop
equipped with Microsoft Word.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.410
Thank you, Bill Gates, and thank you, Ma.

00:05:10.434 --> 00:05:13.976
I wrote over 300 short stories
on that little laptop,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.976
and I wanted to get published.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.976
Instead of just scoffing at this heresy
that a kid wanted to get published,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.976
or saying wait until you're older,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.920
my parents were really supportive.

00:05:25.563 --> 00:05:28.341
Many publishers were not
quite so encouraging.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.976
One large children's
publisher ironically said

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.817
that they didn't work with children.

00:05:34.261 --> 00:05:37.490
Children's publisher not
working with children?

00:05:37.514 --> 00:05:40.673
I don't know, you're kind
of alienating a large client there.

00:05:40.697 --> 00:05:42.379
(Laughter)

00:05:42.403 --> 00:05:48.231
One publisher, Action Publishing, was
willing to take that leap and trust me,

00:05:48.255 --> 00:05:49.945
and to listen to what I had to say.

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:53.518
They published my first book,
"Flying Fingers," you see it here.

00:05:53.542 --> 00:05:56.976
And from there on, it's gone
to speaking at hundreds of schools,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.023
keynoting to thousands of educators,

00:05:59.047 --> 00:06:01.570
and finally, today, speaking to you.

00:06:01.594 --> 00:06:03.530
I appreciate your attention today,

00:06:03.554 --> 00:06:06.380
because to show that you
truly care, you listen.

00:06:07.619 --> 00:06:09.976
But there's a problem
with this rosy picture

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.976
of kids being so much better than adults.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.309
Kids grow up and become
adults just like you.

00:06:16.333 --> 00:06:17.976
(Laughter)

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.364
Or just like you? Really?

00:06:20.388 --> 00:06:23.856
The goal is not to turn kids
into your kind of adult,

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.976
but rather, better adults
than you have been,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.316
which may be a little challenging,
considering your guys' credentials.

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:30.498
(Laughter)

00:06:30.522 --> 00:06:31.976
But the way progress happens,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.976
is because new generations and new eras

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.976
grow and develop and become
better than the previous ones.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.158
It's the reason we're not
in the Dark Ages anymore.

00:06:41.547 --> 00:06:43.976
No matter your position or place in life,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.976
it is imperative to create
opportunities for children,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.976
so that we can grow up to blow you away.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.886
(Laughter)

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:54.976
Adults and fellow TEDsters,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.976
you need to listen and learn from kids,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.663
and trust us and expect more from us.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.229
You must lend an ear today,

00:07:03.253 --> 00:07:05.951
because we are the leaders
of tomorrow, which means

00:07:05.975 --> 00:07:08.777
we're going to take care of you
when you're old and senile.

00:07:08.801 --> 00:07:10.094
No, just kidding.

00:07:10.118 --> 00:07:11.118
(Laughter)

00:07:11.142 --> 00:07:13.837
No, really, we are going
to be the next generation,

00:07:13.861 --> 00:07:16.146
the ones who will bring
this world forward.

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:19.321
And in case you don't think
that this really has meaning for you,

00:07:19.345 --> 00:07:20.976
remember that cloning is possible,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.286
and that involves going
through childhood again,

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.976
in which case you'll want to be
heard, just like my generation.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.976
Now, the world needs opportunities
for new leaders and new ideas.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.976
Kids need opportunities
to lead and succeed.

00:07:36.296 --> 00:07:38.161
Are you ready to make the match?

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:43.121
Because the world's problems
shouldn't be the human family's heirloom.

00:07:43.145 --> 00:07:44.976
Thank you.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.976
(Applause)

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Thank you. Thank you.
