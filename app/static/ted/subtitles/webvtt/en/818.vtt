00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
"People do stupid things.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
That's what spreads HIV."

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
This was a headline in a U.K. newspaper,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The Guardian, not that long ago.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I'm curious, show of hands, who agrees with it?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Well, one or two brave souls.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
This is actually a direct quote from an epidemiologist

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
who's been in field of HIV for 15 years,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
worked on four continents,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and you're looking at her.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And I am now going to argue

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
that this is only half true.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
People do get HIV because they do stupid things,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
but most of them are doing stupid things

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
for perfectly rational reasons.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Now, "rational" is the dominant paradigm

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
in public health,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and if you put your public health nerd glasses on,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
you'll see that if we give people the information that they need

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
about what's good for them and what's bad for them,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
if you give them the services

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
that they can use to act on that information,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and a little bit of motivation,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
people will make rational decisions

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and live long and healthy lives.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Wonderful.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
That's slightly problematic for me because I work in HIV,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and although I'm sure you all know

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
that HIV is about poverty and gender inequality,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and if you were at TED '07

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
it's about coffee prices ...

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Actually, HIV's about sex and drugs,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and if there are two things that make

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
human beings a little bit irrational,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
they are erections and addiction.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
(Laughter)

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
So, let's start with what's rational for an addict.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Now, I remember speaking to an Indonesian friend of mine, Frankie.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
We were having lunch and he was telling me

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
about when he was in jail in Bali for a drug injection.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
It was someone's birthday, and they had very kindly

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
smuggled some heroin into jail,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and he was very generously sharing it out

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
with all of his colleagues.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And so everyone lined up,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
all the smackheads in a row,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and the guy whose birthday it was

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
filled up the fit,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and he went down and started injecting people.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
So he injects the first guy,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and then he's wiping the needle on his shirt,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and he injects the next guy.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And Frankie says, "I'm number 22 in line,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and I can see the needle coming down towards me,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and there is blood all over the place.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
It's getting blunter and blunter.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And a small part of my brain is thinking,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
'That is so gross

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
and really dangerous,'

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
but most of my brain is thinking,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
'Please let there be some smack left

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
by the time it gets to me.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Please let there be some left.'"

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And then, telling me this story,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Frankie said,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
"You know ... God,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
drugs really make you stupid."

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And, you know, you can't fault him for accuracy.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
But, actually, Frankie, at that time,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
was a heroin addict and he was in jail.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
So his choice was either

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
to accept that dirty needle or not to get high.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And if there's one place you really want to get high,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
it's when you're in jail.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
But I'm a scientist

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and I don't like to make data out of anecdotes,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
so let's look at some data.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
We talked to 600 drug addicts

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
in three cities in Indonesia,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
and we said, "Well, do you know how you get HIV?"

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
"Oh yeah, by sharing needles."

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
I mean, nearly 100 percent. Yeah, by sharing needles.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And, "Do you know where you can get a clean needle

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
at a price you can afford to avoid that?"

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
"Oh yeah." Hundred percent.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
"We're smackheads; we know where to get clean needles."

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
"So are you carrying a needle?"

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
We're actually interviewing people on the street,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
in the places where they're hanging out and taking drugs.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
"Are you carrying clean needles?"

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
One in four, maximum.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
So no surprises then that

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
the proportion that actually used clean needles

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
every time they injected in the last week

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
is just about one in 10,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and the other nine in 10 are sharing.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
So you've got this massive mismatch;

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
everyone knows that

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
if they share they're going to get HIV,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
but they're all sharing anyway.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
So what's that about? Is it like you get a better high if you share or something?

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
We asked that to a junkie and they're like, "Are you nuts?"

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
You don't want to share a needle anymore than you want

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
to share a toothbrush even with someone you're sleeping with.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
There's just kind of an ick factor there.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
"No, no. We share needles because we don't want to go to jail."

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
So, in Indonesia at this time,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
if you were carrying a needle and the cops rounded you up,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
they could put you into jail.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And that changes the equation slightly, doesn't it?

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Because your choice now is either

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
I use my own needle now,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
or I could share a needle now

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and get a disease that's going to

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
possibly kill me 10 years from now,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
or I could use my own needle now

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
and go to jail tomorrow.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
And while junkies think that

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
it's a really bad idea to expose themselves to HIV,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
they think it's a much worse idea

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
to spend the next year in jail

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
where they'll probably end up in Frankie's situation

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and expose themselves to HIV anyway.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
So, suddenly it becomes perfectly rational

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
to share needles.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Now, let's look at it from a policy maker's point of view.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
This is a really easy problem.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
For once, your incentives are aligned.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
We've got what's rational for public health.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
You want people to use clean needles --

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and junkies want to use clean needles.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
So we could make this problem go away

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
simply by making clean needles universally available

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
and taking away the fear of arrest.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Now, the first person to figure that out

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
and do something about it on a national scale

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
was that well-known, bleeding heart liberal

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Margaret Thatcher.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And she put in the world's first

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
national needle exchange program,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
and other countries followed suit: Australia, The Netherlands and few others.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
And in all of those countries, you can see,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
not more than four percent of injectors

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
ever became infected with HIV.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Now, places that didn't do this -- New York City for example,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Moscow, Jakarta --

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
we're talking, at its peak,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
one in two injectors

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
infected with this fatal disease.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Now, Margaret Thatcher didn't do this

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
because she has any great love for junkies.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
She did it because she ran a country

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
that had a national health service.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
So, if she didn't invest in effective prevention,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
she was going to have pick up the costs

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
of treatment later on,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
and obviously those are much higher.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
So she was making a politically rational decision.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Now, if I take out my

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
public health nerd glasses here

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
and look at these data,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
it seems like a no-brainer, doesn't it?

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
But in this country,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
where the government apparently does not feel compelled

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
to provide health care for citizens, (Laughter)

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
we've taken a very different approach.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
So what we've been doing in the United States

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
is reviewing the data -- endlessly reviewing the data.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
So, these are reviews of hundreds of studies

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
by all the big muckety-mucks

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
of the scientific pantheon in the United States,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
and these are the studies that show

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
needle programs are effective -- quite a lot of them.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Now, the ones that show that needle programs aren't effective --

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
you think that's one of these annoying dynamic slides

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
and I'm going to press my dongle and the rest of it's going to come up,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
but no -- that's the whole slide.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
(Laughter)

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
There is nothing on the other side.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
So, completely irrational,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
you would think.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Except that, wait a minute, politicians are rational, too,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
and they're responding to what they think the voters want.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
So what we see is that voters respond

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
very well to things like this

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
and not quite so well to things like this.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:36.000
(Laughter)

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
So it becomes quite rational

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
to deny services to injectors.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Now let's talk about sex.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Are we any more rational about sex?

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Well, I'm not even going to address

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
the clearly irrational positions

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
of people like the Catholic Church,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
who think somehow that if you give out condoms,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000
everyone's going to run out and have sex.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
I don't know if Pope Benedict

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
watches TEDTalks online,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
but if you do, I've got news for you Benedict --

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
I carry condoms all the time

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
and I never get laid.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
It's not that easy!

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Here, maybe you'll have better luck.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:24.000
(Applause)

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Okay, seriously,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
HIV is actually not that easy

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
to transmit sexually.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
So, it depends on how much virus there is

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
in your blood and in your body fluids.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
And what we've got is a very, very high level of virus

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
right at the beginning when you're first infected,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
then you start making antibodies,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
and then it bumps along at quite low levels

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
for a long time -- 10 or 12 years --

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
you have spikes if you get another sexually transmitted infection.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
But basically, nothing much is going on

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
until you start to get symptomatic AIDS,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
and by that stage,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
you're not looking great, you're not feeling great,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
you're not having that much sex.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
So the sexual transmission of HIV

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
is essentially determined by how many partners you have

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
in these very short spaces of time

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
when you have peak viremia.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Now, this makes people crazy

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
because it means that you have to talk about

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
some groups having more sexual partners

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
in shorter spaces of time than other groups,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
and that's considered stigmatizing.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
I've always been a bit curious about that

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
because I think stigma is a bad thing,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
whereas lots of sex is quite a good thing,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
but we'll leave that be.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
The truth is that 20 years

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
of very good research

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
have shown us that

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
there are groups that are more likely to turnover

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
large numbers of partners in a short space of time.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
And those groups are, globally,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
people who sell sex and their more regular partners.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
They are gay men on the party scene

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
who have, on average, three times more partners

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
than straight people on the party scene.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
And they are heterosexuals

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
who come from countries that have

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
traditions of polygamy

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
and relatively high levels of female autonomy,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
and almost all of those countries are in east or southern Africa.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
And that is reflected in the epidemic that we have today.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
You can see these horrifying figures from Africa.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
These are all countries in southern Africa

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
where between one in seven,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
and one in three

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
of all adults,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
are infected with HIV.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Now, in the rest of the world,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
we've got basically nothing going on in the general population --

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
very, very low levels --

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
but we have extraordinarily high levels of HIV

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
in these other populations who are at highest risk:

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
drug injectors, sex workers

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
and gay men.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
And you'll note, that's the local data from Los Angeles:

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
25 percent prevalence among gay men.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Of course, you can't get HIV just by having unprotected sex.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
You can only HIV by having unprotected sex

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
with a positive person.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
In most of the world,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
these few prevention failures

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
notwithstanding,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
we are actually doing quite well these days

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
in commercial sex:

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
condom use rates are between 80 and 100 percent

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
in commercial sex in most countries.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
And, again, it's because of an alignment of the incentives.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
What's rational for public health

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
is also rational for individual sex workers

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
because it's really bad for business to have another STI.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
No one wants it.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
And, actually, clients don't want to go home with a drip either.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
So essentially, you're able to achieve

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
quite high rates of condom use in commercial sex.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
But in "intimate" relations

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
it's much more difficult because,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
with your wife or your boyfriend

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
or someone that you hope might turn into one of those things,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
we have this illusion of romance

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
and trust and intimacy,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
and nothing is quite so unromantic

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
as the, "My condom or yours, darling?" question.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
So in the face of that,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
you really need quite a strong incentive

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
to use condoms.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
This, for example, this gentleman is called Joseph.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
He's from Haiti and he has AIDS.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
And he's probably not having a lot of sex right now,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
but he is a reminder in the population,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
of why you might want to be

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
using condoms.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
This is also in Haiti and is a reminder

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
of why you might want to be having sex, perhaps.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Now, funnily enough, this is also Joseph

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
after six months on antiretroviral treatment.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Not for nothing do we call it the Lazarus Effect.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
But it is changing the equation

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
of what's rational

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
in sexual decision-making.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
So, what we've got --

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
some people say, "Oh, it doesn't matter very much

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
because, actually, treatment is effective prevention

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
because it lowers your viral load and therefore

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
makes it more difficult to transmit HIV."

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
So, if you look at the viremia thing again,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
if you do start treatment when you're sick,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
well, what happens? Your viral load comes down.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
But compared to what? What happens if you're not on treatment?

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Well, you die,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
so your viral load goes to zero.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
And all of this green stuff here, including the spikes --

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000
which are because you couldn't get to the pharmacy,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
or you ran out of drugs, or you went on a three day party binge

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
and forgot to take your drugs,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
or because you've started to get resistance, or whatever --

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
all of that is virus

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
that wouldn't be out there, except for treatment.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Now, am I saying, "Oh, well, great prevention strategy.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Let's just stop treating people."

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Of course not, of course not.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
We need to expand antiretroviral treatment as much as we can.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
But what I am doing is calling into question

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
those people who say that more treatment

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
is all the prevention we need.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
That's simply not necessarily true,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
and I think we can learn a lot from the experience of gay men

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
in rich countries where treatment has been widely available

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
for going on 15 years now.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
And what we've seen is

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
that, actually, condom use rates,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
which were very, very high --

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
the gay community responded very rapidly to HIV,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
with extremely little help

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
from public health nerds, I would say --

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
that condom use rate has come down dramatically since treatment

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
for two reasons really:

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
One is the assumption of, "Oh well,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
if he's infected, he's probably on meds,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
and his viral load's going to be low, so I'm pretty safe."

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
And the other thing is that people are simply

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
not as scared of HIV

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
as they were of AIDS, and rightly so.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
AIDS was a disfiguring disease that killed you,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
and HIV is an invisible virus

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
that makes you take a pill every day.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
And that's boring,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
but is it as boring as

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
having to use a condom every time you have sex,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
no matter how drunk you are,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
no matter how many poppers you've taken, whatever?

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
If we look at the data, we can see that

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
the answer to that question

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
is, mmm.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
So these are data from Scotland.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
You see the peak in drug injectors

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
before they started the national needle exchange program.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Then it came way down.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
And both in heterosexuals -- mostly in commercial sex --

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
and in drug users,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
you've really got nothing much going on after treatment begins,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
and that's because of that alignment of incentives

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
that I talked about earlier.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
But in gay men,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
you've got quite a dramatic rise

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
starting three or four years

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
after treatment became widely available.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
This is of new infections.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
What does that mean?

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
It means that the combined effect of being less worried

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
and having more virus out there in the population --

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
more people living longer, healthier lives,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
more likely to be getting laid

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
with HIV --

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
is outweighing the effects of lower viral load,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
and that's a very worrisome thing.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
What does it mean?

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
It means we need to be doing more prevention the more treatment we have.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
Is that what's happening?

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
No, and I call it the "compassion conundrum."

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
We've talked a lot about compassion the last couple of days,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
and what's happening really is that people are

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
unable quite to bring themselves to put in

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
good sexual and reproductive health services for sex workers,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
unable quite to be giving out needles to junkies.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
But once they've gone from being

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
transgressive people whose behaviors we don't want to condone

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
to being AIDS victims,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
we come over all compassionate

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
and buy them incredibly expensive drugs for the rest of their lives.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
It doesn't make any sense

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
from a public health point of view.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
I want to give what's very nearly the last word to Ines.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
Ines is a a transgender hooker on the streets of Jakarta;

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
she's a chick with a dick.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Why does she do that job?

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Well, of course, because she's forced into it

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
because she doesn't have any better option, etc., etc.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
And if we could just teach her to sew

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
and get her a nice job in a factory, all would be well.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
This is what factory workers earn in an hour in Indonesia:

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
on average, 20 cents.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
It varies a bit province to province.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
I do speak to sex workers, 15,000 of them

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
for this particular slide,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
and this is what sex workers

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
say they earn in an hour.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
So it's not a great job, but for a lot of people

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
it really is quite a rational choice.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Okay, Ines.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000
We've got the tools, the knowledge and the cash,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
and commitment to preventing HIV too.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Ines: So why is prevalence still rising?

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
It's all politics.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
When you get to politics, nothing makes sense.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Elizabeth Pisani: "When you get to politics, nothing makes sense."

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
So, from the point of view of a sex worker,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
politicians are making no sense.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
From the point of view of a public health nerd,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
junkies are doing dumb things.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
The truth is that everyone has a different rationale.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
There are as many different ways of being rational

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
as there are human beings on the planet,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
and that's one of the glories of human existence.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
But those ways of being rational

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
are not independent of one another,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
so it's rational for

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
a drug injector to share needles

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
because of a stupid decision that's made by a politician,

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
and it's rational for a politician

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
to make that stupid decision

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
because they're responding to

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
what they think the voters want.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
But here's the thing:

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
we are the voters.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
We're not all of them, of course, but TED is a community of opinion leaders.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
And everyone who's in this room,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
and everyone who's watching this out there on the web,

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
I think, has a duty to demand of their politicians

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
that we make policy based on scientific evidence

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
and on common sense.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
It's going to be really hard for us

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
to individually affect what's rational

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
for every Frankie and every Ines out there,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
but you can at least use your vote

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
to stop politicians doing stupid things

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
that spread HIV.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Thank you.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:50.000
(Applause)
