WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
It's not about technology,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
it's about people and stories.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I could show you

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
what recently was on television

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
as a high quality video:

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
60 Minutes, many of you may have seen it.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And it was the now director of the entire piece

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
of the veteran's administration --

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
who, himself, had lost an arm 39 years ago

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
in Vietnam --

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
who was adamantly opposed to these crazy devices

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
that don't work.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And it turns out that with 60 Minutes cameras rolling in the background,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
after he pretty much made his position clear on this --

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
he had his hook and he had his --

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
he wore this arm for less than two hours

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and was able to pour himself a drink and got quite emotional over the fact

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
that, quote -- his quote --

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
it's the first time he's felt like he's had an arm in 39 years.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
But that would sort of be jumping to the middle of the story,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and I'm not going to show you that polished video.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I'm going to, instead, in a minute or two,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
show you an early, crude video

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
because I think it's

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
a better way to tell a story.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
A few years ago I was visited by

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
the guy that runs DARPA,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
the people that fund all the advanced technologies

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
that businesses and universities probably wouldn't take the risk of doing.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
They have a particular interest in ones that will help our soldiers.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I get this sort of unrequested -- by me anyway -- visit,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and sitting in my conference room is a very senior surgeon

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
from the military

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and the guy that runs DARPA.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
They proceed to tell me a story which comes down

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
to basically the following. We have used such advanced technologies

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
now and made them available

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
in the most remote places that we put soldiers:

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
hills of Afghanistan, Iraq ...

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
They were quite proud of the fact that

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
you know, before the dust clears,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
if some soldier has been hurt

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
they will have collected him or her, they will have brought him back,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
they will be getting world-class triage emergency care

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
faster than you and I would be getting it if we were hurt

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
in a car accident in a major city in the United States.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
That's the good news.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
The bad news is if they've collected this person

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and he or she is missing an arm or leg,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
part of the face, it's probably not coming back.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
So, they started giving me the statistics on how many of these kids had lost an arm.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And then the surgeon pointed out, with a lot of anger,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
he said, "Why is it? At the end of the Civil War,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
they were shooting each other with muskets. If somebody lost an arm,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
we gave them a wooden stick with a hook on it.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Now we've got F18s and F22s,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
and if somebody loses an arm,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
we give them a plastic stick with a hook on it."

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
And they basically said, "This is unacceptable,"

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and then the punchline: "So, Dean,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
we're here because you make medical stuff.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
You're going to give us an arm."

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And I was waiting for the 500 pages of bureaucracy,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
paperwork and DODs.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
No, the guy says,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
"We're going to bring a guy into this conference room,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
and wearing the arm you're going to give us,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
he or she is going to pick up a raisin or a grape

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
off this table.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
If it's the grape, they won't break it."

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Great he needs efferent, afferent, haptic response sensors.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
"If it's the raisin, they won't drop it."

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
So he wants fine motor control: flex at the wrist,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
flex at the elbow, abduct and flex at the shoulder.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Either way they were going to eat it.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
"Oh, by the way Dean. It's going to fit on a 50th percentile female frame --

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
namely 32 inches from the long finger --

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and weigh less than nine pounds."

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
50th percentile female frame.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
"And it's going to be completely self contained including all its power."

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
So, they finished that. And I, as you can tell,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
am a bashful guy.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
I told them they're nuts.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
(Laughter)

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
They've been watching too much "Terminator."

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
(Laughter)

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Then, the surgeon says to me,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
"Dean, you need to know

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
more than two dozen of these kids have come back

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
bilateral."

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Now, I cannot imagine --

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
I'm sorry, you may have a better

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
imagination than I do --

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
I can't imagine losing my arm,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
and typically at 22 years old.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
But compared to that, losing two?

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Seems like that would be an inconvenience.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Anyway, I went home that night. I thought about it.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
I literally could not sleep

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
thinking about, "I wonder how you'd roll over

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
with no shoulders."

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
So, I decided we've got to do this.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
And trust me, I've got a day job, I've got a lot of day jobs.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Most of my day job keeps me busy

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
funding my fantasies like FIRST and water and power ....

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
And I've got a lot of day jobs.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
But I figured I gotta do this.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Did a little investigation,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
went down to Washington, told them

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
I still think they're nuts but we're going to do it.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And I told them I'd build them an arm.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
I told them it would probably take five years to get through the FDA,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
and probably 10 years to be reasonably functional.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Look what it takes to make things like iPods.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
"Great," he said, "You got two years."

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000
(Laughter)

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
I said, "I'll tell you what. I'll build you an arm

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
that's under nine pounds

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
that has all that capability in one year.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
It will take the other nine to make it functional and useful."

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
We sort of agreed to disagree.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
I went back and I started putting a team together,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
the best guys I could find with a passion to do this.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
At the end of exactly one year

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
we had a device with 14 degrees of freedom,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
all the sensors, all the microprocessors,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
all the stuff inside.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
I could show you it with a cosmesis on it

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
that's so real it's eerie, but then you wouldn't see

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
all this cool stuff.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
I then thought it would be years

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
before we'd be able to make it really, really useful.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
It turned out, as I think you could see

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
in Aimee's capabilities and attitudes,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
people with a desire to do something

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
are quite remarkable and nature is quite adaptable.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Anyway, with less than 10 hours of use,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
two guys -- one that's bilateral.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
He's literally, he's got no shoulder on one side,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
and he's high trans-humeral on the other.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And that's Chuck and Randy together,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
after 10 hours -- were playing in our office.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
And we took some pretty cruddy home movies.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
At the end of the one I'm going to show, it's only about a minute

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
and a couple of seconds long,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Chuck does something that to this day I'm jealous of,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
I can't do it.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
He picks up a spoon, picks it up,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
scoops out some Shredded Wheat and milk,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
holds the spoon level

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
as he translates it, moving all these joints simultaneously,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
to his mouth, and he doesn't drop any milk.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000
(Laughter)

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
I cannot do that.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
(Laughter)

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
His wife was standing behind me.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
She's standing behind me at the time

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
and she says, "Dean,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Chuck hasn't fed himself in 19 years.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
So, you've got a choice:

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
We keep the arm, or you keep Chuck."

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
So, can we see that?

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
This is Chuck showing simultaneous control

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
of all the joints.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
He's punching our controls guy. The guy behind him

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
is our engineer/surgeon,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
which is a convenient guy to have around.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
There's Randy, these guys are passing a rubber

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
little puck between them.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
And just as in the spirit of FIRST,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
gracious professionalism, they are quite proud of this,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
so they decide to share a drink.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
This is a non-trivial thing to do, by the way.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Imagine doing that with a wooden stick and a hook on the end of it,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
doing either of those.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Now Chuck is doing something quite extraordinary,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000
at least for my limited physical skill.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
And now he's going to do what DARPA asked me for.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
He's going to pick up a grape -- he didn't drop it,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
he didn't break it --

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
and he's going to eat it.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
So, that's where we were

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
at the end of about 15 months.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:08.000
(Applause)

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
But, as I've learned from Richard,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000
the technology, the processors, the sensors, the motors,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
is not the story.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
I hadn't dealt with this kind of problem

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
or frankly, this whole segment

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
of the medical world.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
I'll give you some astounding things that have happened

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
as we started this.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.000
After we were pretty much convinced we had a good design,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
and we'd have to make all the standard engineering trade-offs you always make --

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
you can always get three out of four of anything you want;

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
the weight, the size, the cost, the functionality --

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
I put a bunch of guys in my plane

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
and I said, "We're flying down to Walter Reed, and we're going talk to these kids,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
because frankly it doesn't matter whether we like this arm.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
It doesn't matter whether the

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Department of Defense likes this arm."

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
When I told them that they weren't entirely enthusiastic,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
but I told them, "It really doesn't matter what their opinion is.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
There is only one opinion that matters,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
the kids that are either going to use it or not."

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
I told a bunch of my engineers, "Look we're going to walk into Walter Reed,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
and you're going to see people, lots of them,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
missing major body parts.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
They're probably going to be angry, depressed, frustrated.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
We're probably going to have to give them support, encouragement.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
But we've got to extract from them

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
enough information to make sure we're doing the right thing."

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
We walked into Walter Reed and I could not have been more wrong.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
We did see a bunch of people,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
a lot of them missing a lot of body parts,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
and parts they had left were burned;

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
half a face gone, an ear burned off.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
They were sitting at a table. They were brought together for us.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
And we started asking them all questions.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
"Look," I'd say to them, "We're not quite as good as nature yet.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
I could give you fine motor control,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
or I could let you curl 40 pounds;

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
I probably can't do both.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
I can give you fast control

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
with low reduction ratios in these gears,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
or I can give you power;

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
I can't give you both.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And we were trying to get them to all help us

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
know what to give them.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Not only were they enthusiastic, they kept thinking

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
they're there to help us.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
"Well, would it help if I ..."

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
"Guys, and woman,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
you've given enough.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
We're here to help you. We need data. We need to know

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
what you need."

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
After a half an hour, maybe, there was one guy at the far end of the table

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
who wasn't saying much.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
You could see he was missing an arm.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
He was leaning on his other arm.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
I called down to the end, "Hey, you haven't said much.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
If we needed this or this, what would you want?"

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
And he said, "You know,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
I'm the lucky guy at this table.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
I lost my right arm,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
but I'm a lefty."

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000
(Laughter)

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
So, he wouldn't say much.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
He had a great spirit, like all the rest of them had great spirits.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
And he made a few comments.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
And then the meeting ended. We said goodbye to all these guys.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
And that guy pushed himself back from the table ...

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
he has no legs.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
So, we left.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
And I was thinking,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
"We didn't give them support and encouragement;

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
they gave it to us.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
They're not finished giving yet."

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
It was astounding.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
So, we went back.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
And I started working harder, faster.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Then we went out to Brooke Army Medical Center.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000
And we saw lots of these kids, lots of them.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
And it was astounding

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
how positive they are.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
So, we went back,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
and we've been working harder yet.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
We're in clinical trials,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
we've got five of them on people.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
We're screaming along.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
And I get a call and we go back

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
to Washington.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
We go back to Walter Reed,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
and a kid, literally,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
20 some-odd days before that

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
was blown up.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
And they shipped him to Germany

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
and 24 hours later they shipped him from Germany

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
to Walter Reed.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
And he was there,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
and they said we needed to come.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
And I went down

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
and they rolled him into a room.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
He's got no legs.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
He's got no arms.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
He's got a small residual limb on one side.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Half of his face is gone,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
but they said his vision is coming back.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
He had one good eye.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
His name is Brandon Marrocco.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
And he said,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
"I need your arms,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
but I need two of them."

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
"You'll get them."

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
This kid was from Staten Island.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
And he said, "I had a truck,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
before I went over there,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
and it had a stick.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
You think I'll be able to drive it?"

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
"Sure."

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
And I turned around and went, "How are we going to do this?"

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000
(Laughter)

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Anyway, he was just like all the rest of them.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
He doesn't really want a lot.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
He wants to help. He told me that

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
he wanted to go back

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
to help his buddies.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
So, I was on my way out here.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000
I was asked to stop at Texas.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
There were 3,500 people,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
the Veteran's Administration,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
U.S. ... just 3,500 at this huge event

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
to help the families

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
of all the kids --

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
some that have died, some that are

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
like Brandon --

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
and they wanted me to speak.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
I said, "What am I going to say?

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
This is not a happy thing. Look, if this happens to you,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
I can give you ... This stuff is

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
still not as good at the original equipment."

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
"You need to come."

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
So, I went.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
And, as I think you get the point,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
there were a lot people there recovering.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Some further along than others.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
But universally, these people that had been through this

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
had astounding attitudes,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000
and just the fact that people care

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
makes a huge difference to them.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
I'll shut up, except one message

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
or concern I have.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
I don't think anybody does it intentionally,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
but there were people there literally talking about,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
"Well, how much will they get?"

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
You know, this country is involved as we've all heard,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
in this great healthcare debate.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
"Who is entitled to what?

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
Who is entitled to how much?

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Who is going to pay for it?"

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Those are tough questions.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
I don't have an answer to that. Not everybody

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
can be entitled to everything simply because you were born here.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
It's not possible. It would be nice

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
but let's be realistic.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
They were tough questions. There's polarized groups down there.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
I don't know the answers.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
There are other questions that are tough.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
"Should we be there?

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
How do we get out?

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
What do we need to do?" There's very polarized

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000
answers to that question too,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.000
and I don't have any answers to that.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Those are political questions, economic questions,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
strategic questions.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
I don't have the answer. But let me give you a simple

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
concern or maybe statement, then.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
It is an easy answer.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
I know what these kids deserve

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
on the healthcare side.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
I was talking to one of them,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
and he was really liking this arm --

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
it's way, way, way better than a plastic

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
stick with a hook on it --

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
but there's nobody in this room that would rather have that

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
than the one you got.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
But I was saying to him, "You know,

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
the first airplane

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
went 100 feet in 1903.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Wilbur and Orville.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
But you know what? It wouldn't have made an old pigeon jealous.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
But now we got Eagles out there,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000
F15s, even that Bald Eagle.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000
I've never seen a bird flying around at Mach 2.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000
I think eventually we'll make these things extraordinary."

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
And I said to that kid,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
"I'll stop when your buddies

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000
are envious of your Luke arm

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
because of what it can do, and how it does it.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
And we'll keep working. And I'm not going to stop working

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
until we do that."

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
And I think this country

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
ought to continue its great debate,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000
whining and complaining, "I'm entitled." "You're a victim."

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
And whining and complaining about what our foreign policy ought to be.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
But while we have the luxury of whining and complaining about

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
who's paying for what and how much we get,

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
the people that are out there

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
giving us that great privilege of whining and complaining,

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
I know what they deserve:

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
everything humanly possible.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
And we ought to give it to them.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:10.000
(Applause)
