00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:03.983
So the first robot
to talk about is called STriDER.

00:00:04.007 --> 00:00:07.476
It stands for Self-excited
Tripedal Dynamic Experimental Robot.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.858
It's a robot that has three legs,
which is inspired by nature.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.911
But have you seen anything in nature,
an animal that has three legs?

00:00:15.935 --> 00:00:19.805
Probably not. So why do I call this
a biologically inspired robot?

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:20.991
How would it work?

00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:23.177
But before that,
let's look at pop culture.

00:00:23.201 --> 00:00:26.669
So, you know H.G. Wells's
"War of the Worlds," novel and movie.

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:30.014
And what you see over here
is a very popular video game,

00:00:30.038 --> 00:00:33.738
and in this fiction, they describe
these alien creatures and robots

00:00:33.762 --> 00:00:36.024
that have three legs that terrorize Earth.

00:00:36.048 --> 00:00:39.583
But my robot, STriDER,
does not move like this.

00:00:39.607 --> 00:00:42.658
This is an actual dynamic
simulation animation.

00:00:42.682 --> 00:00:44.739
I'm going to show you how the robot works.

00:00:44.763 --> 00:00:47.155
It flips its body 180 degrees

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:49.237
and it swings its leg between the two legs

00:00:49.261 --> 00:00:50.420
and catches the fall.

00:00:50.444 --> 00:00:51.606
So that's how it walks.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.342
But when you look at us
human beings, bipedal walking,

00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:55.524
what you're doing is,

00:00:55.548 --> 00:00:59.635
you're not really using muscle
to lift your leg and walk like a robot.

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:02.996
What you're doing is,
you swing your leg and catch the fall,

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.476
stand up again, swing your leg
and catch the fall.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.667
You're using your built-in dynamics,
the physics of your body,

00:01:08.691 --> 00:01:10.442
just like a pendulum.

00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:13.824
We call that the concept
of passive dynamic locomotion.

00:01:13.848 --> 00:01:15.986
What you're doing is, when you stand up,

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.091
potential energy to kinetic energy,

00:01:18.115 --> 00:01:20.092
potential energy to kinetic energy.

00:01:20.116 --> 00:01:22.093
It's a constantly falling process.

00:01:22.117 --> 00:01:25.166
So even though there is nothing
in nature that looks like this,

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.319
really, we're inspired by biology
and applying the principles of walking

00:01:29.343 --> 00:01:30.500
to this robot.

00:01:30.524 --> 00:01:32.501
Thus, it's a biologically inspired robot.

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:34.938
What you see here,
this is what we want to do next.

00:01:34.962 --> 00:01:38.476
We want to fold up the legs
and shoot it up for long-range motion.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.294
And it deploys legs --
it looks almost like "Star Wars" --

00:01:41.318 --> 00:01:44.182
so when it lands, it absorbs
the shock and starts walking.

00:01:44.206 --> 00:01:47.411
What you see over here, this yellow thing,
this is not a death ray.

00:01:47.435 --> 00:01:48.447
(Laughter)

00:01:48.471 --> 00:01:49.630
This is just to show you

00:01:49.654 --> 00:01:52.341
that if you have cameras
or different types of sensors,

00:01:52.365 --> 00:01:53.882
because it's 1.8 meters tall,

00:01:53.906 --> 00:01:56.992
you can see over obstacles like bushes
and those kinds of things.

00:01:57.016 --> 00:01:58.363
So we have two prototypes.

00:01:58.387 --> 00:02:01.330
The first version,
in the back, that's STriDER I.

00:02:01.354 --> 00:02:03.521
The one in front,
the smaller, is STriDER II.

00:02:03.545 --> 00:02:07.053
The problem we had with STriDER I is,
it was just too heavy in the body.

00:02:07.077 --> 00:02:09.661
We had so many motors aligning the joints

00:02:09.685 --> 00:02:10.939
and those kinds of things.

00:02:10.963 --> 00:02:14.163
So we decided to synthesize
a mechanical mechanism

00:02:14.187 --> 00:02:17.256
so we could get rid of all the motors,
and with a single motor,

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.957
we can coordinate all the motions.

00:02:18.981 --> 00:02:22.358
It's a mechanical solution to a problem,
instead of using mechatronics.

00:02:22.382 --> 00:02:25.794
So with this, now the top body
is lighted up; it's walking in our lab.

00:02:25.818 --> 00:02:27.877
This was the very first successful step.

00:02:27.901 --> 00:02:30.569
It's still not perfected,
its coffee falls down,

00:02:30.593 --> 00:02:32.575
so we still have a lot of work to do.

00:02:33.425 --> 00:02:36.121
The second robot I want
to talk about is called IMPASS.

00:02:36.145 --> 00:02:40.604
It stands for Intelligent Mobility
Platform with Actuated Spoke System.

00:02:40.628 --> 00:02:43.223
It's a wheel-leg hybrid robot.

00:02:43.247 --> 00:02:47.104
So think of a rimless wheel
or a spoke wheel,

00:02:47.128 --> 00:02:50.105
but the spokes individually
move in and out of the hub;

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:52.216
so, it's a wheel-leg hybrid.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.482
We're literally reinventing
the wheel here.

00:02:54.506 --> 00:02:56.969
Let me demonstrate how it works.

00:02:56.993 --> 00:03:00.842
So in this video we're using an approach
called the reactive approach.

00:03:00.866 --> 00:03:03.843
Just simply using
the tactile sensors on the feet,

00:03:03.867 --> 00:03:06.677
it's trying to walk
over a changing terrain,

00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:09.401
a soft terrain where it pushes
down and changes.

00:03:09.425 --> 00:03:11.622
And just by the tactile information,

00:03:11.646 --> 00:03:14.401
it successfully crosses
over these types of terrains.

00:03:14.425 --> 00:03:18.230
But, when it encounters
a very extreme terrain --

00:03:18.254 --> 00:03:22.167
in this case, this obstacle
is more than three times the height

00:03:22.191 --> 00:03:23.361
of the robot --

00:03:23.385 --> 00:03:25.259
then it switches to a deliberate mode,

00:03:25.283 --> 00:03:28.097
where it uses a laser range finder
and camera systems

00:03:28.121 --> 00:03:29.947
to identify the obstacle and the size.

00:03:29.971 --> 00:03:32.955
And it carefully plans
the motion of the spokes

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:36.688
and coordinates it so it can show
this very impressive mobility.

00:03:36.712 --> 00:03:39.353
You probably haven't seen
anything like this out there.

00:03:39.377 --> 00:03:43.047
This is a very high-mobility robot
that we developed called IMPASS.

00:03:44.613 --> 00:03:46.401
Ah, isn't that cool?

00:03:46.425 --> 00:03:49.719
When you drive your car,

00:03:49.743 --> 00:03:53.665
when you steer your car, you use
a method called Ackermann steering.

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:55.540
The front wheels rotate like this.

00:03:55.564 --> 00:03:58.079
For most small-wheeled robots,

00:03:58.103 --> 00:04:00.352
they use a method
called differential steering

00:04:00.376 --> 00:04:03.233
where the left and right wheel
turn the opposite direction.

00:04:03.257 --> 00:04:06.155
For IMPASS, we can do many,
many different types of motion.

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:07.448
For example, in this case,

00:04:07.472 --> 00:04:09.872
even though the left and right
wheels are connected

00:04:09.896 --> 00:04:12.662
with a single axle rotating
at the same angle of velocity,

00:04:12.686 --> 00:04:15.820
we simply change the length
of the spoke, it affects the diameter,

00:04:15.844 --> 00:04:17.931
then can turn to the left
and to the right.

00:04:17.955 --> 00:04:21.308
These are just some examples
of the neat things we can do with IMPASS.

00:04:21.332 --> 00:04:23.106
This robot is called CLIMBeR:

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.530
Cable-suspended Limbed Intelligent
Matching Behavior Robot.

00:04:26.554 --> 00:04:29.681
I've been talking
to a lot of NASA JPL scientists --

00:04:29.705 --> 00:04:31.855
at JPL, they are famous
for the Mars rovers --

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:34.250
and the scientists,
geologists always tell me

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:37.401
that the real interesting science,
the science-rich sites,

00:04:37.425 --> 00:04:38.936
are always at the cliffs.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.910
But the current rovers cannot get there.

00:04:40.934 --> 00:04:43.417
So, inspired by that,
we wanted to build a robot

00:04:43.441 --> 00:04:46.558
that can climb
a structured cliff environment.

00:04:46.582 --> 00:04:47.806
So this is CLIMBeR.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.341
It has three legs.

00:04:49.365 --> 00:04:52.948
It's probably difficult to see, but it has
a winch and a cable at the top.

00:04:52.972 --> 00:04:55.553
It tries to figure out
the best place to put its foot.

00:04:55.577 --> 00:04:57.212
And then once it figures that out,

00:04:57.236 --> 00:05:00.213
in real time, it calculates
the force distribution:

00:05:00.237 --> 00:05:02.760
how much force it needs
to exert to the surface

00:05:02.784 --> 00:05:04.761
so it doesn't tip and doesn't slip.

00:05:04.785 --> 00:05:06.926
Once it stabilizes that, it lifts a foot,

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.253
and then with the winch,
it can climb up these kinds of cliffs.

00:05:10.785 --> 00:05:13.401
Also for search and rescue
applications as well.

00:05:13.425 --> 00:05:15.844
Five years ago,
I actually worked at NASA JPL

00:05:15.868 --> 00:05:17.718
during the summer as a faculty fellow.

00:05:17.742 --> 00:05:21.192
And they already had
a six-legged robot called LEMUR.

00:05:21.216 --> 00:05:22.856
So this is actually based on that.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.171
This robot is called MARS:

00:05:24.195 --> 00:05:25.812
Multi-Appendage Robotic System.

00:05:25.836 --> 00:05:27.074
It's a hexapod robot.

00:05:27.098 --> 00:05:29.075
We developed our adaptive gait planner.

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:31.624
We actually have a very interesting
payload on there.

00:05:31.648 --> 00:05:33.095
The students like to have fun.

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:36.214
And here you can see that it's walking
over unstructured terrain.

00:05:36.238 --> 00:05:37.355
(Motor sound)

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:40.176
It's trying to walk
on the coastal terrain, a sandy area,

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.848
but depending on the moisture content
or the grain size of the sand,

00:05:44.872 --> 00:05:48.716
the foot's soil sinkage model changes,
so it tries to adapt its gait

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.980
to successfully cross
over these kind of things.

00:05:51.004 --> 00:05:52.511
It also does some fun stuff.

00:05:52.535 --> 00:05:56.020
As you can imagine,
we get so many visitors visiting our lab.

00:05:56.044 --> 00:05:58.776
So when the visitors come,
MARS walks up to the computer,

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.848
starts typing, "Hello, my name is MARS.

00:06:00.872 --> 00:06:02.401
Welcome to RoMeLa,

00:06:02.425 --> 00:06:05.038
the Robotics Mechanisms
Laboratory at Virginia Tech."

00:06:05.062 --> 00:06:06.532
(Laughter)

00:06:06.556 --> 00:06:08.681
This robot is an amoeba robot.

00:06:08.705 --> 00:06:11.593
Now, we don't have enough time
to go into technical details,

00:06:11.617 --> 00:06:13.674
I'll just show you
some of the experiments.

00:06:13.698 --> 00:06:16.210
These are some of the early
feasibility experiments.

00:06:16.234 --> 00:06:19.319
We store potential energy
to the elastic skin to make it move,

00:06:19.343 --> 00:06:23.146
or use active tension cords
to make it move forward and backward.

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:24.327
It's called ChIMERA.

00:06:24.351 --> 00:06:27.363
We also have been working
with some scientists and engineers

00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:28.538
from UPenn

00:06:28.562 --> 00:06:32.395
to come up with a chemically actuated
version of this amoeba robot.

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:34.302
We do something to something,

00:06:34.326 --> 00:06:36.994
and just like magic, it moves.

00:06:37.626 --> 00:06:39.208
"The Blob."

00:06:39.933 --> 00:06:41.710
This robot is a very recent project.

00:06:41.734 --> 00:06:42.885
It's called RAPHaEL:

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:45.596
Robotic Air-Powered Hand
with Elastic Ligaments.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.619
There are a lot of really neat,
very good robotic hands

00:06:48.643 --> 00:06:49.806
out there on the market.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.010
The problem is,
they're just too expensive --

00:06:52.034 --> 00:06:53.439
tens of thousands of dollars.

00:06:53.463 --> 00:06:56.484
So for prosthesis applications
it's probably not too practical,

00:06:56.508 --> 00:06:57.853
because it's not affordable.

00:06:57.877 --> 00:07:01.351
We wanted to tackle this problem
in a very different direction.

00:07:01.375 --> 00:07:04.424
Instead of using electrical motors,
electromechanical actuators,

00:07:04.448 --> 00:07:06.204
we're using compressed air.

00:07:06.228 --> 00:07:09.675
We developed these novel actuators
for the joints, so it's compliant.

00:07:09.699 --> 00:07:11.401
You can actually change the force,

00:07:11.425 --> 00:07:13.251
simply just changing the air pressure.

00:07:13.275 --> 00:07:15.465
And it can actually crush
an empty soda can.

00:07:15.489 --> 00:07:18.539
It can pick up very delicate
objects like a raw egg,

00:07:18.563 --> 00:07:20.151
or in this case, a lightbulb.

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:24.459
The best part: it took only 200 dollars
to make the first prototype.

00:07:25.906 --> 00:07:28.654
This robot is actually
a family of snake robots

00:07:28.678 --> 00:07:30.046
that we call HyDRAS,

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:32.781
Hyper Degrees-of-freedom Robotic
Articulated Serpentine.

00:07:32.805 --> 00:07:34.976
This is a robot that can climb structures.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.083
This is a HyDRAS's arm.

00:07:37.107 --> 00:07:39.116
It's a 12-degrees-of-freedom robotic arm.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:41.488
But the cool part is the user interface.

00:07:41.512 --> 00:07:44.255
The cable over there,
that's an optical fiber.

00:07:44.279 --> 00:07:46.715
This student, it's probably
her first time using it,

00:07:46.739 --> 00:07:49.096
but she can articulate it
in many different ways.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.583
So, for example, in Iraq, the war zone,
there are roadside bombs.

00:07:52.607 --> 00:07:56.618
Currently, you send these remotely
controlled vehicles that are armed.

00:07:56.642 --> 00:08:00.181
It takes really a lot of time
and it's expensive to train the operator

00:08:00.205 --> 00:08:01.943
to operate this complex arm.

00:08:01.967 --> 00:08:03.934
In this case, it's very intuitive;

00:08:03.958 --> 00:08:06.226
this student, probably
his first time using it,

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:08.228
is doing very complex manipulation tasks,

00:08:08.252 --> 00:08:11.613
picking up objects and doing
manipulation, just like that.

00:08:11.637 --> 00:08:12.842
Very intuitive.

00:08:14.765 --> 00:08:17.362
Now, this robot
is currently our star robot.

00:08:17.386 --> 00:08:20.371
We actually have a fan club
for the robot, DARwIn:

00:08:20.395 --> 00:08:23.296
Dynamic Anthropomorphic
Robot with Intelligence.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.203
As you know, we're very interested
in human walking,

00:08:27.227 --> 00:08:29.419
so we decided to build
a small humanoid robot.

00:08:29.443 --> 00:08:31.205
This was in 2004; at that time,

00:08:31.229 --> 00:08:33.499
this was something really,
really revolutionary.

00:08:33.523 --> 00:08:35.324
This was more of a feasibility study:

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:37.999
What kind of motors should we use?
Is it even possible?

00:08:38.023 --> 00:08:39.757
What kinds of controls should we do?

00:08:39.781 --> 00:08:43.301
This does not have any sensors,
so it's an open-loop control.

00:08:43.325 --> 00:08:46.095
For those who probably know,
if you don't have any sensors

00:08:46.119 --> 00:08:48.692
and there's any disturbances,
you know what happens.

00:08:48.716 --> 00:08:50.829
(Laughter)

00:08:50.853 --> 00:08:56.077
Based on that success, the following year
we did the proper mechanical design,

00:08:56.101 --> 00:08:57.325
starting from kinematics.

00:08:57.349 --> 00:09:00.259
And thus, DARwIn I was born in 2005.

00:09:00.283 --> 00:09:02.594
It stands up, it walks -- very impressive.

00:09:02.618 --> 00:09:05.975
However, still, as you can see,
it has a cord, an umbilical cord.

00:09:05.999 --> 00:09:08.171
So we're still using
an external power source

00:09:08.195 --> 00:09:09.794
and external computation.

00:09:10.742 --> 00:09:14.053
So in 2006, now it's really
time to have fun.

00:09:14.077 --> 00:09:15.536
Let's give it intelligence.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.681
We give it all the computing
power it needs:

00:09:17.705 --> 00:09:20.235
a 1.5 gigahertz Pentium M chip,
two FireWire cameras,

00:09:20.259 --> 00:09:23.105
rate gyros, accelerometers,
four forced sensors on the foot,

00:09:23.129 --> 00:09:24.479
lithium polymer batteries --

00:09:24.503 --> 00:09:27.653
and now DARwIn II
is completely autonomous.

00:09:28.146 --> 00:09:30.837
It is not remote controlled.
There's no tethers.

00:09:30.861 --> 00:09:34.594
It looks around, searches for the ball ...
looks around, searches for the ball,

00:09:34.618 --> 00:09:39.547
and it tries to play a game of soccer
autonomously -- artificial intelligence.

00:09:39.571 --> 00:09:40.725
Let's see how it does.

00:09:40.749 --> 00:09:42.696
This was our very first trial, and ...

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:47.087
(Video) Spectators: Goal!

00:09:48.238 --> 00:09:51.188
Dennis Hong: There is actually
a competition called RoboCup.

00:09:51.212 --> 00:09:53.799
I don't know how many of you
have heard about RoboCup.

00:09:53.823 --> 00:09:58.197
It's an international autonomous
robot soccer competition.

00:09:58.221 --> 00:10:00.969
And the actual goal of RoboCup is,

00:10:00.993 --> 00:10:03.186
by the year 2050,

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:06.941
we want to have full-size,
autonomous humanoid robots

00:10:06.965 --> 00:10:10.039
play soccer against the human
World Cup champions

00:10:10.063 --> 00:10:11.216
and win.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.272
(Laughter)

00:10:12.296 --> 00:10:13.514
It's a true, actual goal.

00:10:13.538 --> 00:10:17.435
It's a very ambitious goal,
but we truly believe we can do it.

00:10:17.459 --> 00:10:19.193
This is last year in China.

00:10:19.217 --> 00:10:22.230
We were the very first team
in the United States that qualified

00:10:22.254 --> 00:10:24.054
in the humanoid RoboCup competition.

00:10:24.078 --> 00:10:26.258
This is this year in Austria.

00:10:26.282 --> 00:10:28.849
You're going to see the action
is three against three,

00:10:28.873 --> 00:10:30.064
completely autonomous.

00:10:30.088 --> 00:10:31.179
(Video) (Crowd groans)

00:10:31.203 --> 00:10:32.533
DH: There you go. Yes!

00:10:33.331 --> 00:10:37.473
The robots track and they team-play
amongst themselves.

00:10:37.934 --> 00:10:39.085
It's very impressive.

00:10:39.109 --> 00:10:40.585
It's really a research event,

00:10:40.609 --> 00:10:44.849
packaged in a more exciting
competition event.

00:10:44.873 --> 00:10:48.401
What you see here is the beautiful
Louis Vuitton Cup trophy.

00:10:48.425 --> 00:10:49.944
This is for the best humanoid.

00:10:49.968 --> 00:10:53.637
We'd like to bring this, for the first
time, to the United States next year,

00:10:53.661 --> 00:10:54.816
so wish us luck.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:55.876
(Applause)

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:57.052
Thank you.

00:10:57.076 --> 00:10:59.157
(Applause)

00:10:59.181 --> 00:11:01.249
DARwIn also has a lot of other talents.

00:11:01.273 --> 00:11:04.989
Last year, it actually conducted
the Roanoke Symphony Orchestra

00:11:05.013 --> 00:11:07.401
for the holiday concert.

00:11:07.425 --> 00:11:10.401
This is the next generation
robot, DARwIn IV,

00:11:10.425 --> 00:11:13.401
much smarter, faster, stronger.

00:11:13.425 --> 00:11:15.402
And it's trying to show off its ability:

00:11:15.426 --> 00:11:17.223
"I'm macho, I'm strong."

00:11:17.247 --> 00:11:18.691
(Laughter)

00:11:18.715 --> 00:11:22.940
"I can also do some Jackie Chan-motion,
martial art movements."

00:11:22.964 --> 00:11:24.976
(Laughter)

00:11:26.425 --> 00:11:28.360
And it walks away. So this is DARwIn IV.

00:11:28.384 --> 00:11:30.519
Again, you'll be able
to see it in the lobby.

00:11:30.543 --> 00:11:33.735
We truly believe this will be
the very first running humanoid robot

00:11:33.759 --> 00:11:34.910
in the United States.

00:11:34.934 --> 00:11:36.088
So stay tuned.

00:11:36.112 --> 00:11:39.113
All right. So I showed you
some of our exciting robots at work.

00:11:39.137 --> 00:11:41.325
So, what is the secret of our success?

00:11:41.349 --> 00:11:43.166
Where do we come up with these ideas?

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:45.083
How do we develop these kinds of ideas?

00:11:45.107 --> 00:11:46.897
We have a fully autonomous vehicle

00:11:46.921 --> 00:11:48.797
that can drive into urban environments.

00:11:48.821 --> 00:11:51.720
We won a half a million dollars
in the DARPA Urban Challenge.

00:11:51.744 --> 00:11:55.401
We also have the world's very first
vehicle that can be driven by the blind.

00:11:55.425 --> 00:11:57.949
We call it the Blind Driver
Challenge, very exciting.

00:11:57.973 --> 00:12:01.145
And many, many other robotics
projects I want to talk about.

00:12:01.169 --> 00:12:03.806
These are just the awards
that we won in 2007 fall

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:06.401
from robotics competitions
and those kinds of things.

00:12:06.425 --> 00:12:08.318
So really, we have five secrets.

00:12:08.342 --> 00:12:10.778
First is: Where do we get inspiration?

00:12:10.802 --> 00:12:12.881
Where do we get this spark of imagination?

00:12:12.905 --> 00:12:14.926
This is a true story, my personal story.

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:17.727
At night, when I go to bed,
at three, four in the morning,

00:12:17.751 --> 00:12:20.640
I lie down, close my eyes,
and I see these lines and circles

00:12:20.664 --> 00:12:22.458
and different shapes floating around.

00:12:22.482 --> 00:12:25.245
And they assemble, and they form
these kinds of mechanisms.

00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:26.877
And I think, "Ah, this is cool."

00:12:26.901 --> 00:12:29.778
So right next to my bed
I keep a notebook, a journal,

00:12:29.802 --> 00:12:32.158
with a special pen
that has an LED light on it,

00:12:32.182 --> 00:12:35.219
because I don't want to turn on the light
and wake up my wife.

00:12:35.243 --> 00:12:38.512
So I see this, scribble everything down,
draw things, and go to bed.

00:12:38.536 --> 00:12:40.926
Every day in the morning,
the first thing I do,

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:43.557
before my first cup of coffee,
before I brush my teeth,

00:12:43.581 --> 00:12:44.743
I open my notebook.

00:12:44.767 --> 00:12:47.430
Many times it's empty;
sometimes I have something there.

00:12:47.454 --> 00:12:49.520
If something's there, sometimes it's junk.

00:12:49.544 --> 00:12:51.901
But most of the time,
I can't read my handwriting.

00:12:51.925 --> 00:12:54.249
Four in the morning --
what do you expect, right?

00:12:54.273 --> 00:12:56.177
So I need to decipher what I wrote.

00:12:56.201 --> 00:12:59.401
But sometimes I see
this ingenious idea in there,

00:12:59.425 --> 00:13:00.910
and I have this eureka moment.

00:13:00.934 --> 00:13:03.450
I directly run to my home office,
sit at my computer,

00:13:03.474 --> 00:13:05.451
I type in the ideas, I sketch things out

00:13:05.475 --> 00:13:07.366
and I keep a database of ideas.

00:13:08.028 --> 00:13:10.389
So when we have these calls for proposals,

00:13:10.413 --> 00:13:13.983
I try to find a match
between my potential ideas

00:13:14.007 --> 00:13:15.167
and the problem.

00:13:15.191 --> 00:13:17.508
If there's a match,
we write a research proposal,

00:13:17.532 --> 00:13:18.879
get the research funding in,

00:13:18.903 --> 00:13:21.063
and that's how we start
our research programs.

00:13:21.087 --> 00:13:23.580
But just a spark of imagination
is not good enough.

00:13:23.604 --> 00:13:25.484
How do we develop these kinds of ideas?

00:13:25.508 --> 00:13:28.288
At our lab RoMeLa, the Robotics
and Mechanisms Laboratory,

00:13:28.312 --> 00:13:30.924
we have these fantastic
brainstorming sessions.

00:13:30.948 --> 00:13:35.283
So we gather around, we discuss problems
and solutions and talk about it.

00:13:35.307 --> 00:13:38.284
But before we start,
we set this golden rule.

00:13:38.308 --> 00:13:39.957
The rule is:

00:13:39.981 --> 00:13:42.958
nobody criticizes anybody's ideas.

00:13:42.982 --> 00:13:44.987
Nobody criticizes any opinion.

00:13:45.425 --> 00:13:48.972
This is important, because many times,
students fear or feel uncomfortable

00:13:48.996 --> 00:13:52.265
about how others might think
about their opinions and thoughts.

00:13:52.289 --> 00:13:56.079
So once you do this, it is amazing
how the students open up.

00:13:56.103 --> 00:13:59.401
They have these wacky, cool,
crazy, brilliant ideas,

00:13:59.425 --> 00:14:02.854
and the whole room is just electrified
with creative energy.

00:14:02.878 --> 00:14:05.151
And this is how we develop our ideas.

00:14:05.738 --> 00:14:07.295
Well, we're running out of time.

00:14:07.319 --> 00:14:09.221
One more thing I want to talk about is,

00:14:09.245 --> 00:14:12.401
you know, just a spark of idea
and development is not good enough.

00:14:12.425 --> 00:14:17.136
There was a great TED moment --
I think it was Sir Ken Robinson, was it?

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:21.598
He gave a talk about how education
and school kill creativity.

00:14:21.622 --> 00:14:24.401
Well, actually,
there's two sides to the story.

00:14:24.425 --> 00:14:29.638
So there is only so much one can do
with just ingenious ideas

00:14:29.662 --> 00:14:32.678
and creativity
and good engineering intuition.

00:14:32.702 --> 00:14:34.496
If you want to go beyond a tinkering,

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.670
if you want to go
beyond a hobby of robotics

00:14:36.694 --> 00:14:40.135
and really tackle
the grand challenges of robotics

00:14:40.159 --> 00:14:41.401
through rigorous research,

00:14:41.425 --> 00:14:42.580
we need more than that.

00:14:42.604 --> 00:14:44.618
This is where school comes in.

00:14:44.642 --> 00:14:47.136
Batman, fighting against the bad guys,

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:49.553
he has his utility belt,
he has his grappling hook,

00:14:49.577 --> 00:14:51.401
he has all different kinds of gadgets.

00:14:51.425 --> 00:14:53.838
For us roboticists,
engineers and scientists,

00:14:53.862 --> 00:14:58.019
these tools are the courses
and classes you take in class.

00:14:58.043 --> 00:15:00.045
Math, differential equations.

00:15:00.069 --> 00:15:02.809
I have linear algebra, science, physics --

00:15:02.833 --> 00:15:05.801
even, nowadays, chemistry
and biology, as you've seen.

00:15:05.825 --> 00:15:07.583
These are all the tools we need.

00:15:07.607 --> 00:15:09.483
So the more tools you have, for Batman,

00:15:09.507 --> 00:15:11.484
more effective at fighting the bad guys,

00:15:11.508 --> 00:15:14.414
for us, more tools to attack
these kinds of big problems.

00:15:15.582 --> 00:15:17.447
So education is very important.

00:15:18.568 --> 00:15:21.165
Also -- it's not only about that.

00:15:21.189 --> 00:15:23.257
You also have to work really, really hard.

00:15:23.281 --> 00:15:24.734
So I always tell my students,

00:15:24.758 --> 00:15:26.809
"Work smart, then work hard."

00:15:26.833 --> 00:15:29.557
This picture in the back --
this is three in the morning.

00:15:29.581 --> 00:15:31.910
I guarantee if you come
to our lab at 3, 4am,

00:15:31.934 --> 00:15:33.490
we have students working there,

00:15:33.514 --> 00:15:36.723
not because I tell them to,
but because we are having too much fun.

00:15:36.747 --> 00:15:38.401
Which leads to the last topic:

00:15:38.425 --> 00:15:40.294
do not forget to have fun.

00:15:40.318 --> 00:15:43.531
That's really the secret of our success,
we're having too much fun.

00:15:43.555 --> 00:15:47.021
I truly believe that highest productivity
comes when you're having fun,

00:15:47.045 --> 00:15:48.401
and that's what we're doing.

00:15:48.425 --> 00:15:49.579
And there you go.

00:15:49.603 --> 00:15:50.770
Thank you so much.

00:15:50.794 --> 00:15:54.896
(Applause)
