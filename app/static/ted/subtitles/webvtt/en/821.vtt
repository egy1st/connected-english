00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Thank you. I have two missions here today.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
The first is to tell you something about pollen, I hope,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and to convince you that it's more than just something that gets up your nose.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And, secondly, to convince you

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
that every home really ought to have a scanning electron microscope.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
(Laughter)

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Pollen is a flower's way of making more flowers.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It carries male sex cells

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
from one flower to another.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This gives us genetic diversity,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
or at least it gives the plants genetic diversity.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And it's really rather better not to mate with yourself.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
That's probably true of humans as well, mostly.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Pollen is produced by the anthers of flowers.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Each anther can carry up to 100,000 grains of pollen,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
so, it's quite prolific stuff.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And it isn't just bright flowers

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
that have pollen; it's also trees and grasses.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And remember that all our cereal crops are grasses as well.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Here is a scanning electron micrograph of a grain of pollen.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
The little hole in the middle, we'll come to a bit later,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
but that's for the pollen tube

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
to come out later on. A very tiny tube.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
So, that's 20 micrometers across,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
that pollen grain there.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
That's about a 50th of a millimeter.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
But not all pollen is quite so simple looking.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
This is Morina. This is a plant --

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
which I've always thought to be rather tedious --

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
named after Morin,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
who was an enterprising French gardener,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
who issued the first seed catalog

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
in 1621.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
But anyway, take a look at its pollen.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
This is amazing, I think.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
That little hole in the middle there is for the pollen tube,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and when the pollen finds its special female spot

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
in another Morina flower,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
just on the right species, what happens?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Like I said, pollen carries the male sex cells.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
If you actually didn't realize that plants have sex,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
they have rampant, promiscuous

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and really quite interesting and curious sex. Really.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
(Laughter) A lot.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
My story is actually not about plant propagation,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
but about pollen itself.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
"So, what are pollen's properties?" I hear you ask.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
First of all, pollen is tiny. Yes we know that.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
It's also very biologically active,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
as anyone with hay fever will understand.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Now, pollen from plants, which are wind-dispersed --

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
like trees and grasses and so on --

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
tend to cause the most hay fever.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And the reason for that is they've got to chuck out

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
masses and masses of pollen to have any chance

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
of the pollen reaching another plant of the same species.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Here are some examples --

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
they're very smooth if you look at them --

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
of tree pollen that is meant to be carried by the wind.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Again -- this time, sycamore -- wind-dispersed.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
So, trees: very boring flowers,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
not really trying to attract insects.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Cool pollen, though.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
This one I particularly like.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
This is the Monterey Pine, which has little air sacks

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
to make the pollen carry even further.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Remember, that thing is just about 30 micrometers across.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Now, it's much more efficient if you can get insects to do your bidding.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
This is a bee's leg

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
with the pollen glommed onto it from a mallow plant.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And this is the outrageous and beautiful

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
flower of the mangrove palm.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Very showy, to attract lots of insects to do its bidding.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
The pollen has little barbs on it,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
if we look.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Now, those little barbs

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
obviously stick to the insects well,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
but there is something else that we can tell from this photograph,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and that is that you might be able to see a fracture line

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
across what would be the equator of this, if it was the Earth.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
That tells me that it's actually been fossilized, this pollen.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
And I'm rather proud to say

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
that this was found just near London, and that 55 million years ago

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
London was full of mangroves.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Isn't that cool?

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
(Laughter)

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Okay, so this is another species evolved to be dispersed by insects.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
You can tell that from the little barbs on there.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
All these pictures were taken with a scanning electron microscope,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
actually in the lab at Kew Laboratories.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
No coincidence that these were taken

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
by Rob Kesseler, who is an artist,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and I think it's someone with a design and artistic eye

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
like him that has managed to bring out the best in pollen.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
(Laughter)

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Now, all this diversity

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
means that you can look at a pollen grain

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
and tell what species it came from,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
and that's actually quite handy if you

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
maybe have a sample and you want to see where it came from.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
So, different species of plants

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
grow in different places,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and some pollen carries further than others.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
So, if you have a pollen sample,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
then in principle, you should be able to tell

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
where that sample came from.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
And this is where it gets interesting for forensics.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Pollen is tiny. It gets on to things, and it sticks to them.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
So, not only does each type of pollen look different,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
but each habitat has a different combination of plants.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
A different pollen signature, if you like,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
or a different pollen fingerprint.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
By looking at the proportions and combinations

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
of different kinds of pollen in a sample,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
you can tell very precisely where it came from.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
This is some pollen embedded in a cotton shirt,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
similar to the one that I'm wearing now.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Now, much of the pollen will still be there

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
after repeated washings.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Where has it been?

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Four very different habitats might look similar,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
but they've got very different pollen signatures.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Actually this one is particularly easy, these pictures were all taken

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
in different countries.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
But pollen forensics can be very subtle.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
It's being used now to track

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
where counterfeit drugs have been made,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
where banknotes have come from,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
to look at the provenance of antiques

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
and see that they really did come from the place

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
the seller said they did.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
And murder suspects have been tracked

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
using their clothing,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
certainly in the U.K., to within an area

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
that's small enough that you can send in tracker dogs

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
to find the murder victim.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
So, you can tell from a piece of clothing

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
to within about a kilometer or so,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
where that piece of clothing has been recently

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
and then send in dogs.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And finally, in a rather grizzly way,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
the Bosnia war crimes;

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
some of the people brought to trial were brought to trial

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
because of the evidence from pollen,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
which showed that bodies had been buried,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
exhumed and then reburied somewhere else.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
I hope I've opened your eyes,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
if you'll excuse the visual pun, (Laughter)

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
to some of pollen's secrets.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
This is a horse chestnut.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
There is an invisible beauty all around us,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
each grain with a story to tell ...

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
each of us, in fact, with a story to tell

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
from the pollen fingerprint that's upon us.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Thank you to the colleagues at Kew,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
and thank you to palynologists everywhere.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
(Applause)
