00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
(Music)

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
♫ My age is three hundred ♫

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
♫ and seventy-two ♫

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
♫ I think with the deepest regret ♫

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
♫ How I used to pick up

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and voraciously chew ♫

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
♫ the dear little boys

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
that I met ♫

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
♫ I've eaten them raw

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
in their holiday suits, ♫

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
♫ Eaten them

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
curried with rice, ♫

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
♫ I've eaten them baked

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
in their jackets and boots, ♫

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
♫ And found them exceedingly nice. ♫

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
♫ But now that my jaws

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
are too weak for such fare, ♫

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
♫ I think it's increasingly rude ♫

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
♫ To do such a thing

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
when I'm quite well aware ♫

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
♫ Little boys do not like

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
being chewed. ♫

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
♫ Little boys do not like

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
being chewed. ♫

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
(Music)

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
♫ So now I contentedly live upon eels, ♫

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
♫ And try to do nothing amiss ♫

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
♫ And pass all the time

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I can spare from my meals ♫

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
♫ In innocent slumber like this, ♫

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
♫ Innocent slumber

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
like this. ♫

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:38.000
(Applause)

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I suppose I owe you an explanation.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
I've been working on a project for the last six years

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
adapting children's poetry to music.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And that's a poem by Charles Edward Carryl,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
who was a stockbroker in New York City

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
for 45 years,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
but in the evenings, he wrote nonsense for his children.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And this book was one of the most famous books in America

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
for about 35 years.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
"The Sleepy Giant," which is the song that I just sang,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
is one of his poems.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Now, we're going to do

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
other poems for you,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and here's a preview of some of the poets.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
This is Rachel Field,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Robert Graves --

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
a very young Robert Graves --

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Christina Rossetti.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Ghosts, right?

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Have nothing to say to us,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
obsolete,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
gone --

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
not so.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
What I really enjoyed about this project

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
is reviving these people's words.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Taking them off the dead, flat pages.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Bringing them to life,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
bringing them to light.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
So, what we're going to do next

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
is a poem that was written by Nathalia Crane.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Nathalia Crane was a little girl from Brooklyn.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
When she was 10 years old in 1927,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
she published her first book of poems

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
called "The Janitor's Boy."

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Here she is.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And here's her poem.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
(Music)

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
♫ Oh, I'm in love

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
with the janitor's boy, ♫

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
♫ And the janitor's boy

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
is in love with me. ♫

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
♫ Oh, I'm in love

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
with the janitor's boy, ♫

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
♫ And the janitor's boy

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
is in love with me. ♫

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
♫ He's going to hunt for a desert isle ♫

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
♫ In our geography. ♫

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
♫ A desert isle

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
with spicy trees ♫

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
♫ Somewhere in Sheepshead Bay; ♫

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
♫ A right nice place,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
just fit for two ♫

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
♫ Where we can live always. ♫

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
♫ Oh, I'm in love

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
with the janitor's boy, ♫

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
♫ And the janitor's boy, ♫

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
he's busy as can be; ♫

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
♫ Down in the cellar he's making a raft ♫

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
♫ Out of an old settee. ♫

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
♫ He'll carry me off,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
I know that he will, ♫

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
♫ For his hair is exceedingly red; ♫

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
♫ And the only thing

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
that occurs to me ♫

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
♫ Is to dutifully shiver in bed. ♫

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
♫ And on the day that we sail,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
I will leave a little note ♫

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
♫ For my parents I hate to annoy: ♫

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
♫ "I have flown to an island

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
in the bay ♫

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
♫ With my janitor's

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
red haired-boy." ♫

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
♫ I'm going to sail away ♫

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
♫ Gone to Sheepshead Bay ♫

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
♫ With my janitor's red-haired boy. ♫

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
♫ On an old settee ♫

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
♫ My red-haired boy and me ♫

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
♫ The janitor's red-haired boy. ♫

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:22.000
(Applause)

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
The next poem is by E.E. Cummings,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
"Maggie and Milly and Molly and May."

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
(Music)

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
♫ Maggie and Milly,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Molly and May ♫

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
♫ They went down to the beach

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
one day to play ♫

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
♫ And Maggie discovered

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
a shell that sang ♫

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
♫ So sweetly she couldn't remember

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
her troubles ♫

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
♫ Maggie and Milly,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Molly and May ♫

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
♫ Maggie and Milly,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Molly and May ♫

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
♫ Milly befriended

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
a stranded star ♫

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
♫ Whose rays,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
whose rays ♫

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
♫ Five languid fingers

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
were ♫

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
(Music)

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
♫ Maggie and Milly,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Molly and May ♫

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
♫ Maggie and Milly,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Molly and May ♫

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
(Music)

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
♫ Molly was chased

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
by a horrible thing ♫

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
♫ Which raced

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
sideways blowing ♫

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
♫ Blowing ♫

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
♫ Blowing ♫

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
♫ May came home

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
with a smooth, round stone ♫

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
♫ Small as a world

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
and as large as alone ♫

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
(Music)

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
♫ For whatever we lose

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
like a you or a me ♫

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
♫ Always ourselves

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
that we find

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
at the sea ♫

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
(Applause)

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Thank you.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:18.000
(Applause)

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
The next poem is "If No One Ever Marries Me."

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
It was written by Laurence Alma-Tadema.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
She was the daughter of a very, very famous Dutch painter

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
who had made his fame in England.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
He went there after the death

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
of his wife of smallpox

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
and brought his two young children.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
One was his daughter, Laurence.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
She wrote this poem when she was

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
18 years old in 1888,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
and I look at it as kind of a

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
very sweet feminist manifesto

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
tinged with a little bit of defiance

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
and a little bit of resignation and regret.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.000
(Music)

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000
♫ Well, if no one ever marries me ♫

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
♫ And I don't see why they should, ♫

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
♫ Nurse says I'm not pretty, ♫

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
♫ And you know I'm seldom good,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
seldom good -- ♫

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
♫ Well, if no one ever marries me ♫

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
♫ I shan't mind very much; ♫

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
♫ Buy a squirrel in a cage ♫

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
♫ And a little rabbit-hutch. ♫

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
♫ If no one marries me ♫

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
♫ If no one marries me ♫

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
♫ If no one marries me ♫

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
♫ If no one marries me ♫

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
♫ If no one marries me ♫

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
♫ I'll have a cottage near a wood ♫

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
♫ And a pony all my own ♫

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
♫ A little lamb quite clean and tame ♫

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
♫ That I can take to town. ♫

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
♫ And when I'm really getting old -- ♫

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
♫ And 28 or nine -- ♫

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
♫ Buy myself a little orphan girl ♫

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
♫ And bring her up as mine. ♫

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
♫ If no one marries me ♫

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
♫ If no one marries me ♫

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
♫ If no one marries me ♫

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
♫ If no one marries me ♫

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
♫ Well, if no one marries me ♫

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
♫ Marries me ♫

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
♫ Well, if no one marries me ♫

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
♫ Marries me ♫

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
♫ Well, if no one marries me ♫

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Thank you.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:37.000
(Applause) Thank you.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
I became very curious about the poets

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
after spending six years with them,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
and started to research their lives,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
and then decided to write a book about it.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
And the burning question about Alma-Tadema

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
was: Did she marry?

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
And the answer was no,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
which I found in the London Times archive.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
She died alone in 1940

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
in the company of her books and her dear friends.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Gerard Manley Hopkins,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
a saintly man.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
He became a Jesuit.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
He converted from his Anglican faith.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
He was moved to by the Tractarian Movement,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
the Oxford Movement, otherwise known as --

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
and he became a Jesuit priest.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
He burned all his poetry at the age of 24

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
and then did not write another poem for at least seven years

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
because he couldn't rectify the life of a poet

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
with the life of a priest.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
He died typhoid fever

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
at the age of 44, I believe,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
43 or 44.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
At the time, he was teaching classics

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
at Trinity College in Dublin.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
A few years before he died,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
after he had resumed writing poetry,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
but in secret,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
he confessed to a friend in a letter

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
that I found when I was doing my research:

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
"I've written a verse.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
It is to explain death to a child,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
and it deserves a piece of plain-song music."

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
And my blood froze when I read that

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
because I had written the plain-song music

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
130 years after he'd written the letter.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
And the poem is called, "Spring and Fall."

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
♫ Margaret,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
are you grieving ♫

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
♫ Over Goldengrove

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
unleaving, by and by? ♫

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
♫ But as the heart grows older ♫

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
♫ It will come to such sights

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
much colder ♫

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
♫ By and by,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
♫ And yet you will weep

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
and you'll know why. ♫

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000
♫ No matter child, the name: ♫

♫ Sorrow's springs are all the same ♫

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
♫ They're all the same. ♫

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
♫ Nor mouth had

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
nor no mind expressed ♫

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000
♫ What heart heard of,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
ghost had guessed: ♫

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
♫ It's the blight

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000
man was born for, ♫

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
♫ It is Margaret

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
that you mourn for ♫

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
Thank you so much.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
everyone that blew my mind this week.

Calming the audience down;

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
I'm supposed to be whipping you into a frenzy, and I,

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.000
