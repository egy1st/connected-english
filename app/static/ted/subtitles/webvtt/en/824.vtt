00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's pretend right here we have a machine.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
A big machine, a cool, TED-ish machine,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and it's a time machine.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And everyone in this room has to get into it.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And you can go backwards, you can go forwards;

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
you cannot stay where you are.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And I wonder what you'd choose, because I've been asking my friends

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
this question a lot lately and they all want to go back.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I don't know. They want to go back before there were automobiles

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
or Twitter or "American Idol."

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I don't know.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I'm convinced that there's some sort of pull

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
to nostalgia, to wishful thinking.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And I understand that.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I'm not part of that crowd, I have to say.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I don't want to go back, and it's not because I'm adventurous.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It's because possibilities on this planet,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
they don't go back, they go forward.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So I want to get in the machine, and I want to go forward.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
This is the greatest time there's ever been on this planet

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
by any measure that you wish to choose:

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
health, wealth,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
mobility, opportunity,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
declining rates of disease ...

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
There's never been a time like this.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
My great-grandparents died, all of them,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
by the time they were 60.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
My grandparents pushed that number to 70.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
My parents are closing in on 80.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So there better be

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
a nine at the beginning of my death number.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
But it's not even about people like us,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
because this is a bigger deal than that.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
A kid born in New Delhi today

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
can expect to live as long as

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
the richest man in the world did 100 years ago.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Think about that, it's an incredible fact.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And why is it true?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Smallpox. Smallpox killed billions

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
of people on this planet.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
It reshaped the demography of the globe

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
in a way that no war ever has.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
It's gone. It's vanished.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
We vanquished it. Puff.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
In the rich world,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
no longer exist, hardly.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Diphtheria, rubella, polio ...

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
does anyone even know what those things are?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Vaccines, modern medicine,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
our ability to feed billions of people,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
those are triumphs of the scientific method.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And to my mind, the scientific method --

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
trying stuff out,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
seeing if it works, changing it when it doesn't --

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
is one of the great accomplishments of humanity.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
So that's the good news.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Unfortunately, that's all the good news

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
because there are some other problems, and they've been mentioned many times.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And one of them is that

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
despite all our accomplishments,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
a billion people go to bed hungry

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
in this world every day.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
That number's rising, and it's rising really rapidly, and it's disgraceful.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And not only that, we've used our imagination

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
to thoroughly trash this globe.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Potable water, arable land,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
rainforests, oil, gas:

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
they're going away, and they're going away soon,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and unless we innovate our way out of this mess,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
we're going away too.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
So the question is: Can we do that? And I think we can.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I think it's clear that we can make food

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
that will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
I think we can power this world with energy

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
that doesn't also destroy it.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I really do believe that, and, no, it ain't wishful thinking.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
But here's the thing that keeps me up at night --

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
one of the things that keeps me up at night:

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
We've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now. Never.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
And we've also never been in a position

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
to deploy it properly in the way that we can today.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
We're on the verge of amazing, amazing events

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
in many fields,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and yet I actually think we'd have to go back

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
hundreds, 300 years, before the Enlightenment,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
to find a time when we battled progress,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
when we fought about these things

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
more vigorously, on more fronts, than we do now.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
People wrap themselves in their beliefs,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
and they do it so tightly that you can't set them free.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Not even the truth will set them free.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And, listen, everyone's entitled to their opinion;

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
they're even entitled to their opinion about progress.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
But you know what you're not entitled to?

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
You're not entitled to your own facts. Sorry, you're not.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And this took me awhile to figure out.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
About a decade ago, I wrote a story about vaccines

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
for The New Yorker. A little story.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
And I was amazed to find opposition:

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
opposition to what is, after all,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
the most effective public health measure in human history.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
I didn't know what to do,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
so I just did what I do: I wrote a story and I moved on.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And soon after that,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
I wrote a story about genetically engineered food.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Same thing, only bigger.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
People were going crazy.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
So I wrote a story about that too,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
and I couldn't understand why

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
people thought this was "Frankenfoods,"

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
why they thought moving molecules around

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
in a specific, rather than a haphazard way,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
was trespassing on nature's ground.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
But, you know, I do what I do. I wrote the story, I moved on.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
I mean, I'm a journalist.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
We type, we file, we go to dinner. It's fine.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
(Laughter)

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
But these stories bothered me,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
and I couldn't figure out why, and eventually I did.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
And that's because those fanatics that were driving me crazy

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
weren't actually fanatics at all.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
They were thoughtful people, educated people, decent people.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
They were exactly like the people in this room.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
And it just disturbed me so much.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
But then I thought, you know, let's be honest.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
We're at a point in this world

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
where we don't have the same relationship to progress that we used to.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
We talk about it ambivalently.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
We talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it:

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
"progress."

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Okay, there are reasons for that, and I think we know what those reasons are.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
We've lost faith in institutions,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
in authority,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
and sometimes in science itself,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
and there's no reason we shouldn't have.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
You can just say a few names

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
and people will understand.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Chernobyl, Bhopal, the Challenger,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Vioxx, weapons of mass destruction,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
hanging chads.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
You know, you can choose your list.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
There are questions and problems

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
with the people we used to believe were always right,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
so be skeptical.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Ask questions, demand proof, demand evidence.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Don't take anything for granted.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
But here's the thing: When you get proof,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
you need to accept the proof, and we're not that good at doing that.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And the reason that I can say that is because

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
we're now in an epidemic of fear

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
like one I've never seen and hope never to see again.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
About 12 years ago, there was a story published,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
a horrible story,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
that linked the epidemic of autism

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
to the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine shot.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Very scary.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Tons of studies were done to see if this was true.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Tons of studies should have been done; it's a serious issue.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
The data came back.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
The data came back from the United States, from England,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
from Sweden, from Canada,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
and it was all the same: no correlation,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
no connection, none at all.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
because we believe anecdotes,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
we believe what we see, what we think we see,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
what makes us feel real.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
We don't believe a bunch of documents

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
from a government official giving us data,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and I do understand that, I think we all do.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
But you know what?

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
The result of that has been disastrous.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Disastrous because here's a fact:

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
The United States is one of the only countries in the world

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
where the vaccine rate for measles is going down.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
That is disgraceful,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
and we should be ashamed of ourselves.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
It's horrible.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
What kind of a thing happened

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
that we could do that?

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Now, I understand it. I do understand it.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Because, did anyone have measles here?

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Has one person in this audience ever seen someone die of measles?

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Doesn't happen very much.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Doesn't happen in this country at all,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
but it happened 160,000 times in the world last year.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
That's a lot of death of measles --

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
20 an hour.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
But since it didn't happen here, we can put it out of our minds,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
and people like Jenny McCarthy

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
can go around preaching messages

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
of fear and illiteracy from platforms

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
like "Oprah" and "Larry King Live."

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
And they can do it because

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
they don't link causation and correlation.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
They don't understand that these things seem the same,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
but they're almost never the same.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And it's something we need to learn, and we need to learn it really soon.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
This guy was a hero, Jonas Salk.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
He took one of the worst scourges of mankind away from us.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
No fear, no agony. Polio -- puff, gone.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
That guy in the middle, not so much.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
His name is Paul Offit.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
He just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a bunch of other people.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
It'll save the lives of 400 to 500,000 kids

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
in the developing world every year.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Pretty good, right?

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Well, it's good, except that Paul goes around talking about vaccines

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
and says how valuable they are

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
and that people ought to just stop the whining.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
And he actually says it that way.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
So, Paul's a terrorist.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
When Paul speaks in a public hearing,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
he can't testify without armed guards.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
He gets called at home

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
because people like to tell him

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
that they remember where his kids go to school.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
And why? Because Paul made a vaccine.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
I don't need to say this, but vaccines are essential.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
You take them away, disease comes back,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
horrible diseases. And that's happening.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
We have measles in this country now.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
And it's getting worse, and pretty soon kids

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
are going to die of it again because it's just a numbers game.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
And they're not just going to die of measles.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
What about polio? Let's have that. Why not?

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
A college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
she thought I was a little strident.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
No one's ever said that before.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
She wasn't going to vaccinate her kid against polio,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
no way.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Fine.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Why? Because we don't have polio. And you know what?

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
We didn't have polio in this country yesterday.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Today, I don't know, maybe a guy got on a plane in Lagos this morning,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
and he's flying to LAX, right now he's over Ohio.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
And he's going to land in a couple of hours, he's going to rent a car,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
and he's going to come to Long Beach,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
and he's going to attend one of these fabulous TED dinners tonight.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
And he doesn't know that he's infected with a paralytic disease,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
and we don't either because that's the way the world works.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
That's the planet we live on. Don't pretend it isn't.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Now, we love to wrap ourselves in lies. We love to do it.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Everyone take their vitamins this morning?

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Echinacea, a little antioxidant

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
to get you going.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
I know you did because half of Americans do every day.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
They take the stuff, and they take alternative medicines,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
and it doesn't matter how often

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
we find out that they're useless.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
The data says it all the time.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
They darken your urine. They almost never do more than that.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
(Laughter)

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
It's okay, you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine?

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
I'm totally with you.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
(Laughter)

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Dark urine. Dark.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Why do we do that? Why do we do that?

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Well, I think I understand, we hate Big Pharma.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
We hate Big Government. We don't trust the Man.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
And we shouldn't: Our health care system sucks.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
It's cruel to millions of people.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
It's absolutely astonishingly cold

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
and soul-bending to those of us who can even afford it.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
So we run away from it, and where do we run?

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
We leap into the arms of Big Placebo.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
(Laughter)

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
That's fantastic. I love Big Placebo.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
(Applause)

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
But, you know, it's really a serious thing

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
because this stuff is crap,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
and we spend billions of dollars on it.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
And I have all sorts of little props here.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
None of it ... ginkgo, fraud;

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
echinacea, fraud;

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
acai -- I don't even know what that is

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
but we're spending billions of dollars on it -- it's fraud.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
And you know what? When I say this stuff, people scream at me,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
and they say, "What do you care? Let people do what they want to do.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
It makes them feel good."

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
And you know what? You're wrong.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Because I don't care

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
if it's the secretary of HHS

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
who's saying, "Hmm, I'm not going to take the evidence

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
of my experts on mammograms,"

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
or some cancer quack who wants to treat his patient

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
with coffee enemas.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
When you start down the road

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
where belief and magic replace evidence and science,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
you end up in a place you don't want to be.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
You end up in Thabo Mbeki South Africa.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
He killed 400,000 of his people

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
by insisting that beetroot,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
garlic and lemon oil

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
were much more effective than the antiretroviral drugs

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
we know can slow the course of AIDS.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Hundreds of thousands of needless deaths

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
in a country that has been plagued

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
worse than any other by this disease.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Please, don't tell me

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
there are no consequences to these things.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
There are. There always are.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Now, the most mindless epidemic

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
we're in the middle of right now

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
is this absurd battle

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
between proponents of genetically engineered food

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
and the organic elite.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
It's an idiotic debate. It has to stop.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
It's a debate about words, about metaphors.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
It's ideology, it's not science.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Every single thing we eat, every grain of rice,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
every sprig of parsley,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
every Brussels sprout

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
has been modified by man.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
You know, there weren't tangerines in the garden of Eden.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
There wasn't any cantaloupe. (Laughter)

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
There weren't Christmas trees. We made it all.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
We made it over the last 11,000 years.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
And some of it worked, and some of it didn't.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
We got rid of the stuff that didn't.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Now we can do it in a more precise way --

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
and there are risks, absolutely --

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
but we can put something like vitamin A into rice,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
and that stuff can help millions of people,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
millions of people, prolong their lives.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
You don't want to do that?

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
I have to say, I don't understand it.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
We object to genetically engineered food.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Why do we do that?

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Well, the things I constantly hear are:

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Too many chemicals,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
pesticides, hormones,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
monoculture, we don't want giant fields

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
of the same thing, that's wrong.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
We don't companies patenting life.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
We don't want companies owning seeds.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
And you know what my response to all of that is?

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Yes, you're right. Let's fix it.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
It's true, we've got a huge food problem,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
but this isn't science.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
This has nothing to do with science.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
It's law, it's morality, it's patent stuff.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
You know science isn't a company.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
It's not a country.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
It's not even an idea; it's a process.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
It's a process, and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
but the idea that we should not allow

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
science to do its job

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
because we're afraid,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
is really very deadening,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
and it's preventing millions of people

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
from prospering.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
You know, in the next 50 years

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
we're going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we do right now,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
70 percent.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
This investment in Africa over the last 30 years.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Disgraceful. Disgraceful.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
They need it, and we're not giving it to them.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
And why? Genetically engineered food.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
We don't want to encourage people

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
to eat that rotten stuff, like cassava for instance.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Cassava's something that half a billion people eat.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
It's kind of like a potato.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
It's just a bunch of calories. It sucks.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
It doesn't have nutrients, it doesn't have protein,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
and scientists are engineering

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
all of that into it right now.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
And then people would be able to eat it and they'd be able to not go blind.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
They wouldn't starve, and you know what?

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
That would be nice. It wouldn't be Chez Panisse,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
but it would be nice.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
And all I can say about this is:

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Why are we fighting it?

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
I mean, let's ask ourselves: Why are we fighting it?

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Because we don't want to move genes around?

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
This is about moving genes around. It's not about chemicals.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
It's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
our insistence on having bigger food,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
better food, singular food.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
This isn't about Rice Krispies,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
this is about keeping people alive,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
and it's about time we started to understand what that meant.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Because, you know something?

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
If we don't, if we continue to act the way we're acting,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
we're guilty of something that I don't think we want to be guilty of:

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
high-tech colonialism.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
There's no other way to describe what's going on here.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
It's selfish, it's ugly,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
it's beneath us,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
and we really have to stop it.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
So after this amazingly fun conversation,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
(Laughter)

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
you might want to say, "So, you still want to get in this

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
ridiculous time machine and go forward?"

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Absolutely. Absolutely, I do.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
It's stuck in the present right now,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
but we have an amazing opportunity.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
We can set that time machine on anything we want.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
We can move it where we want to move it,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
and we're going to move it where we want to move it.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
We have to have these conversations and we have to think,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
we're going to be happy we do.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
I know that we can,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
and as far as I'm concerned,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
that's something the world needs right now.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
(Applause)

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Thank you.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Thank you.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Thank you. Thank you.
