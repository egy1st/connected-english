00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
In my industry,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
we believe that images can change the world.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Okay, we're naive, we're bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The truth is that we know that the

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
images themselves don't change the world,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
but we're also aware that, since the beginning of photography,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
images have provoked reactions in people,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and those reactions have caused change to happen.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So let's begin with a group of images.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I'd be extremely surprised

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
if you didn't recognize many or most of them.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
They're best described as iconic:

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
so iconic, perhaps, they're cliches.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
In fact, they're so well-known

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
that you might even recognize them

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
in a slightly or somewhat different form.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
(Laughter)

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
But I think we're looking for something more.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
We're looking for something more.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We're looking for images that shine

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
an uncompromising light on crucial issues,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
images that transcend borders, that transcend religions,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
images that provoke us

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
to step up and do something --

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
in other words, to act.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Well, this image you've all seen.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
It changed our view of the physical world.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
We had never seen our planet from this perspective before.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Many people credit

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
a lot of the birth of the environmental movement

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
to our seeing the planet like this

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
for the first time --

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
its smallness, its fragility.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Forty years later, this group, more than most,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
are well aware of the destructive power

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
that our species can wield over our environment.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And at last, we appear to be doing something about it.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
This destructive power takes many different forms.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
For example, these images taken by Brent Stirton

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
in the Congo.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
These gorillas were murdered, some would even say crucified,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and unsurprisingly,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
they sparked international outrage.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Most recently,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
we've been tragically reminded of the destructive power of nature itself

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
with the recent earthquake in Haiti.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Well, I think what is far worse

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
is man's destructive power over man.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Samuel Pisar, an Auschwitz survivor, said,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and I'll quote him,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
"The Holocaust teaches us that nature,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
even in its cruelest moments,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
is benign in comparison with man,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
when he loses his moral compass and his reason."

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
There's another kind of crucifixion.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
The horrifying images from Abu Ghraib

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
as well as the images from Guantanamo

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
had a profound impact.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
The publication of those images,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
as opposed to the images themselves,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
caused a government to change its policies.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Some would argue that it is those images

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
that did more to fuel the insurgency in Iraq

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
than virtually any other single act.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Furthermore, those images forever removed

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
the so-called moral high ground of the occupying forces.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Let's go back a little.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
In the 1960s and 1970s,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
the Vietnam War was basically shown

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
in America's living rooms day in, day out.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
News photos brought people face to face

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
with the victims of the war: a little girl burned by napalm,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
a student killed by the National Guard

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
at Kent State University in Ohio during a protest.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
In fact, these images became

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
the voices of protest themselves.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Now, images have power

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
to shed light of understanding

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
on suspicion, ignorance,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and in particular -- I've given a lot of talks on this

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
but I'll just show one image --

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
the issue of HIV/AIDS.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
In the 1980s, the stigmatization of people with the disease

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
was an enormous barrier

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
to even discussing or addressing it.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
A simple act, in 1987, of the most famous woman in the world,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
the Princess of Wales, touching

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
an HIV/AIDS infected baby

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
did a great deal, especially in Europe, to stop that.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
She, better than most, knew the power of an image.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
So when we are confronted by a powerful image,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
we all have a choice:

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
We can look away, or we can address the image.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Thankfully, when these photos appeared in

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
The Guardian in 1998,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
they put a lot of focus and attention and, in the end, a lot of money

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
towards the Sudan famine relief efforts.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Did the images change the world?

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
No, but they had a major impact.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Images often push us to question our core beliefs

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
and our responsibilities to each other.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
We all saw those images after Katrina,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
and I think for millions of people

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
they had a very strong impact.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
And I think it's very unlikely

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
that they were far from the minds of Americans

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
when they went to vote in November 2008.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Unfortunately, some very important images

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
are deemed too graphic or disturbing for us to see them.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
I'll show you one photo here,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
and it's a photo by Eugene Richards of an Iraq War veteran

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
from an extraordinary piece of work,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
which has never been published, called War Is Personal.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
But images don't need to be graphic

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
in order to remind us of the tragedy of war.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
John Moore set up this photo at Arlington Cemetery.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
After all the tense moments of conflict

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
in all the conflict zones of the world,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
there's one photograph from a much quieter place

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
that haunts me still, much more than the others.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Ansel Adams said, and I'm going to disagree with him,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
"You don't take a photograph, you make it."

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
In my view, it's not the photographer who makes the photo,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
it's you.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
We bring to each image

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
our own values, our own belief systems,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
and as a result of that, the image resonates with us.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
My company has 70 million images.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
I have one image in my office.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Here it is.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
I hope that the next time you see

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
an image that sparks something in you,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
you'll better understand why,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
and I know that speaking to this audience,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
you'll definitely do something about it.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And thank you to all the photographers.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
(Applause)
