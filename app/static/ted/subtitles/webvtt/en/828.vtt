00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
First of all, I'm a geek.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I'm an organic food-eating,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
carbon footprint-minimizing, robotic surgery geek.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And I really want to build green,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
but I'm very suspicious

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
of all of these well-meaning articles,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
people long on moral authority

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and short on data,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
telling me how to do these kinds of things.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And so I have to figure this out for myself.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
For example: Is this evil?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I have dropped a blob of organic yogurt

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
from happy self-actualized local cows

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
on my counter top,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and I grab a paper towel and I want to wipe it up.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
But can I use a paper towel? (Laughter)

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The answer to this can be found in embodied energy.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
This is the amount of energy that goes into

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
any paper towel or embodied water,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and every time I use a paper towel,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I am using this much

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
virtual energy and water.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Wipe it up, throw it away.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Now, if I compare that to a cotton towel

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
that I can use a thousand times,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I don't have a whole lot of embodied energy

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
until I wash that yogurty towel.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
This is now operating energy.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
So if I throw my towel in the washing machine,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I've now put energy and water

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
back into that towel ...

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
unless I use a front-loading, high-efficiency washing machine, (Laughter)

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and then it looks a little bit better.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
But what about a recycled paper towel

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
that comes in those little half sheets?

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Well, now a paper towel looks better.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Screw the paper towels. Let's go to a sponge.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I wipe it up with a sponge, and I put it under the running water,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and I have a lot less energy and a lot more water.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Unless you're like me and you leave the handle

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
in the position of hot even when you turn it on,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and then you start to use more energy.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Or worse, you let it run until it's warm

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
to rinse out your towel.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And now all bets are off.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
(Laughter)

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So what this says is that

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
sometimes the things that you least expect --

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
the position in which you put the handle --

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
have a bigger effect than any of those other things

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
that you were trying to optimize.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Now imagine someone as twisted as me

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
trying to build a house.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
(Laughter)

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
That's what my husband and I are doing right now.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And so, we wanted to know, how green could we be?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And there's a thousand and one articles out there

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
telling us how to make all these green trade-offs.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And they are just as suspect

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
in telling us to optimize these little things around the edges

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and missing the elephant in the living room.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Now, the average house

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
has about 300 megawatt hours

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
of embodied energy in it;

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
this is the energy it takes to make it --

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
millions and millions of paper towels.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
We wanted to know how much better we could do.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And so, like many people,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
we start with a house on a lot,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and I'm going to show you a typical construction on the top

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and what we're doing on the bottom.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
So first, we demolish it.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
It takes some energy, but if you deconstruct it --

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
you take it all apart, you use the bits --

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
you can get some of that energy back.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
We then dug a big hole

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
to put in a rainwater catchment tank

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
to take our yard water independent.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
And then we poured a big foundation

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
for passive solar.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Now, you can reduce the embodied energy

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
by about 25 percent

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
by using high fly ash concrete.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
We then put in framing.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
And so this is framing -- lumber,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
composite materials --

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and it's kind of hard to get the embodied energy out of that,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
but it can be a sustainable resource

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
if you use FSC-certified lumber.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
We then go on to

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
the first thing that was very surprising.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
If we put aluminum windows in this house,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
we would double the energy use right there.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Now, PVC is a little bit better,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
but still not as good as the wood that we chose.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
We then put in plumbing,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
electrical and HVAC,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
and insulate.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Now, spray foam is an excellent insulator -- it fills in all the cracks --

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
but it is pretty high embodied energy,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
and, sprayed-in cellulose or blue jeans

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
is a much lower energy alternative to that.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
We also used straw bale

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
infill for our library,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
which has zero embodied energy.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
When it comes time to sheetrock,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
if you use EcoRock it's about a quarter

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
of the embodied energy of standard sheetrock.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And then you get to the finishes,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
the subject of all of those "go green" articles,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000
and on the scale of a house

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
they almost make no difference at all.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And yet, all the press is focused on that.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Except for flooring.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
If you put carpeting in your house,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
it's about a tenth of the embodied energy of the entire house,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
unless you use concrete or wood

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
for a much lower embodied energy.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
So now we add in the final construction energy, we add it all up,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
and we've built a house for less than half

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
of the typical embodied energy for building a house like this.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
But before we pat ourselves

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
too much on the back,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
we have poured 151 megawatt hours

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
of energy into constructing this house

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
when there was a house there before.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
And so the question is:

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
How could we make that back?

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And so if I run my new energy-efficient house forward,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
compared with the old, non-energy-efficient house,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
we make it back in about six years.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Now, I probably would have upgraded the old house

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
to be more energy-efficient,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
and in that case,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
it would take me more about 20 years to break even.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Now, if I hadn't paid attention to embodied energy,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
it would have taken us

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
over 50 years to break even

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
compared to the upgraded house.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
So what does this mean?

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
On the scale of my portion of the house,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
this is equivalent to about

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
as much as I drive in a year,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
it's about five times as much

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
as if I went entirely vegetarian.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
But my elephant in the living room flies.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Clearly, I need to walk home from TED.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
But all the calculations

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
for embodied energy are on the blog.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
And, remember, it's sometimes the things that you are not expecting

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
to be the biggest changes that are.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Thank you. (Applause)
