00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I have all my life wondered what "mind-boggling" meant.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:16.000
After two days here, I declare myself boggled, and enormously impressed,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and feel that you are one of the great hopes --

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
not just for American achievement in science and technology,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
but for the whole world.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I've come, however, on a special mission on behalf of my constituency,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:48.000
which are the 10-to-the-18th-power -- that's a million trillion --

00:00:48.000 --> 00:01:02.000
insects and other small creatures, and to make a plea for them.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
If we were to wipe out insects alone, just that group alone, on this planet --

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
which we are trying hard to do --

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:21.000
the rest of life and humanity with it would mostly disappear from the land.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And within a few months.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Now, how did I come to this particular position of advocacy?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
As a little boy, and through my teenage years,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I became increasingly fascinated by the diversity of life.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I had a butterfly period, a snake period, a bird period, a fish period, a cave period

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and finally and definitively, an ant period.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
By my college years, I was a devoted myrmecologist,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
a specialist on the biology of ants,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
but my attention and research continued to make journeys

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
across the great variety of life on Earth in general --

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:18.000
including all that it means to us as a species, how little we understand it

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and how pressing a danger that our activities have created for it.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Out of that broader study has emerged a concern and an ambition,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
crystallized in the wish that I'm about to make to you.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
My choice is the culmination of a lifetime commitment

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.000
that began with growing up on the Gulf Coast of Alabama, on the Florida peninsula.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:56.000
As far back as I can remember, I was enchanted by the natural beauty of that region

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
and the almost tropical exuberance of the plants and animals that grow there.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
One day when I was only seven years old and fishing,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I pulled a "pinfish," they're called, with sharp dorsal spines, up too hard and fast,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
and I blinded myself in one eye.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
I later discovered I was also hard of hearing,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
possibly congenitally, in the upper registers.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
So in planning to be a professional naturalist --

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
I never considered anything else in my entire life --

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.000
I found that I was lousy at bird watching and couldn't track frog calls either.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
So I turned to the teeming small creatures

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
that can be held between the thumb and forefinger:

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.000
the little things that compose the foundation of our ecosystems,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
the little things, as I like to say, who run the world.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:07.000
In so doing, I reached a frontier of biology so strange, so rich,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000
that it seemed as though it exists on another planet.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000
In fact, we live on a mostly unexplored planet.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.000
The great majority of organisms on Earth remain unknown to science.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.000
In the last 30 years, thanks to explorations in remote parts of the world

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
and advances in technology,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:40.000
biologists have, for example, added a full one-third of the known frog and other amphibian species,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
to bring the current total to 5,400,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
and more continue to pour in.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Two new kinds of whales have been discovered, along with two new antelopes,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
dozens of monkey species and a new kind of elephant --

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
and even a distinct kind of gorilla.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:09.000
At the extreme opposite end of the size scale, the class of marine bacteria,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.000
the Prochlorococci -- that will be on the final exam --

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:24.000
although discovered only in 1988, are now recognized as likely the most abundant organisms on Earth,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:31.000
and moreover, responsible for a large part of the photosynthesis that occurs in the ocean.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
These bacteria were not uncovered sooner

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
because they are also among the smallest of all Earth's organisms --

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000
so minute that they cannot be seen with conventional optical microscopy.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Yet life in the sea may depend on these tiny creatures.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
These examples are just the first glimpse of our ignorance of life on this planet.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Consider the fungi -- including mushrooms, rusts, molds and many disease-causing organisms.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
60,000 species are known to science,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000
but more than 1.5 million have been estimated to exist.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Consider the nematode roundworm, the most abundant of all animals.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Four out of five animals on Earth are nematode worms --

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
if all solid materials except nematode worms were to be eliminated,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.000
you could still see the ghostly outline of most of it in nematode worms.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000
About 16,000 species of nematode worms

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
have been discovered and diagnosed by scientists;

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
there could be hundreds of thousands of them, even millions, still unknown.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
This vast domain of hidden biodiversity is increased still further

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.000
by the dark matter of the biological world of bacteria,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000
which within just the last several years

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:12.000
still were known from only about 6,000 species of bacteria worldwide.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.000
But that number of bacteria species can be found in one gram of soil,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:27.000
just a little handful of soil, in the 10 billion bacteria that would be there.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000
It's been estimated that a single ton of soil -- fertile soil --

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:40.000
contains approximately four million species of bacteria, all unknown.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:48.000
So the question is: what are they all doing?

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
The fact is, we don't know.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:00.000
We are living on a planet with a lot of activities, with reference to our living environment,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
done by faith and guess alone.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Our lives depend upon these creatures.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:16.000
To take an example close to home: there are over 500 species of bacteria now known --

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000
friendly bacteria -- living symbiotically in your mouth and throat

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:28.000
probably necessary to your health for holding off pathogenic bacteria.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000
At this point I think we have a little impressionistic film

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
that was made especially for this occasion.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
And I'd like to show it.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Assisted in this by Billie Holiday.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
(Video)

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
And that may be just the beginning!

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.000
The viruses, those quasi-organisms among which are the prophages,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:58.000
the gene weavers that promote the continued evolution in the lives of the bacteria,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:07.000
are a virtually unknown frontier of modern biology, a world unto themselves.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
What constitutes a viral species is still unresolved,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
although they're obviously of enormous importance to us.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.000
But this much we can say: the variety of genes on the planet in viruses

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:28.000
exceeds, or is likely to exceed, that in all of the rest of life combined.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Nowadays, in addressing microbial biodiversity,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:39.000
scientists are like explorers in a rowboat launched onto the Pacific Ocean.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.000
But that is changing rapidly with the aid of new genomic technology.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Already it is possible to sequence the entire genetic code of a bacterium in under four hours.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Soon we will be in a position to go forth in the field with sequencers on our backs --

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:03.000
to hunt bacteria in tiny crevices of the habitat's surface

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
in the way you go watching for birds with binoculars.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:15.000
What will we find as we map the living world, as, finally, we get this underway seriously?

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.000
As we move past the relatively gigantic mammals, birds, frogs and plants

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.000
to the more elusive insects and other small invertebrates and then beyond

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000
to the countless millions of organisms in the invisible living world

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
enveloped and living within humanity?

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Already what were thought to be bacteria for generations

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:47.000
have been found to compose, instead, two great domains of microorganisms:

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
true bacteria and one-celled organisms the archaea,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:58.000
which are closer than other bacteria to the eukaryota, the group that we belong to.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Some serious biologists, and I count myself among them,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:12.000
have begun to wonder that among the enormous and still unknown diversity of microorganisms,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
one might -- just might -- find aliens among them.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
True aliens, stocks that arrived from outer space.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
They've had billions of years to do it,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:31.000
but especially during the earliest period of biological evolution on this planet.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
We do know that some bacterial species that have earthly origin

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:43.000
are capable of almost unimaginable extremes of temperature

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
and other harsh changes in environment,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:54.000
including hard radiation strong enough and maintained long enough to crack the Pyrex vessels

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
around the growing population of bacteria.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:03.000
There may be a temptation to treat the biosphere holistically

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:09.000
and the species that compose it as a great flux of entities

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
hardly worth distinguishing one from the other.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
But each of these species, even the tiniest Prochlorococci,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
are masterpieces of evolution.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Each has persisted for thousands to millions of years.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Each is exquisitely adapted to the environment in which it lives,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:37.000
interlocked with other species to form ecosystems upon which our own lives depend

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
in ways we have not begun even to imagine.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
We will destroy these ecosystems and the species composing them

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
at the peril of our own existence --

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:57.000
and unfortunately we are destroying them with ingenuity and ceaseless energy.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:07.000
My own epiphany as a conservationist came in 1953, while a Harvard graduate student,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
searching for rare ants found in the mountain forests of Cuba,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
ants that shine in the sunlight --

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:21.000
metallic green or metallic blue, according to species, and one species, I discovered, metallic gold.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
I found my magical ants, but only after a tough climb into the mountains

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
where the last of the native Cuban forests hung on,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:36.000
and were then -- and still are -- being cut back.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
I realized then that these species

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:45.000
and a large part of the other unique, marvelous animals and plants on that island --

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
and this is true of practically every part of the world --

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
which took millions of years to evolve, are in the process of disappearing forever.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000
And so it is everywhere one looks.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:08.000
The human juggernaut is permanently eroding Earth's ancient biosphere by a combination of forces

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.000
that can be summarized by the acronym "HIPPO," the animal hippo.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:20.000
H is for habitat destruction, including climate change forced by greenhouse gases.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:28.000
I is for the invasive species like the fire ants, the zebra mussels, broom grasses

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:39.000
and pathogenic bacteria and viruses that are flooding every country, and at an exponential rate -- that's the I.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
The P, the first one in "HIPPO," is for pollution.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:49.000
The second is for continued population, human population expansion.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
And the final letter is O, for over-harvesting --

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
driving species into extinction by excessive hunting and fishing.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:02.000
The HIPPO juggernaut we have created, if unabated, is destined --

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
according to the best estimates of ongoing biodiversity research --

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000
to reduce half of Earth's still surviving animal and plant species

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000
to extinction or critical endangerment by the end of the century.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Human-forced climate change alone -- again, if unabated --

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:27.000
could eliminate a quarter of surviving species during the next five decades.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
What will we and all future generations lose

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
if much of the living environment is thus degraded?

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
Huge potential sources of scientific information yet to be gathered,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
much of our environmental stability

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:52.000
and new kinds of pharmaceuticals and new products of unimaginable strength and value --

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
all thrown away.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
The loss will inflict a heavy price

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:05.000
in wealth, security and yes, spirituality for all time to come,

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
because previous cataclysms of this kind --

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
the last one, that ended the age of dinosaurs --

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:16.000
took, normally, five to 10 million years to repair.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:20.000
Sadly, our knowledge of biodiversity is so incomplete

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000
that we are at risk of losing a great deal of it before it is even discovered.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:34.000
For example, even in the United States, the 200,000 species known currently

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:41.000
actually has been found to be only partial in coverage;

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000
it is mostly unknown to us in basic biology.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:53.000
Only about 15 percent of the known species have been studied well enough to evaluate their status.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:59.000
Of the 15 percent evaluated, 20 percent are classified as "in peril,"

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
that is, in danger of extinction.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
That's in the United States.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:10.000
We are, in short, flying blind into our environmental future.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
We urgently need to change this.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000
We need to have the biosphere properly explored

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000
so that we can understand and competently manage it.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
We need to settle down before we wreck the planet.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.000
And we need that knowledge.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000
This should be a big science project equivalent to the Human Genome Project.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000
It should be thought of as a biological moonshot with a timetable.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
So this brings me to my wish for TEDsters,

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
and to anyone else around the world who hears this talk.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:48.000
I wish we will work together to help create the key tools

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000
that we need to inspire preservation of Earth's biodiversity.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
And let us call it the "Encyclopedia of Life."

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
What is the "Encyclopedia of Life?" A concept that has already taken hold

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
and is beginning to spread and be looked at seriously?

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000
It is an encyclopedia that lives on the Internet

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000
and is contributed to by thousands of scientists around the world.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Amateurs can do it also.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000
It has an indefinitely expandable page for each species.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:26.000
It makes all key information about life on Earth accessible to anyone,

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
on demand, anywhere in the world.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.000
I've written about this idea before,

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:39.000
and I know there are people in this room who have expended significant effort on it in the past.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:47.000
But what excites me is that since I first put forward this particular idea in that form,

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
science has advanced.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000
Technology has moved forward.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000
Today, the practicalities of making such an encyclopedia,

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:02.000
regardless of the magnitude of the information put into it, are within reach.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Indeed, in the past year, a group of influential scientific institutions

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
have begun mobilizing to realize this dream.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000
I wish you would help them.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Working together, we can make this real.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000
The encyclopedia will quickly pay for itself in practical applications.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:28.000
It will address transcendent qualities in the human consciousness, and sense of human need.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:34.000
It will transform the science of biology in ways of obvious benefit to humanity.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.000
And most of all, it can inspire a new generation of biologists

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:44.000
to continue the quest that started, for me personally, 60 years ago:

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:49.000
to search for life, to understand it and finally, above all, to preserve it.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000
That is my wish. Thank you.
