00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I first became fascinated with octopus at an early age.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I grew up in Mobile, Alabama --

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
somebody's got to be from Mobile, right? --

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and Mobile sits at the confluence of five rivers,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
forming this beautiful delta.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And the delta has alligators crawling

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
in and out of rivers filled with fish

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and cypress trees dripping with snakes,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
birds of every flavor.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It's an absolute magical wonderland to live in --

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
if you're a kid interested in animals, to grow up in.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And this delta water flows to Mobile Bay, and finally into the Gulf of Mexico.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And I remember my first real contact with octopus

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
was probably at age five or six.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I was in the gulf, and I was swimming around and saw a little octopus on the bottom.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And I reached down and picked him up, and immediately

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
became fascinated and impressed by its speed and its strength and agility.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
It was prying my fingers apart and moving to the back of my hand.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It was all I could do to hold onto this amazing creature.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Then it sort of calmed down in the palms of my hands

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and started flashing colors,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
just pulsing all of these colors.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And as I looked at it, it kind of tucked its arms under it,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
raised into a spherical shape

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and turned chocolate brown with two white stripes.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I'm going, "My gosh!" I had never seen anything like this in my life!

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
So I marveled for a moment, and then decided it was time to release him,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
so I put him down.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The octopus left my hands and then did the damnedest thing:

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
It landed on the bottom in the rubble

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and -- fwoosh! -- vanished

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
right before my eyes.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And I knew, right then, at age six,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
that is an animal that I want to learn more about. So I did.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And I went off to college and got a degree in marine zoology,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and then moved to Hawaii and entered graduate school

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
at the University of Hawaii.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And while a student at Hawaii, I worked at the Waikiki Aquarium.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And the aquarium had a lot of big fish tanks

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
but not a lot of invertebrate displays,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and being the spineless guy, I thought, well

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I'll just go out in the field and collect these wonderful animals

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I had been learning about as a student

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and bring them in, and I built these elaborate sets and put them on display.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Now, the fish in the tanks were gorgeous to look at,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
but they didn't really interact with people.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
But the octopus did.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
If you walked up to an octopus tank,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
especially early in the morning before anyone arrived,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
the octopus would rise up and look at you

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and you're thinking, "Is that guy really looking at me? He is looking at me!"

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And you walk up to the front of the tank. Then you realize

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
that these animals all have different personalities:

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Some of them would hold their ground,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
others would slink into the back of the tank and disappear in the rocks,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and one in particular, this amazing animal ...

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I went up to the front of the tank, and he's just staring at me,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and he had little horns come up above his eyes.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
So I went right up to the front of the tank --

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I was three or four inches from the front glass --

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and the octopus was sitting on a perch, a little rock,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and he came off the rock and he also came down right to the front of the glass.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
So I was staring at this animal about six or seven inches away,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and at that time I could actually focus that close;

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
now as I look at my fuzzy fingers I realize those days are long gone.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Anyway, there we were, staring at each other,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and he reaches down and grabs an armful of gravel

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and releases it in the jet of water entering the tank

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
from the filtration system,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
and -- chk chk chk chk chk! -- this gravel hits the front of the glass and falls down.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
He reaches up, takes another armful of gravel, releases it --

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
chk chk chk chk chk! -- same thing.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Then he lifts another arm and I lift an arm.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Then he lifts another arm and I lift another arm.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And then I realize the octopus won the arms race,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
because I was out and he had six left. (Laughter)

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
But the only way I can describe what I was seeing that day

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
was that this octopus was playing,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
which is a pretty sophisticated behavior for a mere invertebrate.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
So, about three years into my degree,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
a funny thing happened on the way to the office,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
which actually changed the course of my life.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
A man came into the aquarium. It's a long story, but essentially

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
he sent me and a couple of friends of mine to the South Pacific

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
to collect animals for him,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
and as we left, he gave us two 16-millimeter movie cameras.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
He said, "Make a movie about this expedition."

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
"OK, a couple of biologists making a movie --

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
this'll be interesting,"

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
and off we went. And we did, we made a movie,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
which had to be the worst movie ever made

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
in the history of movie making,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
but it was a blast. I had so much fun.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And I remember that proverbial light going off in my head,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
thinking, "Wait a minute.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Maybe I can do this all the time.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Yeah, I'll be a filmmaker."

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
So I literally came back from that job,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
quit school, hung my filmmaking shingle

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
and just never told anyone that I didn't know what I was doing.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
It's been a good ride.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
And what I learned in school though was really beneficial.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
If you're a wildlife filmmaker

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
and you're going out into the field to film animals,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
especially behavior,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
it helps to have a fundamental background

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
on who these animals are,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
how they work and, you know, a bit about their behaviors.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
But where I really learned about octopus

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
was in the field, as a filmmaker

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
making films with them,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
where you're allowed to spend large periods of time

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
with the animals, seeing octopus being octopus

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
in their ocean homes.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
I remember I took a trip to Australia,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
went to an island called One Tree Island.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And apparently, evolution had occurred

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
at a pretty rapid rate on One Tree,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
between the time they named it and the time I arrived,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
because I'm sure there were at least three trees

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
on that island when we were there.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Anyway, one tree is situated right next to

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
a beautiful coral reef.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
In fact, there's a surge channel

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
where the tide is moving back and forth, twice a day, pretty rapidly.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000
And there's a beautiful reef,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
very complex reef, with lots of animals,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
including a lot of octopus.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And not uniquely

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
but certainly, the octopus in Australia

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
are masters at camouflage.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
As a matter of fact,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
there's one right there.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
So our first challenge was to find these things,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
and that was a challenge, indeed.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
But the idea is, we were there for a month

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
and I wanted to acclimate the animals to us

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
so that we could see behaviors without disturbing them.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
So the first week was pretty much spent

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
just getting as close as we could,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
every day a little closer, a little closer, a little closer.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
And you knew what the limit was: they would start getting twitchy

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
and you'd back up, come back in a few hours.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
And after the first week, they ignored us.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
It was like, "I don't know what that thing is, but he's no threat to me."

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
So they went on about their business

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
and from a foot away, we're watching mating

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
and courting and fighting

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
and it is just an unbelievable experience.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And one of the most fantastic displays

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
that I remember, or at least visually,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
was a foraging behavior.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
And they had a lot of different techniques

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
that they would use for foraging,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
but this particular one used vision.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
And they would see a coral head,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
maybe 10 feet away,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and start moving over toward that coral head.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000
And I don't know whether they actually saw crab in it, or imagined that one might be,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
but whatever the case, they would leap off the bottom

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
and go through the water and land right on top of this coral head,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and then the web between the arms

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
would completely engulf the coral head,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
and they would fish out, swim for crabs.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
And as soon as the crabs touched the arm, it was lights out.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
And I always wondered what happened under that web.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
So we created a way to find out, (Laughter)

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
and I got my first look at that famous beak in action.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
It was fantastic.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
If you're going to make a lot of films about a particular group of animals,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
you might as well pick one that's fairly common.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And octopus are, they live in all the oceans.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
They also live deep.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And I can't say octopus are responsible

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
for my really strong interest

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
in getting in subs and going deep,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
but whatever the case, I like that.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
It's like nothing you've ever done.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
If you ever really want to get away from it all

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
and see something that you have never seen,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
and have an excellent chance of seeing something

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
no one has ever seen, get in a sub.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
You climb in, seal the hatch, turn on a little oxygen,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
turn on the scrubber,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
which removes the CO2 in the air you breathe, and they chuck you overboard.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Down you go. There's no connection to the surface

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
apart from a pretty funky radio.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
And as you go down, the washing machine

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
at the surface calms down.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
And it gets quiet.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And it starts getting really nice.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
And as you go deeper, that lovely, blue water you were launched in

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
gives way to darker and darker blue.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
And finally, it's a rich lavender,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
and after a couple of thousand feet, it's ink black.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
And now you've entered the realm

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
of the mid-water community.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
You could give an entire talk

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
about the creatures that live in the mid-water.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Suffice to say though, as far as I'm concerned,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
without question, the most bizarre designs

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
and outrageous behaviors

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
are in the animals that live in the mid-water community.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
But we're just going to zip right past this area,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
this area that includes about 95 percent

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
of the living space on our planet

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
and go to the mid-ocean ridge, which I think is even more extraordinary.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
The mid-ocean ridge is a huge mountain range,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
40,000 miles long, snaking around the entire globe.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
And they're big mountains, thousands of feet tall,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
some of which are tens of thousands of feet

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
and bust through the surface,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
creating islands like Hawaii.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
And the top of this mountain range

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
is splitting apart, creating a rift valley.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
And when you dive into that rift valley, that's where the action is

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
because literally thousands of active volcanoes

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
are going off at any point in time

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
all along this 40,000 mile range.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And as these tectonic plates are spreading apart,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
magma, lava is coming up and filling those gaps,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
and you're looking land -- new land --

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
being created right before your eyes.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
And over the tops of them is 3,000 to 4,000 meters of water

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
creating enormous pressure,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
forcing water down through the cracks toward the center of the earth,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
until it hits a magma chamber

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
where it becomes superheated

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
and supersaturated with minerals,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
reverses its flow and starts shooting back to the surface

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
and is ejected out of the earth like a geyser at Yellowstone.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
In fact, this whole area

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
is like a Yellowstone National Park with all of the trimmings.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
And this vent fluid is about 600 or 700 degrees F.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
The surrounding water is just a couple of degrees above freezing.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
So it immediately cools,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
and it can no longer hold in suspension

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
all of the material that it's dissolved,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
and it precipitates out, forming black smoke.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
And it forms these towers, these chimneys

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
that are 10, 20, 30 feet tall.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
And all along the sides of these chimneys

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
is shimmering with heat and loaded with life.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
You've got black smokers going all over the place

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
and chimneys that have tube worms

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
that might be eight to 10 feet long.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
And out of the tops of these tube worms

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
are these beautiful red plumes.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
And living amongst the tangle of tube worms

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
is an entire community of animals:

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
shrimp, fish, lobsters, crab,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
clams and swarms of arthropods

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
that are playing that dangerous game

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
between over here is scalding hot and freezing cold.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
And this whole ecosystem

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
wasn't even known about

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
until 33 years ago.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
And it completely threw science on its head.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
It made scientists rethink

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
where life on Earth might have actually begun.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
And before the discovery of these vents,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
all life on Earth, the key to life on Earth,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
was believed to be the sun and photosynthesis.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
But down there, there is no sun,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
there is no photosynthesis;

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
it's chemosynthetic environment down there driving it,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
and it's all so ephemeral.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
You might film this

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
unbelievable hydrothermal vent,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
which you think at the time has to be on another planet.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
It's amazing to think that this is actually on earth;

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
it looks like aliens in an alien environment.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
But you go back to the same vent eight years later

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
and it can be completely dead.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
There's no hot water.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
All of the animals are gone, they're dead,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
and the chimneys are still there

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
creating a really nice ghost town,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
an eerie, spooky ghost town,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
but essentially devoid of animals, of course.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
But 10 miles down the ridge...

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
pshhh! There's another volcano going.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
And there's a whole new hydrothermal vent community that has been formed.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
And this kind of life and death of hydrothermal vent communities

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
is going on every 30 or 40 years

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
all along the ridge.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
And that ephemeral nature

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
of the hydrothermal vent community

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
isn't really different from some of the

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
areas that I've seen

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
in 35 years of traveling around, making films.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Where you go and film a really nice sequence at a bay.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
And you go back, and I'm at home,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
and I'm thinking, "Okay, what can I shoot ...

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Ah! I know where I can shoot that.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
There's this beautiful bay, lots of soft corals and stomatopods."

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
And you show up, and it's dead.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
There's no coral, algae growing on it, and the water's pea soup.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
You think, "Well, what happened?"

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
And you turn around,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
and there's a hillside behind you with a neighborhood going in,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
and bulldozers are pushing piles of soil back and forth.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
And over here

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
there's a golf course going in.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
And this is the tropics.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
It's raining like crazy here.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
So this rainwater is flooding down the hillside,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
carrying with it sediments from the construction site,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
smothering the coral and killing it.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
And fertilizers and pesticides

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
are flowing into the bay from the golf course --

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
the pesticides killing all the larvae and little animals,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
fertilizer creating this beautiful plankton bloom --

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
and there's your pea soup.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
But, encouragingly, I've seen just the opposite.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
I've been to a place that was a pretty trashed bay.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
And I looked at it, just said, "Yuck,"

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
and go and work on the other side of the island.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Five years later, come back,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
and that same bay is now gorgeous. It's beautiful.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
It's got living coral, fish all over the place,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
crystal clear water, and you go, "How did that happen?"

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Well, how it happened is

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
the local community galvanized.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
They recognized what was happening on the hillside and put a stop to it;

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
enacted laws and made permits required

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
to do responsible construction

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
and golf course maintenance

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
and stopped the sediments flowing into the bay,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
and stopped the chemicals flowing into the bay,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
and the bay recovered.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
The ocean has an amazing ability

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
to recover, if we'll just leave it alone.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
I think Margaret Mead

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
said it best.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
She said that a small group of thoughtful people

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
could change the world.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
And a small group of thoughtful people

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
changed that bay.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
I'm a big fan of grassroots organizations.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
I've been to a lot of lectures

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
where, at the end of it, inevitably,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
one of the first questions that comes up is,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
"But, but what can I do?

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
I'm an individual. I'm one person.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
And these problems are so large and global, and it's just overwhelming."

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Fair enough question.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
My answer to that is don't look

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
at the big, overwhelming issues of the world.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Look in your own backyard.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Look in your heart, actually.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
What do you really care about that isn't right where you live?

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
And fix it.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Create a healing zone in your neighborhood

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
and encourage others to do the same.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
And maybe these healing zones can sprinkle a map,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
little dots on a map.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
And in fact, the way that we can communicate today --

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
where Alaska is instantly knowing what's going on in China,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
and the Kiwis did this, and then over in England they tried to ...

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
and everybody is talking to everyone else --

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
it's not isolated points on a map anymore,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
it's a network we've created.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
And maybe these healing zones can start growing,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
and possibly even overlap, and good things can happen.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
So that's how I answer that question.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Look in your own backyard, in fact, look in the mirror.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
What can you do that is more responsible

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
than what you're doing now?

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
And do that, and spread the word.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
The vent community animals

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
can't really do much

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
about the life and death

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
that's going on where they live, but up here we can.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
In theory, we're thinking, rational human beings.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
And we can make changes to our behavior

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
that will influence and affect the environment,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
like those people changed the health of that bay.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Now, Sylvia's TED Prize wish

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
was to beseech us to do anything we could,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
everything we could,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
to set aside not pin pricks,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
but significant expanses

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
of the ocean for preservation,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
"hope spots," she calls them.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
And I applaud that. I loudly applaud that.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
And it's my hope that some of these "hope spots"

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
can be in the deep ocean,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
an area that has historically

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
been seriously neglected, if not abused.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
The term "deep six" comes to mind:

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
"If it's too big or too toxic for a landfill,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
deep six it!"

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
So, I hope that we can also keep

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
some of these "hope spots" in the deep sea.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Now, I don't get a wish,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
but I certainly can say

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
that I will do anything I can

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
to support Sylvia Earle's wish.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
And that I do.
