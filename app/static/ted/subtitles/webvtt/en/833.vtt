00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In the spirit of Jacques Cousteau, who said,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
"People protect what they love,"

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I want to share with you today what I love most in the ocean,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and that's the incredible number and variety

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
of animals in it that make light.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
My addiction began with this strange looking diving suit called Wasp;

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that's not an acronym -- just somebody thought it looked like the insect.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It was actually developed for use by the offshore oil industry

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
for diving on oil rigs down to a depth of 2,000 feet.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Right after I completed my Ph.D.,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I was lucky enough to be included with a group of scientists

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
that was using it for the first time

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
as a tool for ocean exploration.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
We trained in a tank in Port Hueneme,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and then my first open ocean dive

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
was in Santa Barbara Channel.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
It was an evening dive.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I went down to a depth of 880 feet

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and turned out the lights.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And the reason I turned out the lights is because I knew I would see

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
this phenomenon of animals making light

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
called bioluminescence.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
But I was totally unprepared

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
for how much there was

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and how spectacular it was.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I saw chains of jellyfish called siphonophores

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
that were longer than this room,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
pumping out so much light

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
that I could read the dials and gauges

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
inside the suit without a flashlight;

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and puffs and billows

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
of what looked like luminous blue smoke;

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and explosions of sparks

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
that would swirl up out of the thrusters --

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
just like when you throw a log on a campfire and the embers swirl up off the campfire,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
but these were icy, blue embers.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
It was breathtaking.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Now, usually if people are familiar with bioluminescence at all,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
it's these guys; it's fireflies.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And there are a few other land-dwellers that can make light --

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
some insects, earthworms, fungi --

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
but in general, on land, it's really rare.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
In the ocean, it's the rule

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
rather than the exception.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
If I go out in the open ocean environment,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
virtually anywhere in the world,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and I drag a net from 3,000 feet to the surface,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
most of the animals --

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
in fact, in many places, 80 to 90 percent

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
of the animals that I bring up in that net --

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
make light.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
This makes for some pretty spectacular light shows.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Now I want to share with you a little video

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
that I shot from a submersible.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I first developed this technique working from a little

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
single-person submersible called Deep Rover

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and then adapted it for use on the Johnson Sea-Link,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
which you see here.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So, mounted in front of the observation sphere,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
there's a a three-foot diameter hoop

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
with a screen stretched across it.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And inside the sphere with me is an intensified camera

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
that's about as sensitive as a fully dark-adapted human eye,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
albeit a little fuzzy.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So you turn on the camera, turn out the lights.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
That sparkle you're seeing is not luminescence,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
that's just electronic noise

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
on these super intensified cameras.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
You don't see luminescence until the submersible

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
begins to move forward through the water,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
but as it does, animals bumping into the screen

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
are stimulated to bioluminesce.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Now, when I was first doing this,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
all I was trying to do was count the numbers of sources.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I knew my forward speed, I knew the area,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and so I could figure out how many hundreds of sources

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
there were per cubic meter.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
But I started to realize that I could actually identify animals

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
by the type of flashes they produced.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And so, here, in the Gulf of Maine

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
at 740 feet,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I can name pretty much everything you're seeing there to the species level.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Like those big explosions, sparks,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
are from a little comb jelly,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and there's krill and other kinds of crustaceans,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and jellyfish.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
There was another one of those comb jellies.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And so I've worked with computer image analysis engineers

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
to develop automatic recognition systems

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
that can identify these animals

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
and then extract the XYZ coordinate of the initial impact point.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And we can then do the kinds of things that ecologists do on land,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
and do nearest neighbor distances.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
But you don't always have to go down to the depths of the ocean

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
to see a light show like this.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
You can actually see it in surface waters.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
This is some shot, by Dr. Mike Latz at Scripps Institution,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
of a dolphin swimming through bioluminescent plankton.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And this isn't someplace exotic

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
like one of the bioluminescent bays in Puerto Rico,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
this was actually shot in San Diego Harbor.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And sometimes you can see it even closer than that,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
because the heads on ships --

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
that's toilets, for any land lovers that are listening --

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
are flushed with unfiltered seawater

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
that often has bioluminescent plankton in it.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
So, if you stagger into the head late at night

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
and you're so toilet-hugging sick

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
that you forget to turn on the light,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
you may think that you're having a religious experience. (Laughter)

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
So, how does a living creature make light?

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Well, that was the question that 19th century

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
French physiologist Raphael Dubois,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
asked about this bioluminescent clam.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
He ground it up and he managed to get out a couple of chemicals;

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
one, the enzyme, he called luciferase;

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
the substrate, he called luciferin

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
after Lucifer the Lightbearer.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
That terminology has stuck, but it doesn't actually refer to specific chemicals

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
because these chemicals come in a lot of different shapes and forms.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
In fact, most of the people

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
studying bioluminescence today

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
are focused on the chemistry, because these chemicals

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
have proved so incredibly valuable

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
for developing antibacterial agents,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
cancer fighting drugs,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
testing for the presence of life on Mars,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
detecting pollutants in our waters --

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
which is how we use it at ORCA.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
In 2008,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
the Nobel Prize in Chemistry

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
was awarded for work done

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
on a molecule called green fluorescent protein

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
that was isolated from the bioluminescent chemistry

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
of a jellyfish,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
and it's been equated to the invention of the microscope,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
in terms of the impact that it has had

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
on cell biology and genetic engineering.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Another thing all these molecules are telling us

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
that, apparently, bioluminescence has evolved

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
at least 40 times, maybe as many as 50 separate times

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
in evolutionary history,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
which is a clear indication

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
of how spectacularly important

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
this trait is for survival.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
So, what is it about bioluminescence

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
that's so important to so many animals?

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Well, for animals that are trying to avoid predators

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
by staying in the darkness,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
light can still be very useful

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
for the three basic things that animals have to do to survive:

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
and that's find food,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
attract a mate and avoid being eaten.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
So, for example, this fish

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
has a built-in headlight behind its eye

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
that it can use for finding food

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
or attracting a mate.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
And then when it's not using it, it actually can roll it down into its head

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
just like the headlights on your Lamborghini.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
This fish actually has high beams.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And this fish, which is one of my favorites,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
has three headlights on each side of its head.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Now, this one is blue,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
and that's the color of most bioluminescence in the ocean

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
because evolution has selected

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
for the color that travels farthest through seawater

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
in order to optimize communication.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
So, most animals make blue light,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
and most animals can only see blue light,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
but this fish is a really fascinating exception

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
because it has two red light organs.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
And I have no idea why there's two,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and that's something I want to solve some day --

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
but not only can it see blue light,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
but it can see red light.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
So it uses its red bioluminescence like a sniper's scope

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
to be able to sneak up on animals

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
that are blind to red light

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
and be able to see them without being seen.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
It's also got a little chin barbel here

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
with a blue luminescent lure on it

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
that it can use to attract prey from a long way off.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
And a lot of animals will use their bioluminescence as a lure.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
This is another one of my favorite fish.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
This is a viperfish, and it's got a lure

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
on the end of a long fishing rod

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
that it arches in front of the toothy jaw

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
that gives the viperfish its name.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
The teeth on this fish are so long

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
that if they closed inside the mouth of the fish,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
it would actually impale its own brain.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
So instead, it slides in grooves

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
on the outside of the head.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
This is a Christmas tree of a fish;

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
everything on this fish lights up,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
it's not just that lure.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
It's got a built-in flashlight.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
It's got these jewel-like light organs on its belly

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
that it uses for a type of camouflage

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
that obliterates its shadow,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
so when it's swimming around and there's a predator looking up from below,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
it makes itself disappear.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
It's got light organs in the mouth,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
it's got light organs in every single scale, in the fins,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
in a mucus layer on the back and the belly,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
all used for different things --

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
some of which we know about, some of which we don't.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
And we know a little bit more about bioluminescence thanks to Pixar,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
and I'm very grateful to Pixar for sharing

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
my favorite topic with so many people.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
I do wish, with their budget,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
that they might have spent just a tiny bit more money

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
to pay a consulting fee to some poor, starving graduate student,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
who could have told them that those are the eyes

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
of a fish that's been preserved in formalin.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
These are the eyes of a living anglerfish.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
So, she's got a lure that she sticks out

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
in front of this living mousetrap

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
of needle-sharp teeth

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
in order to attract in some unsuspecting prey.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
And this one has a lure

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
with all kinds of little interesting threads coming off it.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Now we used to think that the different shape of the lure

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
was to attract different types of prey,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
but then stomach content analyses on these fish

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
done by scientists, or more likely their graduate students,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
have revealed that

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
they all eat pretty much the same thing.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
So, now we believe that the different shape of the lure

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
is how the male recognizes the female

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
in the anglerfish world,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
because many of these males

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
are what are known as dwarf males.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
This little guy

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
has no visible means of self-support.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
He has no lure for attracting food

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
and no teeth for eating it when it gets there.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
His only hope for existence on this planet

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
is as a gigolo. (Laughter)

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
He's got to find himself a babe

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
and then he's got to latch on for life.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
So this little guy

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
has found himself this babe,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
and you will note that he's had the good sense

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
to attach himself in a way that he doesn't actually have to look at her.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
(Laughter)

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
But he still knows a good thing when he sees it,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
and so he seals the relationship with an eternal kiss.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
His flesh fuses with her flesh,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
her bloodstream grows into his body,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
and he becomes nothing more than a little sperm sac.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
(Laughter)

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Well, this is a deep-sea version of Women's Lib.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
She always knows where he is,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
and she doesn't have to be monogamous,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
because some of these females

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
come up with multiple males attached.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
So they can use it for finding food, for attracting mates.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
They use it a lot for defense, many different ways.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
A lot of them can release their luciferin or luferase in the water

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
just the way a squid or an octopus will release an ink cloud.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
This shrimp is actually

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
spewing light out of its mouth

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
like a fire breathing dragon

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
in order to blind or distract this viperfish

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
so that the shrimp can swim away into the darkness.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
And there are a lot of different animals that can do this:

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
There's jellyfish, there's squid,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
there's a whole lot of different crustaceans,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
there's even fish that can do this.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
This fish is called the shining tubeshoulder

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
because it actually has a tube on its shoulder

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
that can squirt out light.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
And I was luck enough to capture one of these

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
when we were on a trawling expedition

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
off the northwest coast of Africa for "Blue Planet,"

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
for the deep portion of "Blue Planet."

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
And we were using a special trawling net

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
that we were able to bring these animals up alive.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
So we captured one of these, and I brought it into the lab.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
So I'm holding it,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
and I'm about to touch that tube on its shoulder,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
and when I do, you'll see bioluminescence coming out.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
But to me, what's shocking

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
is not just the amount of light,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
but the fact that it's not just luciferin and luciferase.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
For this fish, it's actually whole cells

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
with nuclei and membranes.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
It's energetically very costly for this fish to do this,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
and we have no idea why it does it --

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
another one of these great mysteries that needs to be solved.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Now, another form of defense

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
is something called a burglar alarm --

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
same reason you have a burglar alarm on your car;

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
the honking horn and flashing lights

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
are meant to attract the attention of, hopefully,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
the police that will come and take the burglar away --

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
when an animal's caught in the clutches of a predator,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
its only hope for escape may be

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
to attract the attention of something bigger and nastier

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
that will attack their attacker,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
thereby affording them a chance for escape.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
This jellyfish, for example, has

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
a spectacular bioluminescent display.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
This is us chasing it in the submersible.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
That's not luminescence, that's reflected light from the gonads.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
We capture it in a very special device on the front of the submersible

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
that allows us to bring it up in really pristine condition,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
bring it into the lab on the ship.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
And then to generate the display you're about to see,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
all I did was touch it once per second

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
on its nerve ring with a sharp pick

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
that's sort of like the sharp tooth of a fish.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
And once this display gets going, I'm not touching it anymore.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
This is an unbelievable light show.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
It's this pinwheel of light,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
and I've done calculations that show that this could be seen

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
from as much as 300 feet away by a predator.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
And I thought, "You know,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
that might actually make a pretty good lure."

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Because one of the things that's frustrated me

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
as a deep-sea explorer

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
is how many animals there probably are in the ocean that we know nothing about

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
because of the way we explore the ocean.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
The primary way that we know about what lives in the ocean

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
is we go out and drag nets behind ships.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
And I defy you to name any other branch of science

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
that still depends on hundreds of year-old technology.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
The other primary way is we go down

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
with submersibles and remote-operated vehicles.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
I've made hundreds of dives in submersibles.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
When I'm sitting in a submersible though,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
I know that I'm not unobtrusive at all --

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
I've got bright lights and noisy thrusters --

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
any animal with any sense is going to be long gone.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
So, I've wanted for a long time

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
to figure out a different way to explore.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
And so, sometime ago, I got this idea for a camera system.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
It's not exactly rocket science. We call this thing Eye-in-the-Sea.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
And scientists have done this on land for years;

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
we just use a color that the animals can't see

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
and then a camera that can see that color.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
You can't use infrared in the sea.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
We use far-red light, but even that's a problem

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
because it gets absorbed so quickly.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Made an intensified camera,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
wanted to make this electronic jellyfish.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Thing is, in science,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
you basically have to tell the funding agencies what you're going to discover

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
before they'll give you the money.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
And I didn't know what I was going to discover,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
so I couldn't get the funding for this.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
So I kluged this together, I got the Harvey Mudd Engineering Clinic

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
to actually do it as an undergraduate student project initially,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
and then I kluged funding from a whole bunch of different sources.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
gave me time with their ROV

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
so that I could test it and we could figure out,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
you know, for example, which colors of red light we had to use

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
so that we could see the animals, but they couldn't see us --

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
get the electronic jellyfish working.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
And you can see just what a shoestring operation this really was,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
because we cast these 16 blue LEDs in epoxy

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
and you can see in the epoxy mold that we used,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
the word Ziploc is still visible.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Needless to say, when it's kluged together like this,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
there were a lot of trials and tribulations getting this working.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
But there came a moment when it all came together,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
and everything worked.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
And, remarkably, that moment got caught on film

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
by photographer Mark Richards,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
who happened to be there at the precise moment

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
that we discovered that it all came together.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
That's me on the left,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
my graduate student at the time, Erika Raymond,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
and Lee Fry, who was the engineer on the project.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
And we have this photograph posted in our lab in a place of honor

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
with the caption: "Engineer satisfying two women at once." (Laughter)

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
And we were very, very happy.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
So now we had a system

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
that we could actually take to some place

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
that was kind of like an oasis on the bottom of the ocean

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
that might be patrolled by large predators.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
And so, the place that we took it to

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
was this place called a Brine Pool,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
which is in the northern part of the Gulf of Mexico.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
It's a magical place.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
And I know this footage isn't going to look like anything to you --

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
we had a crummy camera at the time --

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
but I was ecstatic.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
We're at the edge of the Brine Pool,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
there's a fish that's swimming towards the camera.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
It's clearly undisturbed by us.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
And I had my window into the deep sea.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
I, for the first time, could see what animals were doing down there

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
when we weren't down there disturbing them in some way.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Four hours into the deployment,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
we had programmed the electronic jellyfish

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
to come on for the first time.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Eighty-six seconds after

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
it went into its pinwheel display,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
we recorded this:

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
This is a squid, over six feet long,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
that is so new to science,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
it cannot be placed in any known scientific family.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
I could not have asked for a better proof of concept.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
And based on this, I went back to the National Science Foundation

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
and said, "This is what we will discover."

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
And they gave me enough money to do it right,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
which has involved developing the world's first deep-sea webcam --

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
which has been installed in

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
the Monterey Canyon for the past year --

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
and now, more recently,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
a modular form of this system,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
a much more mobile form

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
that's a lot easier to launch and recover,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
that I hope can be used on Sylvia's "hope spots"

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
to help explore

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
and protect these areas,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
and, for me, learn more about

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
the bioluminescence in these "hope spots."

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
So one of these take-home messages here

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
is, there is still a lot to explore in the oceans.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
And Sylvia has said

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
that we are destroying the oceans before we even know what's in them,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
and she's right.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
So if you ever, ever get an opportunity

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
to take a dive in a submersible,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
say yes -- a thousand times, yes --

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
and please turn out the lights.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
I promise, you'll love it.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Thank you.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
(Applause)
