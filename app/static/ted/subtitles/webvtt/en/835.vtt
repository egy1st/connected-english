WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Good morning.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Happy to see so many fine folks out here

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and so many smiling faces.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I have a very peculiar

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
background, attitude and approach

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
to the real world

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
because I am a conjurer.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Now, I prefer that term over magician,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
because if I were a magician, that would mean

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
that I use spells and incantations

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and weird gestures

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
in order to accomplish real magic.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
No, I don't do that; I'm a conjurer,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
who is someone who pretends to be

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
a real magician. (Laughter)

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Now, how do we go about that sort of thing?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
We depend on the fact

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
that audiences, such as yourselves,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
will make assumptions.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
For example, when I walked up here

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and I took the microphone from the stand

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and switched it on,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
you assumed this was a microphone, which it is not.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
(Laughter)

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
As a matter of fact, this is something

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
that about half of you, more than half of you will not be familiar with.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
It's a beard trimmer, you see?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And it makes a very bad microphone;

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I've tried it many times. (Laughter)

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
The other assumption that you made --

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and this little lesson is to show you

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
that you will make assumptions.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Not only that you can, but that you will

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
when they are properly suggested to you.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
You believe I'm looking at you.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Wrong. I'm not looking at you. I can't see you.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I know you're out there, they told me backstage, it's a full house and such.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I know you're there because I can hear you,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
but I can't see you because I normally wear glasses.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
These are not glasses, these are empty frames. (Laughter)

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Quite empty frames.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Now why would a grown man appear before you

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
wearing empty frames on his face?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
To fool you, ladies and gentlemen,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
to deceive you, to show that you, too,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
can make assumptions.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Don't you ever forget that.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Now, I have to do something -- first of all, switch to real glasses

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
so I can actually see you,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
which would probably be a convenience. I don't know.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I haven't had a good look. Well, it's not that great a convenience.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
(Laughter)

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I have to do something now, which seems

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
a little bit strange for a magician.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
But I'm going to take some medication.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
This is a full bottle of

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Calms Forte.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I'll explain that in just a moment.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Ignore the instructions,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
that's what the government has to put in there

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
to confuse you, I'm sure.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I will take enough of these. Mm.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Indeed, the whole container.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Thirty-two tablets of Calms Forte.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Now that I've done that -- I'll explain it in a moment --

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I must tell you that

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I am an actor.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I'm an actor who plays a specific part.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
I play the part of a magician,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
a wizard, if you will, a real wizard.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
If someone were to appear on this stage in front of me

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and actually claim to be

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
an ancient prince of Denmark named Hamlet,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
you would be insulted

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
and rightly so.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Why would a man assume that you would believe

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
something bizarre like this?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
But there exists out there

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
a very large population

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
of people who will tell you

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
that they have psychic, magical powers

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
that they can predict the future,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
that they can make contact with the deceased.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Oh, they also say

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
they will sell you astrology

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
or other fortunetelling methods.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Oh, they gladly sell you that, yes.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And they also say

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
that they can give you perpetual motion machines

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and free energy systems.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
They claim to be psychics,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
or sensitives, whatever they can.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
But the one thing that has made a big comeback

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
just recently

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
is this business of

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
speaking with the dead.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Now, to my innocent mind,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
dead implies

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
incapable of communicating. (Laughter)

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
You might agree with me on that.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
But these people, they tend to tell you that

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
not only can they communicate with the dead --

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
"Hi, there" --

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
but they can hear the dead as well,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and they can relay this information back to the living.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
I wonder if that's true.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
I don't think so, because

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
this subculture of people

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
use exactly the same gimmicks that we magicians do,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
exactly the same --

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
the same physical methods, the same psychological methods --

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
and they effectively and profoundly

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
deceive millions of people around the earth,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
to their detriment.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
They deceive these people,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
costs them a lot of money,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
cost them a lot of emotional anguish.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Billions of dollars are spent

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
every year, all over the globe,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
on these charlatans.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Now, I have two questions

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
I would like to ask these people

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
if I had the opportunity to do so.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
First question: If I want to ask them to call up --

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
because they do hear them through the ear.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
They listen to the spirits like this --

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
I'm going to ask you to call up the ghost of my grandmother

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
because, when she died, she had the family will,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
and she secreted it someplace. We don't know where it is,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
so we ask Granny, "Where is the will, Granny?"

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
What does Granny say? She says, "I'm in heaven and it's wonderful.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
I'm here with all my old friends, my deceased friends,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
and my family

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
and all the puppy dogs and the kittens that I used to have when I was a little girl.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
And I love you, and I'll always be with you.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Good bye."

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
And she didn't answer the damn question!

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Where is the will?

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Now, she could easily have said,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
"Oh, it's in the library on the second shelf, behind the encyclopedia,"

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
but she doesn't say that. No, she doesn't.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
She doesn't bring any useful information to us.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
We paid a lot of money for that information,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
be we didn't get it.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
The second question that I'd like to ask, rather simple:

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Suppose I ask them to contact

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
the spirit of my deceased father-in-law, as an example.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Why do they insist on saying --

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
remember, they speak into this ear --

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
why do they say, "My name starts with J or M?"

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Is this a hunting game?

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Hunting and fishing? What is it?

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Is it 20 questions? No, it's more like 120 questions.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
But it is a cruel, vicious,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
absolutely conscienceless --

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
I'll be all right, keep your seats (Laughter) --

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
game that these people play.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
And they take advantage of the innocent, the naive,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
the grieving, the needy people out there.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Now, this is a process

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
that is called cold reading.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
There's one fellow out there,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Van Praagh is his name, James Van Praagh.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
He's one of the big practitioners of this sort of thing.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
John Edward, Sylvia Browne

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
and Rosemary Altea, they are other operators.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
There are hundreds of them all over the earth, but in this country,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
James Van Praagh is very big.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And what does he do? He likes to tell you

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
how the deceased got deceased,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
the people he's talking to through his ear, you see?

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
So what he says is, very often, is like this: he says,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
"He tells me, he tells me, before he passed,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
that he had trouble breathing."

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Folks, that's what dying is all about!

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
(Laughter)

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
You stop breathing, and then you're dead.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
It's that simple.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
And that's the kind of information they're going to bring back to you?

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
I don't think so.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Now, these people will make guesses, they'll say things like,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
"Why am I getting electricity?

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
He's saying to me, 'Electricity.'

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Was he an electrician?" "No."

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
"Did he ever have an electric razor?" "No."

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
It was a game of hunting questions like this.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
This is what they go through.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Now, folks often ask us

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
at the James Randi Educational Foundation,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
they call me, they say, "Why are you so concerned about this, Mr. Randi?

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Isn't it just a lot of fun?"

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
No, it is not fun. It is a cruel farce.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Now, it may bring a certain amount of comfort,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
but that comfort lasts

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
only about 20 minutes or so.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
And then the people look in the mirror, and they say,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
I just paid a lot of money for that reading.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And what did she say to me? 'I love you!'"

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
They always say that.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
They don't get any information,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
they don't get any value for what they spend.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Now, Sylvia Browne is the big operator.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
We call her "The Talons."

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Sylvia Browne -- thank you --

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Sylvia Browne is the big operator

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
in this field at this very moment.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Now, Sylvia Browne -- just to show you --

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
she actually gets 700 dollars

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
for a 20 minute reading over the telephone,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
she doesn't even go there in person,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
and you have to wait up to two years because

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
she's booked ahead that amount of time.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
You pay by credit card or whatever,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
and then she will call you

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
sometime in the next two years.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
You can tell it's her. "Hello, this is Sylvia Browne."

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
That's her, you can tell right away.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Now, Montel Williams is an intelligent man.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
We all know who he is on television.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
He's well educated, he's smart,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
he knows what Sylvia Browne is doing

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
but he doesn't give a damn.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
He just doesn't care.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Because, the bottom line is, the sponsors love it,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
and he will expose her

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
to television publicity all the time.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Now, what does Sylvia Browne give you for that 700 dollars?

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
She gives you the names of your guardian angels, that's first.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Now, without that, how could we possibly function? (Laughter)

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
She gives you the names of previous lives,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
who you were in previous lives.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Duh.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
It turns out that the women

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
that she gives readings for

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
were all Babylonian princesses, or something like that.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
And the men were all Grecian warriors

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
fighting with Agamemnon.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Nothing is ever said about

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
a 14 year-old bootblack in the streets of London

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
who died of consumption.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
He isn't worth bringing back, obviously.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
And the strange thing -- folks, you may have noticed this too.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
You see these folks on television --

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
they never call anybody back from hell. (Laughter)

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Everyone comes back from heaven, but never from hell.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
If they call back any of my friends,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
they're not going to... Well, you see the story.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
(Laughter)

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Now, Sylvia Browne is an exception,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
an exception in one way,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
because the James Randi Educational Foundation, my foundation,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
offers a one million dollar prize in negotiable bonds.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Very simply won.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
All you have to do is prove any paranormal, occult

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
or supernatural event or power of any kind

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
under proper observing conditions.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
It's very easy, win the million dollars.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Sylvia Browne is an exception in that

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
she's the only professional psychic

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
in the whole world

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
that has accepted our challenge.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
She did this on the "Larry King Live" show on CNN

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
six and a half years ago.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
And we haven't heard from her since. Strange.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
She said that, first of all, that she didn't know how to contact me.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Duh.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
A professional psychic who speaks to dead people,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
she can't reach me?

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
(Laughter)

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
I'm alive, you may have noticed.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Well, pretty well anyway.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
She couldn't reach me. Now she says she doesn't want to reach me

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
because I'm a godless person.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
All the more reason to take the million dollars,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
wouldn't you think, Sylvia?

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Now these people need to be stopped, seriously now.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
They need to be stopped because this is a cruel farce.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
We get people coming to the foundation all the time.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
They're ruined financially and emotionally

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
because they've given their money and their faith

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
to these people.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Now, I popped some pills earlier.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
I have to explain that to you.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Homeopathy, let's find out what that's all about.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Hmm. You've heard of it.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
It's an alternative form of healing, right?

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Homeopathy actually consists -- and that's what this is.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
This is Calms Forte,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
32 caplets of sleeping pills! I forgot to tell you that.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
I just ingested

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
six and a half days worth of sleeping pills.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
(Laughter)

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Six and a half days, that certainly is a fatal dose.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
It says right on the back here,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
"In case of overdose,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
contact your poison control center immediately,"

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
and it gives an 800 number.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Keep your seats -- it's going to be okay.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
I don't really need it

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
because I've been doing this stunt

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
for audiences all over the world

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
for the last eight or 10 years,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
taking fatal doses of homeopathic sleeping pills.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Why don't they affect me?

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
(Laughter)

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
(Applause)

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
The answer may surprise you.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
What is homeopathy?

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
It's taking a medicine that really works

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
and diluting it down

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
well beyond Avogadro's limit.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Diluting it down to the point

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
where there's none of it left. (Laughter)

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Now folks, this is not

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
just a metaphor I'm going to give you now, it's true.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
It's exactly equivalent to taking

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
one 325 milligram aspirin tablet,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
throwing it into the middle of Lake Tahoe,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
and then stirring it up, obviously with a very big stick,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
and waiting two years or so

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
until the solution is homogeneous.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Then, when you get a headache,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
you take a sip of this water, and -- voila! -- it is gone.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
(Laughter)

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Now that is true. That is what homeopathy is all about.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
And another claim that they make -- you'll love this one --

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
the more dilute the medicine is, they say,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
the more powerful it is.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Now wait a minute, we heard about a guy in Florida.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
The poor man, he was on homeopathic medicine.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
He died of an overdose.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
He forgot to take his pill.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
(Laughter)

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Work on it. Work on it.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
It's a ridiculous thing. It is absolutely ridiculous.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
I don't know what we're doing,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
believing in all this nonsense over all these years.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Now, let me tell you,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
The James Randi Educational Foundation

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
is waving this very big carrot,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
but I must say, the fact that nobody

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
has taken us up on this offer

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
doesn't mean that the powers don't exist.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
They might, some place out there.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Maybe these people are just independently wealthy.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Well, with Sylvia Browne I would think so.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
You know, 700 dollars for a 20 minute reading

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
over the telephone --

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
that's more than lawyers make!

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
I mean that's a fabulous amount of money.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
These people don't need the million dollars perhaps,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
but wouldn't you think they'd like to take it

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
just to make me look silly?

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Just to get rid of this godless person out there

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
that Sylvia Browne talks about all the time?

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
I think that something needs to be done about this.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
We really would love to have suggestions from you folks

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
on how to contact federal, state

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
and local authorities

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
to get them to do something.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
If you find out -- now I understand.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
We've seen people, even today, speaking to us

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
about AIDS epidemics

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
and starving kids around the world

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
and impure water supplies that people have to suffer with.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Those are very important,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
critically important to us.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
And we must do something about those problems.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
But at the same time,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
as Arthur C. Clarke said,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
The rotting of the human mind,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
the business of believing in the paranormal and the occult

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
and the supernatural --

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
all of this total nonsense,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
this medieval thinking --

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
I think something should be done about that,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
and it all lies in education.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Largely, it's the media

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
who are to blame for this sort of thing.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
They shamelessly promote

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
all kinds of nonsense of this sort

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
because it pleases the sponsors.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
It's the bottom line, the dollar line.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
That's what they're looking at.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
We really must do something about this.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
I'm willing to take your suggestions,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
and I'm willing to have you

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
tune in to our webpage.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
It's www.randi.org.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Go in there and look at the archives,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
and you will begin to understand much more

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
of what I've been talking about today.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
You will see the records that we have.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
There's nothing like sitting in that library

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
and having a family appear there

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
and say that Mum gave away all the family fortune.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
She cashed in the CDs,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
she gave away the stocks and the certificates.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
That's really sad to hear,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
and it hasn't helped them one bit,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
hasn't solved any of their problems.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Yes, there could be a rotting of the American mind,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
and of the minds all the way around the earth,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
if we don't start to think sensibly about these things.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Now, we've offered this carrot,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
as I say, we've dangled the carrot.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
We're waiting for the psychics to come forth and snap at it.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Oh, we get lots of them,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
hundreds of them every year come by.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
These are dowsers and people

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
who think that they can talk to the dead as well,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
but they're amateurs; they don't know how to evaluate

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
their own so-called powers.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
The professionals never come near us,

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
except in that case of Sylvia Browne

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
that I told you about a moment ago.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
She did accept and then backed away.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
I'm James Randi,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
and I'm waiting.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Thank you.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
(Applause)
