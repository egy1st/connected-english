00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The greatest irony in global health

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
is that the poorest countries

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
carry the largest disease burden.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
If we resize the countries of the globe

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
in proportion to the subject of interest,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
we see that Sub-Saharan Africa

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
is the worst hit region by HIV/AIDS.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This is the most devastating epidemic of our time.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We also see that this region

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
has the least capability in terms of dealing with the disease.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
There are very few doctors

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and, quite frankly, these countries do not have the resources

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
that are needed to cope

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
with such epidemics.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So what the Western countries,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
developed countries, have generously done

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
is they have proposed to provide free drugs

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
to all people in Third World countries

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
who actually can't afford these medications.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And this has already saved millions of lives,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and it has prevented entire economies

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
from capsizing in Sub-Saharan Africa.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
But there is a fundamental problem

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
that is killing the efforts

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
in fighting this disease,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
because if you keep throwing

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
drugs out at people

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
who don't have diagnostic services,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
you end up creating a problem of drug resistance.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
This is already beginning to happen in Sub-Saharan Africa.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
The problem is that,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
what begins as a tragedy in the Third World

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
could easily become a global problem.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And the last thing we want to see

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
is drug-resistant strains of HIV

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
popping up all over the world,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
because it will make treatment more expensive

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and it could also restore

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
the pre-ARV carnage of HIV/AIDS.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I experienced this firsthand

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
as a high school student in Uganda.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
This was in the 90s

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
during the peak of the HIV epidemic,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
before there were any ARVs in Sub-Saharan Africa.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And during that time, I actually lost more relatives,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
as well as the teachers who taught me,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
to HIV/AIDS.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So this became one of the driving passions of my life,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
to help find real solutions

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
that could address these kinds of problems.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
We all know about the miracle of miniaturization.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Back in the day, computers used to fill this entire room,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and people actually used to work inside the computers.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
But what electronic miniaturization has done

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
is that it has allowed people to shrink

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
technology into a cell phone.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And I'm sure everyone here enjoys cell phones

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
that can actually be used in the remote areas of the world,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
in the Third World countries.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
The good news is that the same technology

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
that allowed miniaturization of electronics

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
is now allowing us to miniaturize

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
biological laboratories.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
So, right now, we can actually miniaturize

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
biological and chemistry laboratories

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
onto microfluidic chips.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I was very lucky to come

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
to the US right after high school,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
and was able to work on this technology

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and develop some devices.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
This is a microfluidic chip that I developed.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
A close look at how the technology works:

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
These are channels that are about the size of a human hair --

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
so you have integrated valves, pumps, mixers and injectors --

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
so you can fit entire diagnostic experiments

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
onto a microfluidic system.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
So what I plan to do with this technology

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
is to actually take the current state

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
of the technology

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and build an HIV kit

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
in a microfluidic system.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
So, with one microfluidic chip,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
which is the size of an iPhone,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
you can actually diagnose

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
100 patients at the same time.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
For each patient, we will be able to do

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
up to 100 different viral loads per patient.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And this is only done in four hours,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
50 times faster than the current state of the art,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
at a cost that will be five to 500 times cheaper

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
than the current options.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
So this will allow us to create

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
personalized medicines in the Third World

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
at a cost that is actually achievable

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
and make the world a safer place.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
I invite your interest

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
as well as your involvement

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
in driving this vision

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
to a point of practical reality.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Thank you very much.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
(Applause)
