00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Several years ago here at TED, Peter Skillman

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
introduced a design challenge

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
called the marshmallow challenge.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And the idea's pretty simple:

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Teams of four have to build the tallest free-standing structure

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
out of 20 sticks of spaghetti,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
one yard of tape, one yard of string

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and a marshmallow.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The marshmallow has to be on top.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And, though it seems really simple, it's actually pretty hard

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
because it forces people

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
to collaborate very quickly.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And so, I thought this was an interesting idea,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and I incorporated it into a design workshop.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And it was a huge success.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And since then, I've conducted

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
about 70 design workshops across the world

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
with students and designers and architects,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
even the CTOs of the Fortune 50,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and there's something about this exercise

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
that reveals very deep lessons

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
about the nature of collaboration,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and I'd like to share some of them with you.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So, normally, most people begin

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
by orienting themselves to the task.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
They talk about it, they figure out what it's going to look like,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
they jockey for power.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Then they spend some time planning, organizing,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
they sketch and they lay out spaghetti.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
They spend the majority of their time

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
assembling the sticks into ever-growing structures.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And then finally, just as they're running out of time,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
someone takes out the marshmallow,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and then they gingerly put it on top,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and then they stand back, and -- ta-da! --

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
they admire their work.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
But what really happens, most of the time,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
is that the "ta-da" turns into an "uh-oh,"

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
because the weight of the marshmallow causes the entire structure

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
to buckle and to collapse.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
So there are a number of people

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
who have a lot more "uh-oh" moments than others,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and among the worst are recent graduates of business school.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
(Laughter)

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
They lie, they cheat, they get distracted

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and they produce really lame structures.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And of course there are teams

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
that have a lot more "ta-da" structures,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and among the best are recent graduates of kindergarten.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
(Laughter)

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And it's pretty amazing.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
As Peter tells us,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
not only do they produce the tallest structures,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
but they're the most interesting structures of them all.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
So the question you want to ask is:

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
How come? Why? What is it about them?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And Peter likes to say that

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
none of the kids spend any time

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
trying to be CEO of Spaghetti, Inc. Right?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
They don't spend time jockeying for power.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
But there's another reason as well.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And the reason is that business students are trained

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
to find the single right plan, right?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And then they execute on it.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And then what happens is, when they put the marshmallow on the top,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
they run out of time and what happens?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
It's a crisis.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Sound familiar? Right.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
What kindergarteners do differently

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
is that they start with the marshmallow,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and they build prototypes, successive prototypes,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
always keeping the marshmallow on top,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototypes along the way.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Designers recognize this type of collaboration

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
as the essence of the iterative process.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And with each version, kids get instant feedback

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
about what works and what doesn't work.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
So the capacity to play in prototype is really essential,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
but let's look at how different teams perform.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
So the average for most people is around 20 inches;

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
business schools students, about half of that;

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
lawyers, a little better, but not much better than that,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
kindergarteners, better than most adults.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Who does the very best?

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Architects and engineers, thankfully.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
(Laughter)

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Thirty-nine inches is the tallest structure I've seen.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And why is it? Because they understand triangles

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
and self-reinforcing geometrical patterns

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
are the key to building

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
stable structures.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
So CEOs, a little bit better than average,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
but here's where it gets interesting.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
If you put you put an executive admin. on the team,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
they get significantly better.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
(Laughter)

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
It's incredible. You know, you look around, you go, "Oh, that team's going to win."

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
You can just tell beforehand. And why is that?

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Because they have special skills

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
of facilitation.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
They manage the process, they understand the process.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And any team who manages

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and pays close attention to work

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
will significantly improve the team's performance.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Specialized skills and facilitation skills

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
are the combination that leads to strong success.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
If you have 10 teams that typically perform,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
you'll get maybe six or so that have standing structures.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And I tried something interesting.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
I thought, let's up the ante, once.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
So I offered a 10,000 dollar prize of software to the winning team.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
So what do you think happened to these design students?

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
What was the result?

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Here's what happened:

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Not one team had a standing structure.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
If anyone had built, say, a one inch structure,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
they would have taken home the prize.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
So, isn't that interesting? That high stakes

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
have a strong impact.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
We did the exercise again with the same students.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
What do you think happened then?

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
So now they understand the value of prototyping.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
So the same team went from being the very worst

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
to being among the very best.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
They produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
So there's deep lessons for us

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
about the nature of incentives and success.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
So, you might ask: Why would anyone

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
actually spend time writing a marshmallow challenge?

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And the reason is, I help create

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
digital tools and processes

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
to help teams build cars and video games

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
and visual effects.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And what the marshmallow challenge does

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
is it helps them identify the hidden assumptions.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Because, frankly,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
every project has its own marshmallow, doesn't it?

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
The challenge provides a shared experience,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
a common language,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
a common stance to build the right prototype.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
And so, this is the value of the experience,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
of this so simple exercise.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And those of you who are interested

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
may want to go to MarshmallowChallenge.com.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
It's a blog that you can look at

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
how to build the marshmallows.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
There's step-by-step instructions on this.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
There are crazy examples from around the world

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
of how people tweak and adjust the system.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
There's world records that are on this as well.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
And the fundamental lesson, I believe,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
is that design truly is

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
a contact sport.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
It demands that we bring all of our senses to the task,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
and that we apply the very best of our thinking,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
our feeling and our doing

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
to the challenge that we have at hand.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
And sometimes, a little prototype of this experience

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
is all that it takes to turn us

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
from an "uh-oh" moment to a "ta-da" moment.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
And that can make a big difference.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Thank you very much.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
(Applause)
