00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
One of the things that

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
defines a TEDster

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
is you've taken your passion,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and you've turned it into stewardship.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
You actually put action to the issues you care about.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
But what you're going to find eventually is

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
you may need to actually get elected officials

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
to help you out.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So, how do you do that?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
One of the things I should probably tell you is,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I worked for the Discovery Channel early in my career,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and that sort of warped my framework.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So, when you start to think about politicians,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
you've got to realize these are strange creatures.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Other than the fact that they can't tell directions,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and they have very strange breeding habits,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
how do you actually work with these things? (Laughter)

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
What we need to understand is:

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
What drives the political creature?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And there are two things that are primary in a politician's heart:

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
One is reputation and influence.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
These are the primary tools by which

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
a politician can do his job.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The second one -- unlike most animals,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
which is survival of the species --

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
this is preservation of self.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Now you may think it's money,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
but that's actually sort of a proxy

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
to what I can do to preserve myself.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Now, the challenge with you moving your issue forward

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
is these animals are getting broadcast to all the time.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
So, what doesn't work, in terms of getting your issue to be important?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
You can send them an email.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Well, unfortunately, I've got so many

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Viagra ads coming at me,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
your email is lost.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
It doesn't matter, it's spam.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
How about you get on the phone?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Well, chances are I've got a droid who's picking up the phone,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
"Yes, they called, and they said they didn't like it."

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
That doesn't move.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Face to face would work,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
but it's hard to set it up.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
It's hard to get the context and actually get the communication to work.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Yes, contributions actually do make a difference

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and they set a context for having a conversation,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
but it takes some time to build up.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
So what actually works?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And the answer is rather strange.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
It's a letter.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
We live in a digital world,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
but we're fairly analog creatures.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Letters actually work.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Even the top dog himself

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
takes time every day to read 10 letters

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
that are picked out by staff.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I can tell you that every official that I've ever worked with

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
will tell you about the letters they get

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and what they mean.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
So, how are you going to write your letter?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
First of all, you're going to pick up an analog device: a pen.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I know these are tough, and you may have a hard time

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
getting your hand bent around it, (Laughter)

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
but this is actually critical.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And it is critical that

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
you actually handwrite your letter.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
It is so novel to see this,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
that somebody actually picked up an analog device

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and has written to me.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Second of all, I'm going to recommend that

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
you get into a proactive stance

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and write to your elected officials at least once a month.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Here's my promise to you:

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
If you are consistent and do this,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
within three months the elected official will start calling you

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
when that issue comes up and say, "What do you think?"

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Now, I'm going to give you

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
a four paragraph format to work with.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Now, when you approach these animals,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
you need to understand there's a dangerous end to them,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
and you also need to approach them

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
with some level of respect and a little bit of wariness.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
So in paragraph number one,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
what I'm going to tell you to do is very simply this:

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
You appreciate them.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
You may not appreciate the person, you may not appreciate anything else,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
but maybe you appreciate the fact that they've got a tough gig.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
When animals are going to make a point, they make the point.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
They don't spend a lot of time dicking around.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
So, here you go. (Laughter)

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Paragraph number two:

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
You may actually have to just get very blunt

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and say what's really on your mind.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
When you do this,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
don't attack people;

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
you attack tactics.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Ad hominem attacks will get you nowhere.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Paragraph number three:

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
When animals are attacked or cornered,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
they will fight to the death,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
so you have to give them an exit.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Most of the time, if they have an exit strategy, they should take it.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
"Obviously, you're intelligent.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
If you had the right information,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
you would have done the right thing." (Laughter)

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Lastly, you want to be the nurturing agent.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
You're the safe place to come in to.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
So, in paragraph number four,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
you're going to tell people,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
"If no one is providing you with this information, let me help." (Laughter)

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Animals do displays. They do two things:

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
They warn you or they try to attract you

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
and say, "We need to mate."

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
You're going to do that by the way you sign your letter.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
You do a number of things: you're a vice president,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
you volunteer, you do something else.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Why is is this important?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Because this establishes the two

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
primary criteria for the political creature:

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
that you have influence in a large sphere,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
and that my preservation depends on you.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Here is one very quick hack,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
especially for the feds in the audience.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Here's how you mail your letter.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
First of all, you send the original to the district office.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
So, you send the copy to the main office.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
If they follow protocol, they'll pick up the phone and say, "Hey, do you have the original?"

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Then some droid in the back puts the name on a tickler

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
and says, "Oh, this is an important letter."

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And you actually get into the folder

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
that the elected official actually has to read.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
So, what your letter means:

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
I've got to tell you, we are all in a party,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and political officials are the pinatas.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
(Laughter)

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
We are harangued, lectured to,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
sold, marketed,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
but a letter is actually one of the few times

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
that we have honest communication.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
I got this letter when I was first elected,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
and I still carry it to

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
every council meeting I go to.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
This is an opportunity at real dialogue,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
and if you have stewardship

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
and want to communicate,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
that dialogue is incredibly powerful.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
So when you do that, here's what I can promise:

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
You're going to be the 800 pound gorilla in the forest.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Get writing.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
(Applause)
