00:00:00.708 --> 00:00:04.705
As someone who has spent his entire career trying to be invisible

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
standing in front of an audience is a cross between

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
an out-of-body experience and a deer caught in the headlights,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
so please forgive me for violating one of the TED commandments

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
by relying on words on paper,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and I only hope I'm not struck by lightning bolts before I'm done.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I'd like to begin by talking about some of the ideas that motivated me

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
to become a documentary photographer.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I was a student in the '60s, a time of social upheaval and questioning,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and on a personal level, an awakening sense of idealism.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
The war in Vietnam was raging;

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
the Civil Rights Movement was under way;

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and pictures had a powerful influence on me.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Our political and military leaders were telling us one thing,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and photographers were telling us another.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I believed the photographers, and so did millions of other Americans.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Their images fueled resistance to the war and to racism.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
They not only recorded history; they helped change the course of history.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Their pictures became part of our collective consciousness

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and, as consciousness evolved into a shared sense of conscience,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
change became not only possible, but inevitable.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I saw that the free flow of information represented by journalism,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
specifically visual journalism, can bring into focus

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
both the benefits and the cost of political policies.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
It can give credit to sound decision-making, adding momentum to success.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
In the face of poor political judgment or political inaction,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
it becomes a kind of intervention, assessing the damage

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and asking us to reassess our behavior.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
It puts a human face on issues

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
which from afar can appear abstract

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
or ideological or monumental in their global impact.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
What happens at ground level, far from the halls of power,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
happens to ordinary citizens one by one.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And I understood that documentary photography

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
has the ability to interpret events from their point of view.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
It gives a voice to those who otherwise would not have a voice.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And as a reaction, it stimulates public opinion

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and gives impetus to public debate,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
thereby preventing the interested parties

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
from totally controlling the agenda, much as they would like to.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Coming of age in those days made real

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
the concept that the free flow of information is absolutely vital

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
for a free and dynamic society to function properly.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
The press is certainly a business, and in order to survive

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
it must be a successful business,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
but the right balance must be found

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
between marketing considerations and journalistic responsibility.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Society's problems can't be solved until they're identified.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
On a higher plane, the press is a service industry,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and the service it provides is awareness.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Every story does not have to sell something.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
There's also a time to give.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
That was a tradition I wanted to follow.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Seeing the war created such incredibly high stakes for everyone involved

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
and that visual journalism could actually become a factor in conflict resolution --

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
I wanted to be a photographer in order to be a war photographer.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
But I was driven by an inherent sense

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
that a picture that revealed the true face of war

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
would almost by definition be an anti-war photograph.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
I'd like to take you on a visual journey through some of the events

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and issues I've been involved in over the past 25 years.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
In 1981, I went to Northern Ireland.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
10 IRA prisoners were in the process of starving themselves to death

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
in protest against conditions in jail.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
The reaction on the streets was violent confrontation.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
I saw that the front lines of contemporary wars

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
are not on isolated battlefields, but right where people live.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
During the early '80s, I spent a lot of time in Central America,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
which was engulfed by civil wars

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
that straddled the ideological divide of the Cold War.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
In Guatemala, the central government --

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
controlled by a oligarchy of European decent --

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
was waging a scorched Earth campaign against an indigenous rebellion,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
and I saw an image that reflected the history of Latin America:

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
conquest through a combination of the Bible and the sword.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
An anti-Sandinista guerrilla was mortally wounded

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
as Commander Zero attacked a town in Southern Nicaragua.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
A destroyed tank belonging to Somoza's national guard

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
was left as a monument in a park in Managua,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
and was transformed by the energy and spirit of a child.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
At the same time, a civil war was taking place in El Salvador,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
and again, the civilian population was caught up in the conflict.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
I've been covering the Palestinian-Israeli conflict since 1981.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
This is a moment from the beginning of the second intifada, in 2000,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
when it was still stones and Molotovs against an army.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
In 2001, the uprising escalated into an armed conflict,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
and one of the major incidents was

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
the destruction of the Palestinian refugee camp

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
in the West Bank town of Jenin.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Without the political will to find common ground,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
the continual friction of tactic and counter-tactic

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
only creates suspicion and hatred and vengeance,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and perpetuates the cycle of violence.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
In the '90s, after the breakup of the Soviet Union,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Yugoslavia fractured along ethnic fault lines, and civil war broke out

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
between Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
This is a scene of house-to-house fighting in Mostar,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
neighbor against neighbor.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
A bedroom, the place where people share intimacy,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
where life itself is conceived, became a battlefield.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000
A mosque in northern Bosnia was destroyed by Serbian artillery

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
and was used as a makeshift morgue.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Dead Serbian soldiers were collected after a battle

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
and used as barter for the return of prisoners

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
or Bosnian soldiers killed in action.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
This was once a park.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
The Bosnian soldier who guided me

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
told me that all of his friends were there now.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
At the same time in South Africa,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
after Nelson Mandela had been released from prison,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
the black population commenced the final phase

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
of liberation from apartheid.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
One of the things I had to learn as a journalist

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
was what to do with my anger.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000
I had to use it, channel its energy, turn it into something

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
that would clarify my vision, instead of clouding it.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000
In Transkei, I witnessed a rite of passage into manhood, of the Xhosa tribe.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Teenage boys lived in isolation, their bodies covered with white clay.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
After several weeks, they washed off the white

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
and took on the full responsibilities of men.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.600
It was a very old ritual that seemed symbolic

00:07:23.615 --> 00:07:28.000
of the political struggle that was changing the face of South Africa.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Children in Soweto playing on a trampoline.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Elsewhere in Africa there was famine.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
In Somalia, the central government collapsed and clan warfare broke out.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Farmers were driven off their land,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
and crops and livestock were destroyed or stolen.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Starvation was being used as a weapon of mass destruction --

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
primitive but extremely effective.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Hundreds of thousands of people were exterminated,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
slowly and painfully.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
The international community responded with massive humanitarian relief,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
and hundreds of thousands of more lives were saved.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
American troops were sent to protect the relief shipments,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
but they were eventually drawn into the conflict,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
and after the tragic battle in Mogadishu, they were withdrawn.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
In southern Sudan, another civil war saw similar use of starvation

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
as a means of genocide.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Again, international NGOs, united under the umbrella of the U.N.,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
staged a massive relief operation and thousands of lives were saved.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.000
I'm a witness, and I want my testimony to be honest and uncensored.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
I also want it to be powerful and eloquent,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
and to do as much justice as possible

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
to the experience of the people I'm photographing.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
This man was in an NGO feeding center,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
being helped as much as he could be helped.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
He literally had nothing. He was a virtual skeleton,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
yet he could still summon the courage and the will to move.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
He had not given up, and if he didn't give up,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:16.000
how could anyone in the outside world ever dream of losing hope?

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
In 1994, after three months of covering the South African election,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
I saw the inauguration of Nelson Mandela,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
and it was the most uplifting thing I've ever seen.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
It exemplified the best that humanity has to offer.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
The next day I left for Rwanda,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
and it was like taking the express elevator to hell.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000
This man had just been liberated from a Hutu death camp.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000
He allowed me to photograph him for quite a long time,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
and he even turned his face toward the light,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
as if he wanted me to see him better.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
I think he knew what the scars on his face would say to the rest of the world.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
This time, maybe confused or discouraged

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
by the military disaster in Somalia,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
the international community remained silent,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
and somewhere around 800,000 people were slaughtered

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
by their own countrymen -- sometimes their own neighbors --

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
using farm implements as weapons.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.646
Perhaps because a lesson had been learned

00:10:18.662 --> 00:10:21.000
by the weak response to the war in Bosnia

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
and the failure in Rwanda,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
when Serbia attacked Kosovo,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.692
international action was taken much more decisively.

00:10:28.692 --> 00:10:33.000
NATO forces went in, and the Serbian army withdrew.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.723
Ethnic Albanians had been murdered,

00:10:35.723 --> 00:10:40.000
their farms destroyed and a huge number of people forcibly deported.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
They were received in refugee camps

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
set up by NGOs in Albania and Macedonia.

00:10:48.538 --> 00:10:52.000
The imprint of a man who had been burned inside his own home.

00:10:52.585 --> 00:10:55.554
The image reminded me of a cave painting,

00:10:55.554 --> 00:11:00.000
and echoed how primitive we still are in so many ways.

00:11:01.477 --> 00:11:05.523
Between 1995 and '96, I covered the first two wars

00:11:05.523 --> 00:11:08.000
in Chechnya from inside Grozny.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000
This is a Chechen rebel on the front line against the Russian army.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.646
The Russians bombarded Grozny constantly for weeks,

00:11:17.646 --> 00:11:21.000
killing mainly the civilians who were still trapped inside.

00:11:22.169 --> 00:11:24.477
I found a boy from the local orphanage

00:11:24.477 --> 00:11:27.000
wandering around the front line.

00:11:28.308 --> 00:11:32.000
My work has evolved from being concerned mainly with war

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.692
to a focus on critical social issues as well.

00:11:36.277 --> 00:11:39.000
After the fall of Ceausescu, I went to Romania

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
and discovered a kind of gulag of children,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
where thousands of orphans were being kept in medieval conditions.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Ceausescu had imposed a quota

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
on the number of children to be produced by each family,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
thereby making women's bodies an instrument of state economic policy.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Children who couldn't be supported by their families

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
were raised in government orphanages.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Children with birth defects were labeled incurables,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
and confined for life to inhuman conditions.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000
As reports began to surface, again international aid went in.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Going deeper into the legacy of the Eastern European regimes,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
I worked for several months on a story about the effects of industrial pollution,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
where there had been no regard for the environment

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
or the health of either workers or the general population.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
An aluminum factory in Czechoslovakia

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
was filled with carcinogenic smoke and dust,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
and four out of five workers came down with cancer.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.662
After the fall of Suharto in Indonesia,

00:12:44.662 --> 00:12:47.431
I began to explore conditions of poverty

00:12:47.431 --> 00:12:50.662
in a country that was on its way towards modernization.

00:12:50.662 --> 00:12:54.000
I spent a good deal of time with a man

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
who lived with his family on a railway embankment

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
and had lost an arm and a leg in a train accident.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000
When the story was published, unsolicited donations poured in.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
A trust fund was established,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
and the family now lives in a house in the countryside

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
and all their basic necessities are taken care of.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
It was a story that wasn't trying to sell anything.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Journalism had provided a channel

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000
for people's natural sense of generosity, and the readers responded.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
I met a band of homeless children who'd come to Jakarta from the countryside,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
and ended up living in a train station.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000
By the age of 12 or 14, they'd become beggars and drug addicts.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
The rural poor had become the urban poor,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
and in the process, they'd become invisible.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.600
These heroin addicts in detox in Pakistan

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.492
reminded me of figures in a play by Beckett:

00:13:49.492 --> 00:13:53.000
isolated, waiting in the dark, but drawn to the light.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.185
Agent Orange was a defoliant used during the Vietnam War

00:14:00.185 --> 00:14:04.123
to deny cover to the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese army.

00:14:04.123 --> 00:14:09.000
The active ingredient was dioxin, an extremely toxic chemical

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
that was sprayed in vast quantities,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
and whose effects passed through the genes to the next generation.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.662
In 2000, I began documenting global health issues,

00:14:19.662 --> 00:14:22.831
concentrating first on AIDS in Africa.

00:14:22.831 --> 00:14:26.000
I tried to tell the story through the work of caregivers.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
I thought it was important to emphasize that people were being helped,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.446
whether by international NGOs or by local grassroots organizations.

00:14:34.446 --> 00:14:37.000
So many children have been orphaned by the epidemic

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
that grandmothers have taken the place of parents,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
and a lot of children had been born with HIV.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
A hospital in Zambia.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
I began documenting the close connection

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
between HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
This is an MSF hospital in Cambodia.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.338
My pictures can play a supporting role to the work of NGOs

00:15:05.338 --> 00:15:10.000
by shedding light on the critical social problems they're trying to deal with.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
I went to Congo with MSF,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
and contributed to a book and an exhibition

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
that focused attention on a forgotten war

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
in which millions of people have died,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
and exposure to disease without treatment is used as a weapon.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
A malnourished child being measured

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
as part of the supplemental feeding program.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
In the fall of 2004 I went to Darfur.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
This time I was on assignment for a magazine,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
but again worked closely with MSF.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
The international community still hasn't found a way

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
to create the pressure necessary to stop this genocide.

00:15:47.062 --> 00:15:51.000
An MSF hospital in a camp for displaced people.

00:15:52.354 --> 00:15:57.000
I've been working on a long project on crime and punishment in America.

00:15:57.169 --> 00:16:00.000
This is a scene from New Orleans.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.338
A prisoner on a chain gang in Alabama

00:16:04.338 --> 00:16:08.000
was punished by being handcuffed to a post in the midday sun.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
This experience raised a lot of questions,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
among them questions about race and equality

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.000
and for whom in our country opportunities and options are available.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
In the yard of a chain gang in Alabama.

00:16:26.277 --> 00:16:28.431
I didn't see either of the planes hit,

00:16:28.431 --> 00:16:32.000
and when I glanced out my window, I saw the first tower burning,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
and I thought it might have been an accident.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
A few minutes later when I looked again

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
and saw the second tower burning, I knew we were at war.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
In the midst of the wreckage at Ground Zero, I had a realization.

00:16:45.215 --> 00:16:50.000
I'd been photographing in the Islamic world since 1981 --

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.646
not only in the Middle East, but also in Africa, Asia and Europe.

00:16:54.646 --> 00:16:57.615
At the time I was photographing in these different places,

00:16:57.615 --> 00:16:59.646
I thought I was covering separate stories,

00:16:59.646 --> 00:17:03.000
but on 9/11 history crystallized, and I understood

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.246
I'd actually been covering a single story for more than 20 years,

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:11.000
and the attack on New York was its latest manifestation.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
The central commercial district of Kabul, Afghanistan

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
at the end of the civil war,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
shortly before the city fell to the Taliban.

00:17:22.385 --> 00:17:25.000
Land mine victims being helped

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
at the Red Cross rehab center being run by Alberto Cairo.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.615
A boy who lost a leg to a leftover mine.

00:17:32.615 --> 00:17:36.000
I'd witnessed immense suffering in the Islamic world

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.000
from political oppression, civil war, foreign invasions, poverty, famine.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
I understood that in its suffering,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000
the Islamic world had been crying out. Why weren't we listening?

00:17:50.631 --> 00:17:53.000
A Taliban fighter shot during a battle

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
as the Northern Alliance entered the city of Kunduz.

00:18:02.738 --> 00:18:05.000
When war with Iraq was imminent,

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
I realized the American troops would be very well covered,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
so I decided to cover the invasion from inside Baghdad.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
A marketplace was hit by a mortar shell

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
that killed several members of a single family.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
A day after American forces entered Baghdad,

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
a company of Marines began rounding up bank robbers

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
and were cheered on by the crowds --

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
a hopeful moment that was short lived.

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.369
For the first time in years,

00:18:37.369 --> 00:18:39.692
Shi'ites were allowed to make the pilgrimage

00:18:39.692 --> 00:18:42.000
to Karbala to observe Ashura,

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.585
and I was amazed by the sheer number of people

00:18:44.585 --> 00:18:47.000
and how fervently they practiced their religion.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
A group of men march through the streets cutting themselves with knives.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000
It was obvious that the Shi'ites were a force to be reckoned with,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000
and we would do well to understand them and learn how to deal with them.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.692
Last year I spent several months documenting our wounded troops,

00:19:07.692 --> 00:19:10.000
from the battlefield in Iraq all the way home.

00:19:11.246 --> 00:19:13.708
This is a helicopter medic giving CPR

00:19:13.708 --> 00:19:16.000
to a soldier who had been shot in the head.

00:19:18.062 --> 00:19:20.585
Military medicine has become so efficient

00:19:20.585 --> 00:19:24.400
that the percentage of troops who survive after being wounded

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:28.000
is much higher in this war than in any other war in our history.

00:19:29.646 --> 00:19:33.000
The signature weapon of the war is the IED,

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
and the signature wound is severe leg damage.

00:19:37.369 --> 00:19:40.569
After enduring extreme pain and trauma,

00:19:40.569 --> 00:19:43.000
the wounded face a grueling physical

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
and psychological struggle in rehab.

00:19:47.369 --> 00:19:51.000
The spirit they displayed was absolutely remarkable.

00:19:51.538 --> 00:19:54.000
I tried to imagine myself in their place,

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
and I was totally humbled by their courage and determination

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000
in the face of such catastrophic loss.

00:20:01.462 --> 00:20:07.000
Good people had been put in a very bad situation for questionable results.

00:20:09.492 --> 00:20:13.000
One day in rehab someone, started talking about surfing

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.338
and all these guys who'd never surfed before said, "Hey, let's go."

00:20:17.338 --> 00:20:19.000
And they went surfing.

00:20:22.585 --> 00:20:26.000
Photographers go to the extreme edges of human experience

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
to show people what's going on.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000
Sometimes they put their lives on the line,

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000
because they believe your opinions and your influence matter.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000
They aim their pictures at your best instincts,

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
generosity, a sense of right and wrong,

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000
the ability and the willingness to identify with others,

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
the refusal to accept the unacceptable.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
My TED wish:

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000
there's a vital story that needs to be told,

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
and I wish for TED to help me gain access to it

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.000
and then to help me come up with innovative and exciting ways

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000
to use news photography in the digital era.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
Thank you very much.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:25.000
(Applause)
