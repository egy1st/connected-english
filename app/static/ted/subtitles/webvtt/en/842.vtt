00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Salaam. Namaskar.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Good morning.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Given my TED profile, you might be expecting

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
that I'm going to speak to you about

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
the latest philanthropic trends --

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
the one that's currently got Wall Street

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and the World Bank buzzing --

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
how to invest in women,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
how to empower them, how to save them.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Not me.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I am interested in how women

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
are saving us.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
They're saving us by redefining and re-imagining

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
a future that defies and blurs

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
accepted polarities,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
polarities we've taken for granted for a long time,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
like the ones between modernity and tradition,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
First World and Third World,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
oppression and opportunity.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
In the midst of the daunting challenges

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
we face as a global community,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
there's something about

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
this third way raga

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
that is making my heart sing.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
What intrigues me most

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
is how women are doing this,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
despite a set of paradoxes

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
that are both frustrating and fascinating.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Why is it that women are, on the one hand,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
viciously oppressed by cultural practices,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and yet at the same time,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
are the preservers of cultures in most societies?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Is the hijab or the headscarf

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
a symbol of submission

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
or resistance?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
When so many women and girls

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
are beaten, raped, maimed

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
on a daily basis

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
in the name of all kinds of causes --

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
honor, religion, nationality --

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
what allows women to replant trees,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
to rebuild societies,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
to lead radical, non-violent movements

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
for social change?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Is it different women

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
who are doing the preserving and the radicalizing?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Or are they one and the same?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Are we guilty, as Chimamanda Adichie reminded us

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
at the TED conference in Oxford,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
of assuming that there is a single story

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
of women's struggles for their rights

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
while there are, in fact, many?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And what, if anything,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
do men have to do with it?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Much of my life has been a quest

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
to get some answers to these questions.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
It's taken me across the globe

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and introduced me to some amazing people.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
In the process, I've gathered a few fragments

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
that help me shed some light on this puzzle.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Among those who've helped open my eyes

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
to a third way

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
are: a devout Muslim in Afghanistan,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
a group of harmonizing lesbians in Croatia

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and a taboo breaker in Liberia.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I'm indebted to them,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
as I am to my parents,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
who for some set of misdemeanors in their last life,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
were blessed with three daughters in this one.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And for reasons equally unclear to me,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
seem to be inordinately proud of the three of us.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
I was born and raised here in India,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
and I learned from an early age

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
to be deeply suspicious of the aunties and uncles

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
who would bend down, pat us on the head

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
and then say to my parents

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
with no problem at all,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
"Poor things. You only have three daughters.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
But you're young, you could still try again."

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
My sense of outrage

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
about women's rights

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
was brought to a boil when I was about 11.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
My aunt, an incredibly articulate

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and brilliant woman,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
was widowed early.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
A flock of relatives descended on her.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
They took off her colorful sari.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
They made her wear a white one.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
They wiped her bindi off her forehead.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
They broke her bangles.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Her daughter, Rani,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
a few years older than me,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
sat in her lap bewildered,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
not knowing what had happened

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
to the confident woman

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
she once knew as her mother.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Late that night, I heard my mother

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
begging my father,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
"Please do something Ramu. Can't you intervene?"

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And my father, in a low voice, muttering,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
"I'm just the youngest brother, there's nothing I can do.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
This is tradition."

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
That's the night I learned the rules

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
about what it means to be female in this world.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Women don't make those rules,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
but they define us, and they define

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
our opportunities and our chances.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And men are affected by those rules too.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
My father, who had fought in three wars,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
could not save his own sister

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
from this suffering.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
By 18,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
under the excellent tutelage of my mother,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
I was therefore, as you might expect,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
defiantly feminist.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
On the streets chanting,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
"[Hindi]

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
[Hindi]

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
We are the women of India.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
We are not flowers, we are sparks of change."

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
By the time I got to Beijing in 1995,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
it was clear to me, the only way

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
to achieve gender equality

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
was to overturn centuries

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
of oppressive tradition.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Soon after I returned from Beijing,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
I leapt at the chance to work for this wonderful organization,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
founded by women,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
to support women's rights organizations around the globe.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
But barely six months into my new job,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
I met a woman

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
who forced me to challenge all my assumptions.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Her name is Sakena Yacoobi.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
She walked into my office

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
at a time when no one knew

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
where Afghanistan was in the United States.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
She said to me, "It is not about the burka."

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
She was the most determined advocate

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
for women's rights I had ever heard.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
She told me women were running underground schools

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
in her communities inside Afghanistan,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
and that her organization, the Afghan Institute of Learning,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
had started a school in Pakistan.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
She said, "The first thing anyone who is a Muslim knows

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
is that the Koran requires

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
and strongly supports literacy.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
The prophet wanted every believer

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
to be able to read the Koran for themselves."

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Had I heard right?

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Was a women's rights advocate

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
invoking religion?

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
But Sakena defies labels.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
She always wears a headscarf,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
but I've walked alongside with her on a beach

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
with her long hair flying in the breeze.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
She starts every lecture with a prayer,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
but she's a single, feisty,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
financially independent woman

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
in a country where girls are married off at the age of 12.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
She is also immensely pragmatic.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
"This headscarf and these clothes," she says,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
"give me the freedom to do what I need to do

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
to speak to those whose support and assistance

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
are critical for this work.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
When I had to open the school in the refugee camp,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
I went to see the imam.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
I told him, 'I'm a believer, and women and children

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
in these terrible conditions

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
need their faith to survive.'"

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
She smiles slyly.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
"He was flattered.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
He began to come twice a week to my center

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
because women could not go to the mosque.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And after he would leave,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
women and girls would stay behind.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
We began with a small literacy class

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
to read the Koran,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
then a math class, then an English class, then computer classes.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
In a few weeks, everyone in the refugee camp

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
was in our classes."

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Sakena is a teacher

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
at a time when to educate women

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
is a dangerous business in Afghanistan.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
She is on the Taliban's hit list.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
I worry about her every time she travels across that country.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
She shrugs when I ask her about safety.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
"Kavita jaan, we cannot allow ourselves to be afraid.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Look at those young girls who go back to school

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
when acid is thrown in their face."

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
And I smile, and I nod,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
realizing I'm watching women and girls

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
using their own religious traditions and practices,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
turning them into instruments

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
of opposition and opportunity.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Their path is their own

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
and it looks towards an Afghanistan

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
that will be different.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Being different is something the women

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
of Lesbor in Zagreb, Croatia

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
know all too well.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
To be a lesbian, a dyke,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
a homosexual

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
in most parts of the world, including right here

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
in our country, India,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
is to occupy a place of immense discomfort

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
and extreme prejudice.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
In post-conflict societies like Croatia,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
where a hyper-nationalism and religiosity

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
have created an environment unbearable

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
for anyone who might

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
be considered a social outcast.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
So enter a group of out dykes,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
young women who love the old music

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
that once spread across that region

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
from Macedonia to Bosnia,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
from Serbia to Slovenia.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
These folk singers met at college at a gender studies program.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Many are in their 20s, some are mothers.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Many have struggled to come out to their communities,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
in families whose religious beliefs make it hard to accept

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
that their daughters are not sick,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
just queer.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
As Leah, one of the founders of the group, says,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
"I like traditional music very much.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
I also like rock and roll.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
So Lesbor, we blend the two.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
I see traditional music like a kind of rebellion,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
in which people can really speak their voice,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
especially traditional songs

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
from other parts of the former Yugoslav Republic.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
After the war, lots of these songs were lost,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
but they are a part of our childhood and our history,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
and we should not forget them."

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Improbably, this LGBT singing choir

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
has demonstrated how women

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
are investing in tradition to create change,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
like alchemists turning discord into harmony.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Their repertoire includes

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
the Croatian national anthem,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
a Bosnian love song

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
and Serbian duets.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
And, Leah adds with a grin,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
"Kavita, we especially are proud of our Christmas music,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
because it shows we are open to religious practices

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
even though Catholic Church

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
hates us LGBT."

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Their concerts draw from

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
their own communities, yes,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
but also from an older generation:

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
a generation that might be

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
suspicious of homosexuality,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
but is nostalgic for its own music and the past it represents.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
One father, who had initially balked at his daughter

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
coming out in such a choir,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
now writes songs for them.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
In the Middle Ages, troubadours

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
would travel across the land

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
singing their tales and sharing their verses:

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Lesbor travels through the Balkans like this,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
singing, connecting people divided

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
by religion, nationality and language.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Bosnians, Croats and Serbs

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
find a rare shared space of pride in their history,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
and Lesbor reminds them that

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
the songs one group often claims as theirs alone

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
really belong to them all.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:55.000
(Singing)

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Yesterday, Mallika Sarabhai showed us

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
that music can create a world

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
more accepting of difference

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
than the one we have been given.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
The world Leymah Gbowee was given

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
was a world at war.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Liberia had been torn apart by civil strife for decades.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Leymah was not an activist, she was a mother of three.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
But she was sick with worry:

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
She worried her son would be abducted

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
and taken off to be a child soldier,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
she worried her daughters would be raped,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
she worried for their lives.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
One night, she had a dream.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
She dreamt she and thousands of other women

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
ended the bloodshed.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
The next morning at church, she asked others how they felt.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
They were all tired of the fighting.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
We need peace, and we need our leaders to know

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
we will not rest until there is peace.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Among Leymah's friends was a policewoman who was Muslim.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
She promised to raise the issue with her community.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
At the next Friday sermon,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
the women who were sitting in the side room of the mosque

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
began to share their distress at the state of affairs.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
"What does it matter?" they said, "A bullet doesn't distinguish

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
between a Muslim and a Christian."

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
This small group of women,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
determined to bring an end to the war,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
and they chose to use their traditions to make a point:

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Liberian women usually wear

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
lots of jewelry and colorful clothing.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
But no, for the protest, they dressed

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
all in white, no makeup.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
As Leymah said, "We wore the white

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
saying we were out for peace."

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
They stood on the side of the road on which

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Charles Taylor's motorcade passed every day.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
They stood for weeks --

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
first just 10, then 20, then 50, then hundreds of women --

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
wearing white, singing, dancing,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
saying they were out for peace.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Eventually, opposing forces in Liberia

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
were pushed to hold peace talks in Ghana.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
The peace talks dragged on and on and on.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Leymah and her sisters had had enough.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
With their remaining funds, they took

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
a small group of women down to the venue of the peace talks

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
and they surrounded the building.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
In a now famous CNN clip,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
you can see them sitting on the ground, their arms linked.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
We know this in India. It's called a [Hindi].

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Then things get tense.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
The police are called in to physically remove the women.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
As the senior officer approaches with a baton,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Leymah stands up with deliberation,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
reaches her arms up over her head,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
and begins, very slowly,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
to untie her headdress that covers her hair.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
You can see the policeman's face.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
He looks embarrassed. He backs away.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
And the next thing you know,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
the police have disappeared.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Leymah said to me later,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
"It's a taboo, you know, in West Africa.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
If an older woman undresses in front of a man

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
because she wants to,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
the man's family is cursed."

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
(Laughter)

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
(Applause)

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
She said, "I don't know if he did it because he believed,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
but he knew we were not going to leave.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
We were not going to leave until the peace accord was signed."

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
And the peace accord was signed.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
And the women of Liberia

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
then mobilized in support of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
a woman who broke a few taboos herself

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
becoming the first elected woman head of state

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
in Africa in years.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
When she made her presidential address,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
she acknowledged these brave women of Liberia

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
who allowed her to win against a football star --

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
that's soccer for you Americans --

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
no less.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Women like Sakena and Leah

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
and Leymah

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
have humbled me and changed me

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
and made me realize that I should not be so quick

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
to jump to assumptions of any kind.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
They've also saved me from my righteous anger

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
by offering insights into this third way.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
A Filipina activist once said to me,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
"How do you cook a rice cake?

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
With heat from the bottom and heat from the top."

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
The protests, the marches,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
the uncompromising position that

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
women's rights are human rights, full stop.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
That's the heat from the bottom.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
That's Malcolm X and the suffragists

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
and gay pride parades.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
But we also need the heat from the top.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
And in most parts of the world,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
that top is still

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
controlled by men.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
So to paraphrase Marx: Women make change,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
but not in circumstances of their own choosing.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
They have to negotiate.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
They have to subvert tradition that once silenced them

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
in order to give voice to new aspirations.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
And they need allies from their communities.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Allies like the imam,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
allies like the father who now writes songs

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
for a lesbian group in Croatia,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
allies like the policeman who honored a taboo and backed away,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
allies like my father,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
who couldn't help his sister but has helped three daughters

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
pursue their dreams.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Maybe this is because feminism,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
unlike almost every other social movement,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
is not a struggle against a distinct oppressor --

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
it's not the ruling class

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
or the occupiers or the colonizers --

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
it's against a deeply held set of beliefs and assumptions

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
that we women, far too often,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
hold ourselves.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
And perhaps this is the ultimate gift of feminism,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
that the personal is in fact the political.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
So that, as Eleanor Roosevelt said once of human rights,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
the same is true of gender equality:

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
that it starts in small places, close to home.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
On the streets, yes,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
but also in negotiations at the kitchen table

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
and in the marital bed

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
and in relationships between lovers and parents

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
and sisters and friends.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
And then

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
you realize that by integrating

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
aspects of tradition and community

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
into their struggles,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
women like Sakena and Leah and Leymah --

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
but also women like Sonia Gandhi here in India

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
and Michelle Bachelet in Chile

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
and Shirin Ebadi in Iran --

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
are doing something else.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
They're challenging the very notion

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
of Western models of development.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
They are saying, we don't have to be like you

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
to make change.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
We can wear a sari or a hijab

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
or pants or a boubou,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
and we can be party leaders and presidents

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
and human rights lawyers.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
We can use our tradition to navigate change.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
We can demilitarize societies

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
and pour resources, instead,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
into reservoirs of genuine security.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
It is in these little stories,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
these individual stories,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
that I see a radical epic being written

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
by women around the world.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
It is in these threads

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
that are being woven into a resilient fabric

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
that will sustain communities,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
that I find hope.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
And if my heart is singing,

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
it's because in these little fragments,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
every now and again, you catch a glimpse

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
of a whole, of a whole new world.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
And she is definitely on her way.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Thank you.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:16.000
(Applause)
