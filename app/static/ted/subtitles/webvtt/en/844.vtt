00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Hi, my name is Roz Savage

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and I row across oceans.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Four years ago, I rowed solo across the Atlantic,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and since then, I've done two out of three stages

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
across the Pacific,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
from San Francisco to Hawaii

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and from Hawaii to Kiribati.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And tomorrow, I'll be leaving this boat

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
to fly back to Kiribati

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
to continue with the third and final stage

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
of my row across the Pacific.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Cumulatively, I will have rowed

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
over 8,000 miles,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
taken over three million oar strokes

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and spent more than 312 days alone

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
on the ocean on a 23 foot rowboat.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
This has given me a very

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
special relationship with the ocean.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
We have a bit of a love/hate thing going on.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I feel a bit about it like I did about

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
a very strict math teacher that I once had at school.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I didn't always like her, but I did respect her,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and she taught me a heck of a lot.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So today I'd like to share with you

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
some of my ocean adventures

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and tell you a little bit about what they've taught me,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and how I think we can maybe take some of those lessons

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and apply them to this environmental challenge

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
that we face right now.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Now, some of you might be thinking,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
"Hold on a minute. She doesn't look very much like an ocean rower.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Isn't she meant to be about this tall

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and about this wide

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and maybe look a bit more like these guys?"

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
You'll notice, they've all got something that I don't.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Well, I don't know what you're thinking, but I'm talking about the beards. (Laughter)

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And no matter how long I've spent on the ocean,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I haven't yet managed to muster a decent beard,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and I hope that it remains that way.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
For a long time, I didn't believe that I could have a big adventure.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
The story that I told myself was

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
that adventurers looked like this.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I didn't look the part.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I thought there were them and there were us,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and I was not one of them.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
So for 11 years, I conformed.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I did what people from my kind of background were supposed to do.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I was working in an office in London

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
as a management consultant.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And I think I knew from day one that it wasn't the right job for me.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
But that kind of conditioning

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
just kept me there for so many years,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
until I reached my mid-30s and I thought,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
"You know, I'm not getting any younger.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I feel like I've got a purpose in this life, and I don't know what it is,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
but I'm pretty certain that management consultancy is not it.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
So, fast forward a few years.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I'd gone through some changes.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
To try and answer that question of,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
"What am I supposed to be doing with my life?"

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I sat down one day

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and wrote two versions of my own obituary,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
the one that I wanted, a life of adventure,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and the one that I was actually heading for

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
which was a nice, normal, pleasant life,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
but it wasn't where I wanted to be by the end of my life.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
I wanted to live a life that I could be proud of.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And I remember looking at these two versions of my obituary

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and thinking, "Oh boy,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I'm on totally the wrong track here.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
If I carry on living as I am now,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
I'm just not going to end up where I want to be

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
in five years, or 10 years,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
or at the end of my life."

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
I made a few changes,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
let go of some loose trappings of my old life,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
and through a bit of a leap of logic,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
decided to row across the Atlantic Ocean.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
(Laughter)

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
The Atlantic Rowing Race runs from the Canaries to Antigua,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
it's about 3,000 miles,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
and it turned out to be

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
the hardest thing I had ever done.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Sure, I had wanted to get outside of my comfort zone,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
but what I'd sort of failed to notice was that

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
getting out of your comfort zone is, by definition,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
extremely uncomfortable.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
And my timing was not great either:

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
2005, when I did the Atlantic,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
was the year of Hurricane Katrina.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
There were more tropical storms in the North Atlantic

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
than ever before, since records began.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And pretty early on,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
those storms started making their presence known.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
All four of my oars broke

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
before I reached halfway across.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Oars are not supposed to look like this.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
But what can you do? You're in the middle of the ocean.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Oars are your only means of propulsion.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
So I just had to look around the boat

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
and figure out what I was going to use

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
to fix up these oars so that I could carry on.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
So I found a boat hook and my trusty duct tape

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
and splintered the boat hook

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
to the oars to reinforce it.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Then, when that gave out,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
I sawed the wheel axles off my spare rowing seat

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
and used those.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
And then when those gave out, I cannibalized one of the broken oars.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
I'd never been very good at fixing stuff

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
when I was living my old life,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
but it's amazing how resourceful you can become

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
when you're in the middle of the ocean

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
and there's only one way to get to the other side.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
And the oars kind of became a symbol

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
of just in how many ways

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
I went beyond what I thought were my limits.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
I suffered from tendinitis on my shoulders

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and saltwater sores on my bottom.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
I really struggled psychologically,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
totally overwhelmed by the scale of the challenge,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
realizing that, if I carried on moving at two miles an hour,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
3,000 miles was going to

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
take me a very, very long time.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
There were so many times

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
when I thought I'd hit that limit,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
but had no choice but to just carry on

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
and try and figure out how I was going to get to the other side

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
without driving myself crazy.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
And eventually after

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
103 days at sea,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
I arrived in Antigua.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
I don't think I've ever felt so happy

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
in my entire life.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
It was a bit like finishing a marathon

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
and getting out of solitary confinement

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
and winning an Oscar all rolled into one.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
I was euphoric.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And to see all the people coming out to greet me

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
and standing along the cliff tops and clapping and cheering,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
I just felt like a movie star.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
It was absolutely wonderful.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
And I really learned then that, the bigger the challenge,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
the bigger the sense of achievement

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
when you get to the end of it.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
So this might be a good moment to take a quick time-out

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
to answer a few FAQs about ocean rowing

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
that might be going through your mind.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Number one that I get asked: What do you eat?

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
A few freeze-dried meals, but mostly I try and eat

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
much more unprocessed foods.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
So I grow my own beansprouts.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
I eat fruits and nut bars,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
a lot of nuts.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
And generally arrive about 30 pounds lighter

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
at the other end.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Question number two: How do you sleep?

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
With my eyes shut. Ha-ha.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
I suppose what you mean is:

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
What happens to the boat while I'm sleeping?

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Well, I plan my route so that I'm drifting

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
with the winds and the currents while I'm sleeping.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
On a good night, I think my best ever was 11 miles

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
in the right direction.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Worst ever, 13 miles in the wrong direction.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
That's a bad day at the office.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
What do I wear?

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Mostly, a baseball cap,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
rowing gloves and a smile -- or a frown,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
depending on whether I went backwards overnight --

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
and lots of sun lotion.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Do I have a chase boat?

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
No I don't. I'm totally self-supporting out there.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
I don't see anybody for the whole time

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
that I'm at sea, generally.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And finally: Am I crazy?

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Well, I leave that one up to you to judge.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
So, how do you top rowing across the Atlantic?

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Well, naturally, you decide to row across the Pacific.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Well, I thought the Atlantic was big,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
but the Pacific is really, really big.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
I think we tend to do it a little bit of a disservice in our usual maps.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
I don't know for sure that the Brits

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
invented this particular view of the world, but I suspect we might have done so:

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
we are right in the middle,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
and we've cut the Pacific in half

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
and flung it to the far corners of the world.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Whereas if you look in Google Earth,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
this is how the Pacific looks.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
It pretty much covers half the planet.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
You can just see a little bit of North America up here

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
and a sliver of Australia down there.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
It is really big --

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
65 million square miles --

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
and to row in a straight line across it

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
would be about 8,000 miles.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Unfortunately, ocean rowboats

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
very rarely go in a straight line.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
By the time I get to Australia,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
if I get to Australia,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
I will have rowed probably nine or 10,000 miles in all.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
So, because nobody in their straight mind would row

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
straight past Hawaii without dropping in,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
I decided to cut this very big undertaking

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
into three segments.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
The first attempt didn't go so well.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
In 2007, I did a rather involuntary capsize drill

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
three times in 24 hours.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
A bit like being in a washing machine.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Boat got a bit dinged up,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
so did I.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
I blogged about it. Unfortunately, somebody

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
with a bit of a hero complex decided that

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
this damsel was in distress and needed saving.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
The first I knew about this was when the Coast Guard plane turned up overhead.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
I tried to tell them to go away.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
We had a bit of a battle of wills.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
I lost and got airlifted.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Awful, really awful.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
It was one of the worst feelings of my life,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
as I was lifted up on that winch line into the helicopter

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
and looked down at my trusty little boat

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
rolling around in the 20 foot waves

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
and wondering if I would ever see her again.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
So I had to launch a very expensive

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
salvage operation

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
and then wait another nine months

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
before I could get back out onto the ocean again.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
But what do you do?

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Fall down nine times, get up 10.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
So, the following year, I set out

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
and, fortunately, this time made it safely across to Hawaii.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
But it was not without misadventure.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
My watermaker broke,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
only the most important piece of kit that I have on the boat.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Powered by my solar panels,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
it sucks in saltwater

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
and turns it into freshwater.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
But it doesn't react very well to being immersed in ocean,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
which is what happened to it.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Fortunately, help was at hand.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
There was another unusual boat out there

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
at the same time, doing as I was doing,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
bringing awareness to the North Pacific Garbage Patch,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
that area in the North Pacific about twice the size of Texas,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
with an estimated 3.5 million

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
tons of trash in it,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
circulating at the center of

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
that North Pacific Gyre.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
So, to make the point, these guys

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
had actually built their boat out of plastic trash,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
15,000 empty water bottles

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
latched together into two pontoons.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
They were going very slowly.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Partly, they'd had a bit of a delay.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
They'd had to pull in at Catalina Island shortly after they left Long Beach

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
because the lids of all the water bottles were coming undone,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
and they were starting to sink.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
So they'd had to pull in and do all the lids up.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
But, as I was approaching the end of my water reserves,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
luckily, our courses were converging.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
They were running out of food; I was running out of water.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
So we liaised by satellite phone and arranged to meet up.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
And it took about a week

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
for us to actually gradually converge.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
I was doing a pathetically slow speed

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
of about 1.3 knots,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
and they were doing only marginally less pathetic speed of about 1.4:

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
it was like two snails in a mating dance.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
But, eventually, we did manage to meet up

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
and Joel hopped overboard,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
caught us a beautiful, big mahi-mahi,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
which was the best food I'd had

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
in, ooh, at least three months.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Fortunately, the one that he caught that day

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
was better than this one they caught a few weeks earlier.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
When they opened this one up,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
they found its stomach was full of plastic.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
And this is really bad news because plastic

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
is not an inert substance.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
It leaches out chemicals

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
into the flesh of the poor critter that ate it,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
and then we come along and eat that poor critter,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
and we get some of the toxins accumulating

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
in our bodies as well.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
So there are very real implications for human health.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
I eventually made it to Hawaii still alive.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
And, the following year, set out

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
on the second stage of the Pacific,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
from Hawaii down to Tarawa.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
And you'll notice something about Tarawa;

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
it is very low-lying.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
It's that little green sliver on the horizon,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
which makes them very nervous

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
about rising oceans.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
This is big trouble for these guys.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
They've got no points of land more than about six feet above sea level.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
And also, as an increase in extreme

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
weather events due to climate change,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
they're expecting more waves

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
to come in over the fringing reef,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
which will contaminate their fresh water supply.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
I had a meeting with the president there,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
who told me about his

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
exit strategy for his country.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
He expects that within the next 50 years,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
the 100,000 people that live there

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
will have to relocate to

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
New Zealand or Australia.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
And that made me think about how would I feel

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
if Britain was going to disappear under the waves;

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
if the places where I'd been born

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
and gone to school

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
and got married,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
if all those places were just going to disappear forever.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
How, literally, ungrounded

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
that would make me feel.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Very shortly, I'll be setting out to try and get to Australia,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
and if I'm successful, I'll be the first woman ever to row solo

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
all the way across the Pacific.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
And I try to use this to bring awareness to these environmental issues,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
to bring a human face to the ocean.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
If the Atlantic was about my inner journey,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
discovering my own capabilities,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
maybe the Pacific has been about my outer journey,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
figuring out how I can use

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
my interesting career choice

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
to be of service to the world,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
and to take some of those things that I've learned out there

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
and apply them to the situation

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
that humankind now finds itself in.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
I think there are probably three key points here.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
The first one is about

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
the stories that we tell ourselves.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
For so long, I told myself

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
that I couldn't have an adventure

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
because I wasn't six foot tall

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
and athletic and bearded.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
And then that story changed.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
I found out that people had rowed across oceans.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
I even met one of them and she was just about my size.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
So even though I didn't grow any taller,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
I didn't sprout a beard,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
something had changed: My interior dialogue had changed.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
At the moment, the story that we collectively tell ourselves

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
is that we need all this stuff,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
that we need oil.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
But what about if we just change that story?

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
We do have alternatives,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
and we have the power of free will

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
to choose those alternatives, those sustainable ones,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
to create a greener future.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
The second point is about

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
the accumulation of tiny actions.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
We might think that anything that we do as an individual

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
is just a drop in the ocean, that it can't really make a difference.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
But it does. Generally, we haven't

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
got ourselves into this mess through big disasters.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Yes, there have been the Exxon Valdezes

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
and the Chernobyls,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
but mostly it's been an accumulation

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
of bad decisions

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
by billions of individuals,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
day after day and year after year.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
And, by the same token, we can turn that tide.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
We can start making better,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
wiser, more sustainable decisions.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
And when we do that, we're not just one person.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Anything that we do spreads ripples.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Other people will see if you're in the supermarket line

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
and you pull out your

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
reusable grocery bag.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Maybe if we all start doing this,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
we can make it socially unacceptable

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
to say yes to plastic in the checkout line.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
That's just one example.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
This is a world-wide community.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
The other point:

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
It's about taking responsibility.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
For so much of my life,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
I wanted something else to make me happy.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
I thought if I had the right house or the right car

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
or the right man in my life,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
then I could be happy.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
But when I wrote that obituary exercise,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
I actually grew up a little bit in that moment

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
and realized that I needed to create my own future.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
I couldn't just wait passively

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
for happiness to come and find me.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
And I suppose I'm a selfish environmentalist.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
I plan on being around for a long time,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
and when I'm 90 years old,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
I want to be happy and healthy.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
And it's very difficult to be happy

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
on a planet that's racked

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
with famine and drought.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
It's very difficult to be healthy on a planet

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
where we've poisoned the earth

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
and the sea and the air.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
So, shortly, I'm going to be

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
launching a new initiative

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
called Eco-Heroes.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
And the idea here is that

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
all our Eco-Heroes will log at least one green deed every day.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
It's meant to be a bit of a game.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
We're going to make an iPhone app out of it.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
We just want to try and create that awareness

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
because, sure, changing a light bulb isn't going to change the world,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
but that attitude,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
that awareness that leads you to change the light bulb

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
or take your reusable coffee mug,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
that is what could change the world.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
I really believe that we stand

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
at a very important point in history.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
We have a choice. We've been blessed,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
or cursed, with free will.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
We can choose a greener future,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
and we can get there

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
if we all pull together to take it one stroke at a time.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Thank you.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
(Applause)
