00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Most of the talks

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
that you've heard in the last several fabulous days

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
have been from people who have the characteristic

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
that they have thought about something,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
they are experts, they know what's going on.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
All of you know about the topic

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that I'm supposed to talk about.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
That is, you know what simplicity is,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
you know what complexity is.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The trouble is, I don't.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And what I'm going to do is share with you

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
my ignorance on this subject.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I want you to read this,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
because we're going to come back to it in a moment.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The quote is from

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
the fabled Potter Stewart

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
opinion on pornography.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And let me just read it,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
the important details here:

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
"Shorthand description, ['hardcore pornography'];

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly defining it.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
But I know it when I see it."

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
I'm going to come back to that in a moment.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So, what is simplicity?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
It's good to start with some examples.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
A coffee cup -- we don't think about coffee cups,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
but it's much more interesting than one might think --

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
a coffee cup is a device,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
which has a container and a handle.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
The handle enables you to hold it

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
when the container is filled with hot liquid.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Why is that important?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Well, it enables you to drink coffee.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
But also, by the way, the coffee is hot,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
the liquid is sterile;

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
you're not likely to get cholera that way.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
So the coffee cup, or the cup with a handle,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
is one of the tools used by society

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
to maintain public health.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Scissors are your clothes,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
glasses enable you to see things

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and keep you from being eaten by cheetahs

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
or run down by automobiles,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and books are, after all, your education.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
But there's another class of simple things,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
which are also very important.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Simple in function,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
but not at all simple in how they're constructed.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And the two here are just examples.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
One is the cellphone, which we use every day.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And it rests on a complexity,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
which has some characteristics

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
very different from those that my friend

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Benoit Mandelbrot discussed,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
but are very interesting.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And the other, of course, is a birth control pill,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
which, in a very simple way,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
fundamentally changed the structure of society

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
by changing the role of women in it

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
by providing to them

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
the opportunity to make reproductive choices.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
So, there are two ways of thinking about this word, I think.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And here I've corrupted

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
the Potter Stewart quotation

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
by saying that we can think about something --

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
which spans all the way from scissors

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
to the cell phone,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Internet and birth control pills --

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
by saying that they're simple,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
the functions are simple,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
and we recognize what that simplicity is

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
when we see it.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Or there may be another way of doing it,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
which is to think about the problem in terms of what --

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
if you associate with moral philosophers --

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
is called the teapot problem.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
The teapot problem I'll pose this way.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Suppose you see a teapot,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
and the teapot is

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
filled with hot water.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And you then ask the question:

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Why is the water hot?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And that's a simple question.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
It's like, what is simplicity?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
One answer would be:

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
because the kinetic energy of the water molecules is high

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
and they bounce against things rapidly --

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
that's a kind of physical science argument.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
A second argument would be:

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
because it was sitting on a stove with the flame on --

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
that's an historical argument.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
A third is that I wanted hot water

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
for tea --

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
that's an intentional argument.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
And, since this is coming from a moral philosopher,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
the fourth would be that it's part of God's plan for the universe.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
All of these are possibilities.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
The point is that you get into trouble

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
when you ask a single question

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
with a single box for an answer,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
in which that single question actually is many questions

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
with quite different meanings,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
but with the same words.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Asking, "What is simplicity?" I think falls in that category.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
What is the state of science?

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
And, interestingly, complexity

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
is very highly evolved.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
We have a lot of interesting information

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
about what complexity is.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Simplicity, for reasons

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
that are a little bit obscure,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
is almost not pursued,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
at least in the academic world.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
We academics -- I am an academic --

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
we love complexity.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
You can write papers about complexity,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
and the nice thing about complexity is

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
it's fundamentally intractable in many ways,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
so you're not responsible for outcomes. (Laughter)

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Simplicity -- all of you really would like

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
your Waring Blender in the morning

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
to make whatever a Waring Blender does,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
but not explode or play Beethoven.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
You're not interested in the limits of these things.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
So what one is interested in

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
has a lot to do with the rewards of the system.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
And there's a lot of rewards in thinking

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
about complexity and emergence,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
not so much in thinking about simplicity.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
One of the things I want to do

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
is to help you with a very important task --

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
which you may not know that you have very often --

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
which is to understand

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
how to sit next to a physicist at a dinner party

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
and have a conversation. (Laughter)

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And the words that I would like you to focus on

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
are complexity and emergence,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
because these will enable you to start the conversation

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and then daydream about other things.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
(Laughter)

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
All right, what is complexity in this view of things,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
and what is emergence?

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
We have, actually, a pretty good working definition of complexity.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
It is a system, like traffic,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
which has components.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
The components interact with one another.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
These are cars and drivers. They dissipate energy.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
It turns out that, whenever you have that system,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
weird stuff happens,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
and you in Los Angeles

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
probably know this better than anyone.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Here's another example,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
which I put up because

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
it's an example of really important current science.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
You can't possibly read that. It's not intended that you read it,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
but that's a tiny part

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
of the chemical reactions going on

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
in each of your cells at any given moment.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
And it's like the traffic that you see.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
The amazing thing about the cell is that

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
it actually does maintain a fairly stable

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
working relationship with other cells,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
but we don't know why.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Anyone who tells you that we understand life,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
walk away.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And let me reduce this to the simplest level.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
We've heard from Bill Gates recently.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
All of us, to some extent, study

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
this thing called a Bill Gates.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Terrific. You learn everything you can about that.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
And then there's another kind of thing that you might study,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
and you study that hard.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
That's a Bono, this is a Bono.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
But then, if you know everything you can know about those two things,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
and you put them together,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
what can you say about this combination?

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
The answer is, not a lot.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
And that's complexity.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Now, imagine building that up to a city, or to a society,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
and you've got, obviously, an interesting problem.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
All right, so let me give you an example

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
of simplicity

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
of a particular kind.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
And I want to introduce a word

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
that I think is very useful,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
which is stacking.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
And I'm going to use stacking for a kind of simplicity

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
that has the characteristic

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
that it is so simple

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
and so reliable

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
that I can build things with it.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Or I'm going to use simple to mean

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
reliable, predictable, repeatable.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
And I'm going to use as an example the Internet,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
because it's a particularly good example

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
of stacked simplicity.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
We call it a complex system, which it is,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
but it's also something else.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
The Internet starts with mathematics,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
it starts with binary.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
And if you look at the list of things on the bottom,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
we are familiar with the Arabic numbers

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
one to 10 and so on.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
In binary, one is 0001,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
seven is 0111.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
The question is: Why is binary

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
simpler than Arabic?

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
And the answer is, simply,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
that if I hold up three fingers, you can count that easily,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
but if I hold up this,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
it's sort of hard to say that I just did seven.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
The virtue of binary is that it's the simplest possible way

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
of representing numbers.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Anything else is more complicated.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
You can catch errors with it,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
it's unambiguous in its reading,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
there are lots of good things about binary.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
So it is very, very simple

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
once you learn how to read it.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Now, if you like to represent

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
this zero and one of binary,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
you need a device.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
And think of things in your life

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
that are binary,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
one of them is light switches.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
They can be on and off. That's binary.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Now wall switches, we all know, fail.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
But our friends who are condensed matter physicists

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
managed to come up, some 50 years ago,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
with a very nice device, shown under that bell jar,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
which is a transistor.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
A transistor is nothing more than a wall switch.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
It turns things on and off,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
but it does so without moving parts

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
and it doesn't fail, basically, for a very long period of time.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
So the second layer of simplicity

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
was the transistor in the Internet.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
So, since the transistor is so simple,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
you can put lots of them together.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
And you put lots of them together and you come with

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
something called integrated circuits.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
And a current integrated circuit

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
might have in each one of these chips

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
something like a billion transistors,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
all of which have to work perfectly every time.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
So that's the next layer of simplicity,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
and, in fact, integrated circuits

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
are really simple in the sense that they,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
in general, work really well.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
With integrated circuits, you can build cellphones.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
You all are accustomed to having your cellphones work

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
the large majority of the time.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
In Boston ... Boston is a little bit like Namibia

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
in its cell phone coverage, (Laughter)

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
so that we're not accustomed to that all the time,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
but some of the time.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
But, in fact, if you have cell phones,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
you can now go to this nice lady

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
who's somewhere like Namibia,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
and who is extremely happy with the fact

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
that although she does not have

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
an master's degree in

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
electrical engineering from MIT,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
she's nonetheless able to hack her cell phone

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
to get power in some funny way.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
And from that comes the Internet.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
And this is a map of bitflows across the continent.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
The two blobs that are light in the middle there

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
are the United States and Europe.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
And then back to simplicity again.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
So here we have what I think is one of the great ideas,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
which is Google.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Which, in this simple portal

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
makes the claim

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
that it makes accessible

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
all of the world's information.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
But the point is that

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
that extraordinary simple idea

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
rests on layers of simplicity

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
each compounded into a complexity

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
that is itself simple,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
in the sense that it is completely reliable.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
All right, let me then finish off

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
with four general statements,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
an example and two aphorisms.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
The characteristics, which I think

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
are useful to think about for simple things:

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
First, they are predictable.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Their behavior is predictable.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Now, one of the nice characteristics

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
of simple things

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
is you know what it's going to do, in general.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
So simplicity and predictability

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
are characteristics of simple things.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
The second is, and this is a real world statement,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
they're cheap.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
If you have things that are cheap enough,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
people will find uses for them,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
even if they seem very primitive.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
So, for example, stones.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
You can build cathedrals out of stones,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
you just have to know what it does.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
You carve them in blocks and then you

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
pile them on top of one another,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
and they support weight.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
So there has to be function, the function has to be predictable

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
and the cost has to be low.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
What that means is

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
that you have to have a high performance

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
or value for cost.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
And then I would propose

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
as this last component

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
that they serve, or have the potential to serve,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
as building blocks.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
That is, you can stack them.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
And stack can mean this way, or it can mean this way,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
or it can mean in some arbitrary n-dimensional space.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
But if you have something that has a function,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
and it's really cheap,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
people will find new ways of putting it together

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
to make new things.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Cheap, functional, reliable things

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
unleash the creativity of people

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
who then build stuff that you could not imagine.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
There's no way of predicting the Internet

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
based on the first transistor.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
It just is not possible.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
So these are the components.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Now, the example

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
is something that I want to give you

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
from the work that we ourselves do.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
We are very interested in

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
delivering health care in the developing world,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
and one of the things that we wish to do in this particular business

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
is to find a way of doing medical diagnosis

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
at as close to zero cost

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
as we can manage.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
So, how does one do that?

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
This is a world in which there's no electricity,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
there's no money, there's no medical competence.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
And I don't want to spend your time in going through the details,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
but in the lower right-hand corner,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
you see an example of the kind of thing that we have.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
It's a little paper chip.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
It has a few things printed on it

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
using the same technology

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
that you use for making comic books,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
which was the inspiration for this particular idea.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
And you put a drop, in this case, of urine at the bottom.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
It wicks its way up into these little branches.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
You know, no power required.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
It turns colors. In this particular case,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
you're reading kidney function.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
And, since the health care worker

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
of much of this part of the world

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
is an 18 year-old with an AK-47,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
who happens to be out of work and is willing

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
to go around and do this sort of thing,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
he can take a picture of it with his cellphone,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
send the picture back to where there is a doctor,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
and the doctor can look at it.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
So what you've done is to take a technology,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
which is available everywhere,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
make a device, which is extremely cheap,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
and make it in such a fashion

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
that it is very, very reliable.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
If we can pull this off,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
if we can build more function,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
it will be stackable.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
That is to say, if we can make the basic technology

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
of one or two things work,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
it will be applicable to a very, very

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
large variety of human conditions,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
and hence, extendable in both

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
vertical and horizontal directions.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Part of my interest in this, I have to say,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
is that I would like to -- how do I put this politely? --

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
change the way, or maybe eviscerate,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
the capital structure of the U.S. health care system,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
which I think is fundamentally broken.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
So, let me close --

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
(Applause)

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Let me close with my two aphorisms.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
One of them is from Mr. Einstein,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
and he says, "Everything should be made

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
as simple as possible, but not simpler."

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
And I think that's a very good way of thinking about the problem.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
If you take too much out

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
of something that's simple, you lose function.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
You have to have low cost,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
but you also have to have a function.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
So you can't make it too simple.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
And the second is a design issue,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
and it's not directly relevant, but it's a nice statement.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
This is by de Saint-Exupery.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
And he says, "You know you've achieved perfection in design,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
not when you have nothing more to add,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
but when you have nothing more to take away."

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
And that certainly is going in the right direction.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
So, what I think one can begin to do

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
with this kind of

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
cut at the word simplicity,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
which doesn't cover Brancusi,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
it doesn't answer the question of

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
why Mondrian is better or worse

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
or simpler or less simpler than Van Gogh,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
and certainly doesn't address the question

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
of whether Mozart is simpler than Bach.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
But it does make a point --

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
which is one which, in a sense,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
differentiates the real world of people who make things,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
and the world of people who think about things,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
which is, there is an intellectual merit

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
to asking: How do we make things

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
as simple as we can,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
as cheap as we can, as functional as we can

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
and as freely interconnectable as we can?

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
If we make that kind of simplicity in our technology

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
and then give it to you guys,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
you can go off and do all kinds of fabulous things with it.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Thank you very much.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:05.000
(Applause)

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Chris Anderson: Quick question.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
So can you picture

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
that a science of simplicity

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
might get to the point where

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
you could look out at various systems --

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
say a financial system or a legal system, health system -- and say,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
"That has got to the point of danger

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
or dysfunctionality for the following reasons,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
and this is how we might simplify it"?

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
George Whitesides: Yes, I think you could. Because if you look

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
at the components from which the system is made

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
and examine their fragility, or their stability,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
you can probably build a kind of risk assessment based on that basis.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
CA: Have you started to do that?

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
I mean, with the health system, you got a sort of

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
radical solution on the cost side,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
but in terms of the system itself?

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
GW: Well, no.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
How do I put that simply? No.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
CA: That was a simple, powerful answer. GW: Yes.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
CA: So, in terms of

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
that diagnostic technology that you've got,

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
where is that, and when do you see that

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
maybe getting rolled out to scale.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
GW: That's coming out soon. I mean, the systems work,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
and we have to find out how to manufacture them and do things of this kind,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
but the basic technology works.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
CA: You've got a company set up to ...

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
GW: A foundation, a foundation. Not-for-profit.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
CA: All right. Well, thank you so much for your talk. Thank you. (Applause)
