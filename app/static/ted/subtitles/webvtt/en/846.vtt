00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
If you go on the TED website,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
you can currently find there

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
over a full week of TEDTalk videos,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
over 1.3 million

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
words of transcripts

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and millions of user ratings.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And that's a huge amount of data.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And it got me wondering:

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
If you took all this data

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and put it through statistical analysis,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
could you reverse engineer a TEDTalk?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Could you create

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
the ultimate TEDTalk?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And also, could you create

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
the worst possible TEDTalk

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
that they would still let you get away with?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
To find this out, I looked at three things:

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I looked at the topic that you should choose,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I looked at how you should deliver it

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and the visuals onstage.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Now, with the topic: There's a whole range of topics you can choose,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
but you should choose wisely,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
because your topic strongly correlates

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
with how users will react to your talk.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Now, to make this more concrete,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
let's look at the list of top 10 words

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
that statistically stick out

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
in the most favorite TEDTalks

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and in the least favorite TEDTalks.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
So if you came here

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
to talk about how French coffee

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
will spread happiness in our brains,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
that's a go.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Whereas, if you wanted to talk about

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
your project involving

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
oxygen, girls, aircraft --

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
actually, I would like to hear that talk, (Laughter)

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
but statistics say it's not so good.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Oh, well.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
If you generalize this,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
the most favorite TEDTalks are those

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
that feature topics we can connect with,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
both easily and deeply,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
such as happiness, our own body,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
food, emotions.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And the more technical topics,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
such as architecture, materials and, strangely enough, men,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
those are not good topics to talk about.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
How should you deliver your talk?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
TED is famous for keeping

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
a very sharp eye on the clock,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
so they're going to hate me

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
for revealing this, because, actually,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
you should talk as long as they will let you. (Laughter)

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Because the most favorite TEDTalks

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
are, on average, over 50 percent longer

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
than the least favorite ones.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And this holds true for all ranking lists on TED.com

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
except if you want to have a talk

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
that's beautiful, inspiring or funny.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Then, you should be brief. (Laughter) But other than that,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
talk until they drag you off the stage.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
(Laughter)

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Now, while ...

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
(Applause)

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
While you're pushing the clock, there's a few rules to obey.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I found these rules out by comparing the statistics

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
of four-word phrases

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
that appear more often in the most favorite TEDTalks

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
as opposed to the least favorite TEDTalks.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I'll give you three examples.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
First of all, I must, as a speaker,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
provide a service to the audience and talk about what I will give you,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
instead of saying what I can't have.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Secondly, it's imperative

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
that you do not cite The New York Times.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
(Laughter)

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And finally, it's okay for the speaker -- that's the good news --

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
to fake intellectual capacity.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
If I don't understand something, I can just say, "etc., etc."

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
You'll all stay with me.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
It's perfectly fine.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
(Applause)

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Now, let's go to the visuals.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
The most obvious visual thing on stage is the speaker.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
And analysis shows if you want to be

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
among the most favorite TED speakers,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
you should let your hair grow a little bit longer than average,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
make sure you wear your glasses and be slightly more dressed-up

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
than the average TED speaker.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Slides are okay, though you might consider going for props.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And now the most important thing,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
that is the mood onstage.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Color plays a very important role.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Color closely correlates

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
with the ratings that talks get on the website.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
(Applause)

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
For example, fascinating talks

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
contain a statistically high amount

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
of exactly this blue color, (Laughter)

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
much more than the average TEDTalk.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Ingenious TEDTalks, much more this green color,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
etc., et.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.000
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Now, personally, I think

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
I'm not the first one who has done this analysis,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
but I'll leave this

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
to your good judgment.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
So, now it's time to put it all together

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
and design the ultimate TEDTalk.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Now, since this is TEDActive,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
and I learned from my analysis

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
that I should actually give you something,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
I will not impose the ultimate

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
or worst TEDTalk on you,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
but rather give you a tool to create your own.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
And I call this tool the TEDPad.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
(Laughter)

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
And the TEDPad is a matrix

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
of 100 specifically selected,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
highly curated sentences

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
that you can easily piece together to get your own TEDTalk.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
You only have to make one decision,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
and that is: Are you going to use the white version

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
for very good TEDTalks,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
about creativity, human genius?

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Or are you going to go with a black version,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
which will allow you to create really bad TEDTalks,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
mostly about blogs,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
politics and stuff?

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
So, download it and have fun with it.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Now I hope you enjoy the session.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
I hope you enjoy designing your own

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
ultimate and worst possible TEDTalks.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
And I hope some of you will be inspired for next year

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
to create this, which I really want to see.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Thank you very much.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:35.000
(Applause) Thanks.
