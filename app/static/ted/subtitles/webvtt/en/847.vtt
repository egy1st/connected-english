00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So here it is. You can check: I am short, I'm French,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I have a pretty strong French accent,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
so that's going to be clear in a moment.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Maybe a sobering thought

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and something you all know about.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And I suspect many of you gave

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
something to the people of Haiti this year.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And there is something else

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I believe in the back of your mind

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
you also know.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
That is, every day,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
25,000 children die

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
of entirely preventable causes.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
That's a Haiti earthquake every eight days.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And I suspect many of you probably gave something

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
towards that problem as well,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
but somehow it doesn't happen

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
with the same intensity.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So why is that?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Well, here is a thought experiment for you.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Imagine you have a few million dollars that you've raised --

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
maybe you're a politician in a developing country

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and you have a budget to spend. You want to spend it on the poor:

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
How do you go about it?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Do you believe the people who tell you

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
that all we need to do is to spend money?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
That we know how to eradicate poverty,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
we just need to do more?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Or do you believe the people who tell you that

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
aid is not going to help, on the contrary it might hurt,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
it might exacerbate corruption, dependence, etc.?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Or maybe you turn to the past.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
After all, we have spent billions of dollars on aid.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Maybe you look at the past and see.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Has it done any good?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And, sadly, we don't know.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And worst of all, we will never know.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And the reason is that -- take Africa for example.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Africans have already got a lot of aid.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
These are the blue bars.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And the GDP in Africa is not making much progress.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Okay, fine. How do you know what

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
would have happened without the aid?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Maybe it would have been much worse,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
or maybe it would have been better.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
We have no idea. We don't know what the counterfactual is.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
There's only one Africa.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
So what do you do?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
To give the aid, and hope and pray that something comes out of it?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Or do you focus on your everyday life

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and let the earthquake every eight days

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
continue to happen?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
The thing is, if we don't know

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
whether we are doing any good,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
we are not any better

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
than the Medieval doctors and their leeches.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Sometimes the patient gets better, sometimes the patient dies.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Is it the leeches? Is it something else?

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
We don't know.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
So here are some other questions.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
They're smaller questions,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
but they are not that small.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Immunization, that's the cheapest way

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
to save a child's life.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And the world has spent a lot of money on it:

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
The GAVI and the Gates Foundations

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
are each pledging a lot of money towards it,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
and developing countries themselves have been doing a lot of effort.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And yet, every year

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
at least 25 million children

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
do not get the immunization they should get.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
So this is what you call a "last mile problem."

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
The technology is there,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
the infrastructure is there,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and yet it doesn't happen.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
So you have your million.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
How do you use your million

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
to solve this last mile problem?

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And here's another question:

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Malaria. Malaria kills almost

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
900,000 people every year,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
most of them in Sub-Saharan Africa,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
most of them under five.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
In fact, that is the leading cause of under-five mortality.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
We already know how to kill malaria,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
but some people come to you and say,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
"You have your millions. How about bed nets?"

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Bed nets are very cheap.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
For 10 dollars, you can manufacture and ship

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
an insecticide treated bed net

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
and you can teach someone to use them.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And, not only do they protect the people who sleep under them,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
but they have these great contagion benefits.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
If half of a community sleeps under a net,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
the other half also benefits

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
because the contagion of the disease spread.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And yet, only a quarter of kids at risk sleep under a net.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Societies should be willing to go out

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
and subsidize the net, give them for free,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
or, for that matter, pay people to use them

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
because of those contagion benefits.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
"Not so fast," say other people.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
"If you give the nets for free,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
people are not going to value them.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
They're not going to use them,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
or at least they're not going to use them as bed nets,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
maybe as fishing nets."

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
So, what do you do?

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Do you give the nets for free to maximize coverage,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
or do you make people pay

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
in order to make sure that they really value them?

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
How do you know?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
And a third question: Education.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Maybe that's the solution, maybe we should send kids to school.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
But how do you do that?

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Do you hire teachers? Do you build more schools?

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Do you provide school lunch?

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
How do you know?

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
So here is the thing.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
I cannot answer the big question,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
whether aid did any good or not.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
But these three questions, I can answer them.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
It's not the Middle Ages anymore,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
it's the 21st century.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And in the 20th century,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
randomized, controlled trials

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
have revolutionized medicine

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
by allowing us to distinguish

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
between drugs that work

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
and drugs that don't work.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
And you can do the same

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
randomized, controlled trial for social policy.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
You can put social innovation to the same

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
rigorous, scientific tests

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
that we use for drugs.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
And in this way, you can take the guesswork

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
out of policy-making

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
by knowing what works,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
what doesn't work and why.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
And I'll give you some examples with those three questions.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
So I start with immunization.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Here's Udaipur District, Rajasthan. Beautiful.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Well, when I started working there,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
about one percent of children

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
were fully immunized.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
That's bad, but there are places like that.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Now, it's not because the vaccines are not there --

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
they are there and they are free --

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and it's not because parents do not care about their kids.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
The same child that is not immunized against measles,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
if they do get measles, parents will spend

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
thousands of rupees to help them.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
So you get these empty village subcenters

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
and crowded hospitals.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
So what is the problem?

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Well, part of the problem, surely, is people do not fully understand.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
After all, in this country as well,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
all sorts of myths and misconceptions

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
go around immunization.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
So if that's the case, that's difficult,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
because persuasion is really difficult.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
But maybe there is another problem as well.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
It's going from intention to action.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Imagine you are a mother

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
in Udaipur District, Rajasthan.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
You have to walk a few kilometers to get your kids immunized.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
And maybe when you get there, what you find is this:

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
The subcenter is closed. Ao you have to come back,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
and you are so busy and you have so many other things to do,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
you will always tend to postpone and postpone,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and eventually it gets too late.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Well, if that's the problem, then that's much easier.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Because A, we can make it easy,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
and B, we can maybe

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
give people a reason to act today,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
rather than wait till tomorrow.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
So these are simple ideas, but we didn't know.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
So let's try them.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
So what we did is we did a randomized, controlled trial

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
in 134 villages in Udaipur Districts.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
So the blue dots

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
are selected randomly.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
We made it easy -- I'll tell you how in a moment.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
In the red dots, we made it easy

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
and gave people a reason to act now.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
The white dots are comparisons, nothing changed.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
So we make it easy by organizing

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
this monthly camp where people can

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
get their kids immunized.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
And then you make it easy

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
and give a reason to act now

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
by adding a kilo of lentils for each immunization.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Now, a kilo of lentils is tiny.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
It's never going to convince anybody

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
to do something that they don't want to do.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
On the other hand, if your problem is you tend to postpone,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
then it might give you a reason to act today

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
rather than later.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
So what do we find?

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Well, beforehand, everything is the same.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
That's the beauty of randomization.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Afterwards,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
the camp -- just having the camp --

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
increases immunization from six percent to 17 percent.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
That's full immunization.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
That's not bad, that's a good improvement.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Add the lentils and you reach to 38 percent.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
So here you've got your answer.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Make it easy and give a kilo of lentils,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
you multiply immunization rate by six.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Now, you might say, "Well, but it's not sustainable.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
We cannot keep giving lentils to people."

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Well, it turns out it's wrong economics,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
because it is cheaper

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
to give lentils than not to give them.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Since you have to pay for the nurse anyway,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
the cost per immunization

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
ends up being cheaper if you give incentives than if you don't.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
How about bed nets?

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Should you give them for free, or should you ask people to pay for them?

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
So the answer hinges

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
on the answer to three simple questions.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
One is: If people must pay for a bed net,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
are they going to purchase them?

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
The second one is:

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
If I give bed nets for free,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
are people going to use them?

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
And the third one is:

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Do free bed nets discourage future purchase?

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
The third one is important

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
because if we think people get used to handouts,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
it might destroy markets to distribute free bed nets.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Now this is a debate that has generated

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
a lot of emotion and angry rhetoric.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
It's more ideological than practical,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
but it turns out it's an easy question.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
We can know the answer to this question.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
We can just run an experiment.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
And many experiments have been run, and they all have the same results,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
so I'm just going to talk to you about one.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
And this one that was in Kenya,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
they went around and distributed to people

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
vouchers, discount vouchers.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
So people with their voucher

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
could get the bed net in the local pharmacy.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
And some people get 100 percent discount,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
and some people get 20 percent discounts,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
and some people get 50 percent discount, etc.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
And now we can see what happens.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
So, how about the purchasing?

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Well, what you can see is that

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
when people have to pay for their bed nets,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
the coverage rate really falls down a lot.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
So even with partial subsidy,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
three dollars is still not the full cost of a bed net,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
and now you only have 20 percent of the people with the bed nets,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
you lose the health immunity, that's not great.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Second thing is, how about the use?

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Well, the good news is, people, if they have the bed nets,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
will use the bed nets regardless of how they got it.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
If they get it for free, they use it.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
If they have to pay for it, they use it.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
How about the long term?

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
In the long term,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
people who got the free bed nets,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
one year later, were offered the option

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
to purchase a bed net at two dollars.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
And people who got the free one

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
were actually more likely to purchase the second one

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
than people who didn't get a free one.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
So people do not get used to handouts; they get used to nets.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Maybe we need to give them a little bit more credit.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
So, that's for bed nets. So you will think, "That's great.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
You know how to immunize kids, you know how to give bed nets."

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
But what politicians need is a range of options.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
They need to know: Out of all the things I could do,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
what is the best way to achieve my goals?

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
So suppose your goal is to get kids into school.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
There are so many things you could do. You could pay for uniforms,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
you could eliminate fees, you could build latrines,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
you could give girls sanitary pads, etc., etc.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
So what's the best?

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Well, at some level, we think

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
all of these things should work.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
So, is that sufficient? If we think they should work intuitively,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
should we go for them?

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Well, in business, that's certainly not the way we would go about it.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Consider for example

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
transporting goods.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Before the canals were invented

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
in Britain before the Industrial Revolution,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
goods used to go on horse carts.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And then canals were built,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
and with the same horseman and the same horse,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
you could carry ten times as much cargo.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
So should they have continued

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
to carry the goods on the horse carts, on the ground,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
that they would eventually get there?

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Well, if that had been the case,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
there would have been no Industrial Revolution.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
So why shouldn't we do the same with social policy?

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
In technology, we spend so much time

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
experimenting, fine-tuning,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
getting the absolute cheapest way to do something,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
so why aren't we doing that with social policy?

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Well, with experiments, what you can do

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
is answer a simple question.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Suppose you have 100 dollars to spend

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
on various interventions.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
How many extra years of education

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
do you get for your hundred dollars?

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Now I'm going to show you

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
what we get with various education interventions.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
So the first ones are if you want the usual suspects,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
hire teachers, school meals,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
school uniforms, scholarships.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
And that's not bad. For your hundred dollars,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
you get between one and three extra years of education.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Things that don't work so well is bribing parents,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
just because so many kids are already going to school

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
that you end up spending a lot of money.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
And here are the most surprising results.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Tell people the benefits of education,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
that's very cheap to do.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
So for every hundred dollars you spend doing that,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
you get 40 extra years of education.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
And, in places where there are worms,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
intestinal worms,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
cure the kids of their worms.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
And for every hundred dollars,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
you get almost 30 extra years of education.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
So this is not your intuition,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
this is not what people would have gone for,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
and yet, these are the programs that work.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
We need that kind of information, we need more of it,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
and then we need to guide policy.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
So now, I started from the big problem, and I couldn't answer it.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
And I cut it into smaller questions,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
and I have the answer to these smaller questions.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
And they are good, scientific, robust answers.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
So let's go back to Haiti for a moment.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
In Haiti, about 200,000 people died --

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
actually, a bit more by the latest estimate.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
And the response of the world was great:

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Two billion dollars got pledged just last month,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
so that's about 10,000 dollars per death.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
That doesn't sound like that much when you think about it.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
But if we were willing to spend 10,000 dollars

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
for every child under five who dies,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
that would be 90 billion per year

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
just for that problem.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
And yet it doesn't happen.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
So, why is that?

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Well, I think what part of the problem is that,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
in Haiti, although the problem is huge,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
somehow we understand it, it's localized.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
You give your money to Doctors Without Borders,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
you give your money to Partners In Health,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
and they'll send in the doctors, and they'll send in the lumber,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
and they'll helicopter things out and in.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
And the problem of poverty is not like that.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
So, first, it's mostly invisible;

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
second, it's huge;

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
and third, we don't know whether we are doing the right thing.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
There's no silver bullet.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
You cannot helicopter people out of poverty.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
And that's very frustrating.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
But look what we just did today.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
I gave you three simple answers to three questions:

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Give lentils to immunize people,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
provide free bed nets, deworm children.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
With immunization or bed nets,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
you can save a life for 300 dollars per life saved.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
With deworming, you can get

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
an extra year of education for three dollars.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
So we cannot eradicate poverty just yet,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
but we can get started.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
And maybe we can get started small

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
with things that we know are effective.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
Here's an example of how this can be powerful.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Deworming.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Worms have a little bit of a problem grabbing the headlines.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
They are not beautiful and don't kill anybody.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
And yet, when the young global leader in Davos

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
showed the numbers I gave you,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
they started Deworm the World.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
And thanks to Deworm the World,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
and the effort of many country governments and foundations,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
20 million school-aged children got dewormed in 2009.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
So this evidence is powerful.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
It can prompt action.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
So we should get started now.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
It's not going to be easy.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
It's a very slow process.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
You have to keep experimenting, and sometimes ideology

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
has to be trumped by practicality.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
And sometimes what works somewhere doesn't work elsewhere.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
So it's a slow process,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
but there is no other way.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
These economics I'm proposing,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
it's like 20th century medicine.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
It's a slow, deliberative process

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
of discovery.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
There is no miracle cure,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
but modern medicine is saving

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
millions of lives every year,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
and we can do the same thing.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
And now, maybe, we can go back to the bigger question

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
that I started with at the beginning.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
I cannot tell you

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
whether the aid we have spent in the past has made a difference,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
but can we come back here in 30 years

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
and say, "What we have done,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
it really prompted a change for the better."

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
I believe we can and I hope we will.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Thank you.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
(Applause)
