00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.976
How do you explain
when things don't go as we assume?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.976
Or better, how do you explain

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.976
when others are able to achieve things
that seem to defy all of the assumptions?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.976
For example:

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.976
Why is Apple so innovative?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.976
Year after year, after year,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.976
they're more innovative
than all their competition.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.976
And yet, they're just a computer company.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.976
They're just like everyone else.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.190
They have the same access
to the same talent,

00:00:27.214 --> 00:00:28.215
the same agencies,

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:30.095
the same consultants, the same media.

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.579
Then why is it that they seem
to have something different?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.976
Why is it that Martin Luther King
led the Civil Rights Movement?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.976
He wasn't the only man
who suffered in pre-civil rights America,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.745
and he certainly wasn't
the only great orator of the day.

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:46.976
Why him?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.976
And why is it that the Wright brothers

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.976
were able to figure out controlled,
powered man flight

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.150
when there were certainly other teams

00:00:55.174 --> 00:00:58.047
who were better qualified,
better funded --

00:00:58.071 --> 00:01:00.976
and they didn't achieve
powered man flight,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.975
and the Wright brothers beat them to it.

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:04.887
There's something else at play here.

00:01:06.125 --> 00:01:09.976
About three and a half years ago,
I made a discovery.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.976
And this discovery profoundly changed
my view on how I thought the world worked,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and it even profoundly changed the way
in which I operate in it.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.976
As it turns out, there's a pattern.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.976
As it turns out, all the great inspiring
leaders and organizations in the world,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.015
whether it's Apple or Martin Luther King
or the Wright brothers,

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:35.976
they all think, act and communicate
the exact same way.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.976
And it's the complete opposite
to everyone else.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.976
All I did was codify it,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.976
and it's probably
the world's simplest idea.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I call it the golden circle.

00:01:56.296 --> 00:01:58.976
Why? How? What?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.976
This little idea explains

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.976
why some organizations and some leaders
are able to inspire where others aren't.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.976
Let me define the terms really quickly.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.976
Every single person, every single
organization on the planet

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.722
knows what they do, 100 percent.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.976
Some know how they do it,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.684
whether you call it
your differentiated value proposition

00:02:18.708 --> 00:02:20.976
or your proprietary process or your USP.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.747
But very, very few people or organizations
know why they do what they do.

00:02:25.771 --> 00:02:27.976
And by "why" I don't mean
"to make a profit."

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.976
That's a result. It's always a result.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.976
By "why," I mean: What's your purpose?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.439
What's your cause? What's your belief?

00:02:34.463 --> 00:02:37.976
Why does your organization exist?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.368
Why do you get out of bed in the morning?

00:02:40.392 --> 00:02:42.976
And why should anyone care?

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.905
As a result, the way we think, we act,

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:47.745
the way we communicate
is from the outside in, it's obvious.

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.460
We go from the clearest thing
to the fuzziest thing.

00:02:50.484 --> 00:02:53.976
But the inspired leaders
and the inspired organizations --

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.595
regardless of their size,
regardless of their industry --

00:02:57.619 --> 00:03:00.745
all think, act and communicate
from the inside out.

00:03:02.547 --> 00:03:03.976
Let me give you an example.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.388
I use Apple because they're easy
to understand and everybody gets it.

00:03:07.412 --> 00:03:09.983
If Apple were like everyone else,

00:03:10.007 --> 00:03:13.487
a marketing message from them
might sound like this:

00:03:13.511 --> 00:03:14.996
"We make great computers.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.976
They're beautifully designed,
simple to use and user friendly.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.289
Want to buy one?"

00:03:22.194 --> 00:03:23.195
"Meh."

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:24.976
That's how most of us communicate.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.488
That's how most marketing
and sales are done,

00:03:27.512 --> 00:03:29.607
that's how we communicate interpersonally.

00:03:29.631 --> 00:03:31.402
We say what we do,

00:03:31.426 --> 00:03:33.195
we say how we're different or better

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:35.076
and we expect some sort of a behavior,

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.076
a purchase, a vote, something like that.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.376
Here's our new law firm:

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.822
We have the best lawyers
with the biggest clients,

00:03:40.846 --> 00:03:42.468
we always perform for our clients.

00:03:42.492 --> 00:03:43.976
Here's our new car:

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.632
It gets great gas mileage,
it has leather seats.

00:03:46.656 --> 00:03:47.845
Buy our car.

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:48.976
But it's uninspiring.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.647
Here's how Apple actually communicates.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.976
"Everything we do,
we believe in challenging the status quo.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.976
We believe in thinking differently.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.431
The way we challenge the status quo

00:04:03.455 --> 00:04:05.976
is by making our products
beautifully designed,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.976
simple to use and user friendly.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.639
We just happen to make great computers.

00:04:10.663 --> 00:04:11.717
Want to buy one?"

00:04:12.892 --> 00:04:14.195
Totally different, right?

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:16.176
You're ready to buy a computer from me.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.398
I just reversed
the order of the information.

00:04:18.422 --> 00:04:22.294
What it proves to us is
that people don't buy what you do;

00:04:22.318 --> 00:04:24.723
people buy why you do it.

00:04:24.747 --> 00:04:28.976
This explains why
every single person in this room

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.976
is perfectly comfortable buying
a computer from Apple.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.976
But we're also perfectly comfortable

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.976
buying an MP3 player from Apple,
or a phone from Apple,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.977
or a DVR from Apple.

00:04:39.001 --> 00:04:41.528
As I said before,
Apple's just a computer company.

00:04:41.552 --> 00:04:44.976
Nothing distinguishes them structurally
from any of their competitors.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.448
Their competitors are equally qualified
to make all of these products.

00:04:48.472 --> 00:04:49.976
In fact, they tried.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.976
A few years ago, Gateway
came out with flat-screen TVs.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.429
They're eminently qualified
to make flat-screen TVs.

00:04:55.453 --> 00:04:57.976
They've been making
flat-screen monitors for years.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.573
Nobody bought one.

00:05:02.657 --> 00:05:07.976
Dell came out with MP3 players and PDAs,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.976
and they make great quality products,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.976
and they can make perfectly
well-designed products --

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.800
and nobody bought one.

00:05:14.824 --> 00:05:17.276
In fact, talking about it now,
we can't even imagine

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.848
buying an MP3 player from Dell.

00:05:18.872 --> 00:05:21.076
Why would you buy one
from a computer company?

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.697
But we do it every day.

00:05:22.721 --> 00:05:25.212
People don't buy what you do;
they buy why you do it.

00:05:25.236 --> 00:05:30.761
The goal is not to do business
with everybody who needs what you have.

00:05:30.785 --> 00:05:34.848
The goal is to do business with people
who believe what you believe.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.627
Here's the best part:

00:05:37.651 --> 00:05:39.976
None of what I'm telling you
is my opinion.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.976
It's all grounded
in the tenets of biology.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.976
Not psychology, biology.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.739
If you look at a cross-section
of the human brain,

00:05:47.763 --> 00:05:50.396
from the top down,
the human brain is actually broken

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:51.976
into three major components

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.976
that correlate perfectly
with the golden circle.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.976
Our newest brain, our Homo sapien brain,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.976
our neocortex,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.976
corresponds with the "what" level.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.976
The neocortex is responsible

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.976
for all of our rational
and analytical thought and language.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.976
The middle two sections make up
our limbic brains,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.976
and our limbic brains are responsible
for all of our feelings,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.976
like trust and loyalty.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.143
It's also responsible
for all human behavior,

00:06:19.167 --> 00:06:20.976
all decision-making,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.976
and it has no capacity for language.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.976
In other words, when we communicate
from the outside in,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.143
yes, people can understand vast
amounts of complicated information

00:06:30.167 --> 00:06:32.976
like features and benefits
and facts and figures.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.976
It just doesn't drive behavior.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.096
When we can communicate
from the inside out,

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.359
we're talking directly
to the part of the brain

00:06:39.383 --> 00:06:40.976
that controls behavior,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.976
and then we allow people to rationalize it
with the tangible things we say and do.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.550
This is where gut decisions come from.

00:06:47.574 --> 00:06:50.976
Sometimes you can give somebody
all the facts and figures,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.722
and they say, "I know
what all the facts and details say,

00:06:53.746 --> 00:06:55.276
but it just doesn't feel right."

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.840
Why would we use that verb,
it doesn't "feel" right?

00:06:57.864 --> 00:07:00.639
Because the part of the brain
that controls decision-making

00:07:00.663 --> 00:07:01.976
doesn't control language.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.461
The best we can muster up is,

00:07:03.485 --> 00:07:05.538
"I don't know. 
It just doesn't feel right."

00:07:05.562 --> 00:07:08.976
Or sometimes you say you're leading
with your heart or soul.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.672
I hate to break it to you,
those aren't other body parts

00:07:11.696 --> 00:07:12.976
controlling your behavior.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.143
It's all happening here
in your limbic brain,

00:07:15.167 --> 00:07:18.453
the part of the brain that controls
decision-making and not language.

00:07:18.477 --> 00:07:20.976
But if you don't know
why you do what you do,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.976
and people respond
to why you do what you do,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.976
then how will you ever get people

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.048
to vote for you,
or buy something from you,

00:07:29.072 --> 00:07:30.976
or, more importantly, be loyal

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.976
and want to be a part
of what it is that you do.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.050
The goal is not just to sell
to people who need what you have;

00:07:37.074 --> 00:07:39.976
the goal is to sell to people
who believe what you believe.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.976
The goal is not just
to hire people who need a job;

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.976
it's to hire people
who believe what you believe.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.120
I always say that, you know,

00:07:49.144 --> 00:07:54.976
if you hire people just because they can
do a job, they'll work for your money,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.791
but if they believe what you believe,

00:07:56.815 --> 00:07:59.250
they'll work for you with blood
and sweat and tears.

00:07:59.274 --> 00:08:02.976
Nowhere else is there a better example
than with the Wright brothers.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.614
Most people don't know
about Samuel Pierpont Langley.

00:08:06.638 --> 00:08:08.976
And back in the early 20th century,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.143
the pursuit of powered man flight
was like the dot com of the day.

00:08:12.167 --> 00:08:13.976
Everybody was trying it.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.976
And Samuel Pierpont Langley
had, what we assume,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.673
to be the recipe for success.

00:08:19.697 --> 00:08:21.396
Even now, you ask people,

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:24.039
"Why did your product
or why did your company fail?"

00:08:24.063 --> 00:08:26.324
and people always give
you the same permutation

00:08:26.348 --> 00:08:27.769
of the same three things:

00:08:27.793 --> 00:08:30.770
under-capitalized, the wrong people,
bad market conditions.

00:08:30.794 --> 00:08:33.605
It's always the same three things,
so let's explore that.

00:08:34.422 --> 00:08:35.976
Samuel Pierpont Langley

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.976
was given 50,000 dollars
by the War Department

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.976
to figure out this flying machine.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.571
Money was no problem.

00:08:42.595 --> 00:08:44.976
He held a seat at Harvard

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
and worked at the Smithsonian
and was extremely well-connected;

00:08:48.024 --> 00:08:49.976
he knew all the big minds of the day.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.976
He hired the best minds money could find

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.976
and the market conditions were fantastic.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.976
The New York Times
followed him around everywhere,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.976
and everyone was rooting for Langley.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.988
Then how come we've never heard
of Samuel Pierpont Langley?

00:09:04.485 --> 00:09:06.626
A few hundred miles away in Dayton, Ohio,

00:09:07.579 --> 00:09:08.976
Orville and Wilbur Wright,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.976
they had none of what we consider
to be the recipe for success.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.976
They had no money;

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.239
they paid for their dream
with the proceeds from their bicycle shop.

00:09:18.263 --> 00:09:20.549
Not a single person
on the Wright brothers' team

00:09:20.573 --> 00:09:21.976
had a college education,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.976
not even Orville or Wilbur.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.976
And The New York Times
followed them around nowhere.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.976
The difference was,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.976
Orville and Wilbur were driven by a cause,
by a purpose, by a belief.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.976
They believed that if they could
figure out this flying machine,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.797
it'll change the course of the world.

00:09:40.384 --> 00:09:42.333
Samuel Pierpont Langley was different.

00:09:42.357 --> 00:09:44.976
He wanted to be rich,
and he wanted to be famous.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.976
He was in pursuit of the result.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.976
He was in pursuit of the riches.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.954
And lo and behold, look what happened.

00:09:50.978 --> 00:09:54.524
The people who believed
in the Wright brothers' dream

00:09:54.548 --> 00:09:56.976
worked with them with blood
and sweat and tears.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.976
The others just worked for the paycheck.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.195
They tell stories of how every time
the Wright brothers went out,

00:10:02.219 --> 00:10:04.226
they would have to take
five sets of parts,

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:07.264
because that's how many times
they would crash before supper.

00:10:08.666 --> 00:10:12.683
And, eventually, on December 17th, 1903,

00:10:12.707 --> 00:10:14.976
the Wright brothers took flight,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.048
and no one was there
to even experience it.

00:10:17.072 --> 00:10:19.151
We found out about it a few days later.

00:10:20.754 --> 00:10:24.777
And further proof that Langley
was motivated by the wrong thing:

00:10:24.801 --> 00:10:27.135
the day the Wright brothers took flight,

00:10:27.159 --> 00:10:28.160
he quit.

00:10:28.184 --> 00:10:29.976
He could have said,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.976
"That's an amazing discovery, guys,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.976
and I will improve
upon your technology," but he didn't.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.591
He wasn't first, he didn't get rich,
he didn't get famous, so he quit.

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:42.210
People don't buy what you do;
they buy why you do it.

00:10:42.234 --> 00:10:43.976
If you talk about what you believe,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.976
you will attract those
who believe what you believe.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.334
But why is it important to attract
those who believe what you believe?

00:10:52.404 --> 00:10:54.957
Something called the law
of diffusion of innovation,

00:10:54.981 --> 00:10:57.491
if you don't know the law,
you know the terminology.

00:10:57.515 --> 00:11:01.976
The first 2.5% of our population
are our innovators.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.213
The next 13.5% of our population
are our early adopters.

00:11:07.252 --> 00:11:09.096
The next 34% are your early majority,

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.453
your late majority and your laggards.

00:11:12.445 --> 00:11:14.976
The only reason these people
buy touch-tone phones

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.239
is because you can't buy
rotary phones anymore.

00:11:17.263 --> 00:11:18.976
(Laughter)

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.976
We all sit at various places
at various times on this scale,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.976
but what the law of diffusion
of innovation tells us

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.976
is that if you want mass-market success
or mass-market acceptance of an idea,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.976
you cannot have it
until you achieve this tipping point

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.976
between 15 and 18 percent
market penetration,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.976
and then the system tips.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.245
I love asking businesses,
"What's your conversion on new business?"

00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:45.902
They love to tell you,
"It's about 10 percent," proudly.

00:11:45.926 --> 00:11:48.069
Well, you can trip
over 10% of the customers.

00:11:48.093 --> 00:11:50.039
We all have about 10% who just "get it."

00:11:50.063 --> 00:11:51.776
That's how we describe them, right?

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.277
That's like that gut feeling,
"Oh, they just get it."

00:11:54.301 --> 00:11:56.737
The problem is: How do you
find the ones that get it

00:11:56.761 --> 00:11:59.405
before doing business
versus the ones who don't get it?

00:11:59.429 --> 00:12:02.976
So it's this here, this little gap
that you have to close,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.381
as Jeffrey Moore calls it,
"Crossing the Chasm" --

00:12:05.405 --> 00:12:08.976
because, you see, the early majority
will not try something

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.976
until someone else has tried it first.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.976
And these guys, the innovators
and the early adopters,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.191
they're comfortable
making those gut decisions.

00:12:18.215 --> 00:12:20.976
They're more comfortable
making those intuitive decisions

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.976
that are driven by what
they believe about the world

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.976
and not just what product is available.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.647
These are the people who stood
in line for six hours

00:12:29.671 --> 00:12:31.807
to buy an iPhone when they first came out,

00:12:31.831 --> 00:12:34.976
when you could have bought one
off the shelf the next week.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.143
These are the people
who spent 40,000 dollars

00:12:37.167 --> 00:12:39.976
on flat-screen TVs
when they first came out,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.309
even though the technology
was substandard.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.976
And, by the way, they didn't do it
because the technology was so great;

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.976
they did it for themselves.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.976
It's because they wanted to be first.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.477
People don't buy what you do;
they buy why you do it

00:12:53.501 --> 00:12:56.976
and what you do simply proves
what you believe.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.976
In fact, people will do the things
that prove what they believe.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.976
The reason that person bought the iPhone
in the first six hours,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.976
stood in line for six hours,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.381
was because of what they believed
about the world,

00:13:10.405 --> 00:13:12.405
and how they wanted everybody to see them:

00:13:12.429 --> 00:13:13.461
they were first.

00:13:13.485 --> 00:13:15.976
People don't buy what you do;
they buy why you do it.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.976
So let me give you a famous example,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.563
a famous failure and a famous success
of the law of diffusion of innovation.

00:13:22.587 --> 00:13:23.976
First, the famous failure.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.976
It's a commercial example.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.237
As we said before, the recipe for success

00:13:28.261 --> 00:13:31.653
is money and the right people
and the right market conditions.

00:13:31.677 --> 00:13:33.422
You should have success then.

00:13:33.446 --> 00:13:34.976
Look at TiVo.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.715
From the time TiVo came out
about eight or nine years ago

00:13:37.739 --> 00:13:38.977
to this current day,

00:13:39.001 --> 00:13:42.651
they are the single highest-quality
product on the market,

00:13:42.675 --> 00:13:44.548
hands down, there is no dispute.

00:13:45.595 --> 00:13:47.402
They were extremely well-funded.

00:13:47.426 --> 00:13:49.125
Market conditions were fantastic.

00:13:49.149 --> 00:13:50.976
I mean, we use TiVo as verb.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.259
I TiVo stuff on my piece-of-junk
Time Warner DVR all the time.

00:13:54.283 --> 00:13:56.326
(Laughter)

00:13:56.799 --> 00:13:58.976
But TiVo's a commercial failure.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.976
They've never made money.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.976
And when they went IPO,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.976
their stock was at about 30 or 40 dollars

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.429
and then plummeted,
and it's never traded above 10.

00:14:07.453 --> 00:14:09.976
In fact, I don't think
it's even traded above six,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.976
except for a couple of little spikes.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.334
Because you see, when TiVo
launched their product,

00:14:14.358 --> 00:14:16.976
they told us all what they had.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.454
They said, "We have a product
that pauses live TV,

00:14:20.478 --> 00:14:24.976
skips commercials, rewinds live TV
and memorizes your viewing habits

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.789
without you even asking."

00:14:28.175 --> 00:14:29.976
And the cynical majority said,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.976
"We don't believe you.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.548
We don't need it. We don't like it.

00:14:34.572 --> 00:14:35.635
You're scaring us."

00:14:36.691 --> 00:14:37.976
What if they had said,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.976
"If you're the kind of person
who likes to have total control

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.976
over every aspect of your life,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.976
boy, do we have a product for you.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.978
It pauses live TV, skips commercials,

00:14:51.002 --> 00:14:53.162
memorizes your viewing habits, etc., etc."

00:14:53.858 --> 00:14:56.372
People don't buy what you do;
they buy why you do it,

00:14:56.396 --> 00:14:59.757
and what you do simply serves
as the proof of what you believe.

00:15:00.559 --> 00:15:04.603
Now let me give you a successful example
of the law of diffusion of innovation.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.976
In the summer of 1963,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.976
250,000 people showed up
on the mall in Washington

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.652
to hear Dr. King speak.

00:15:16.154 --> 00:15:18.976
They sent out no invitations,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.976
and there was no website
to check the date.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.976
How do you do that?

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.143
Well, Dr. King
wasn't the only man in America

00:15:26.167 --> 00:15:28.570
who was a great orator.

00:15:28.594 --> 00:15:30.760
He wasn't the only man
in America who suffered

00:15:30.784 --> 00:15:32.562
in a pre-civil rights America.

00:15:32.586 --> 00:15:34.976
In fact, some of his ideas were bad.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.023
But he had a gift.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:40.231
He didn't go around telling people
what needed to change in America.

00:15:40.255 --> 00:15:42.572
He went around
and told people what he believed.

00:15:42.596 --> 00:15:45.976
"I believe, I believe, I believe,"
he told people.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.531
And people who believed what he believed

00:15:48.555 --> 00:15:51.976
took his cause, and they made it
their own, and they told people.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.048
And some of those people
created structures

00:15:54.072 --> 00:15:56.567
to get the word out to even more people.

00:15:56.591 --> 00:15:59.976
And lo and behold,
250,000 people showed up

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.246
on the right day at the right time
to hear him speak.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.502
How many of them showed up for him?

00:16:09.319 --> 00:16:10.351
Zero.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.976
They showed up for themselves.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.702
It's what they believed about America

00:16:15.726 --> 00:16:17.976
that got them to travel
in a bus for eight hours

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.976
to stand in the sun in Washington
in the middle of August.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.048
It's what they believed,
and it wasn't about black versus white:

00:16:24.072 --> 00:16:26.385
25% of the audience was white.

00:16:27.397 --> 00:16:31.000
Dr. King believed that there are
two types of laws in this world:

00:16:31.024 --> 00:16:34.976
those that are made by a higher authority
and those that are made by men.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.976
And not until all the laws
that are made by men

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.793
are consistent with the laws
made by the higher authority

00:16:40.817 --> 00:16:42.753
will we live in a just world.

00:16:42.777 --> 00:16:45.192
It just so happened
that the Civil Rights Movement

00:16:45.216 --> 00:16:48.976
was the perfect thing to help him
bring his cause to life.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.976
We followed, not for him,
but for ourselves.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.301
By the way, he gave
the "I have a dream" speech,

00:16:54.325 --> 00:16:56.310
not the "I have a plan" speech.

00:16:56.334 --> 00:16:59.976
(Laughter)

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.191
Listen to politicians now,
with their comprehensive 12-point plans.

00:17:03.215 --> 00:17:04.976
They're not inspiring anybody.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.976
Because there are leaders
and there are those who lead.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.976
Leaders hold a position
of power or authority,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
but those who lead inspire us.

00:17:16.533 --> 00:17:18.884
Whether they're individuals
or organizations,

00:17:18.908 --> 00:17:21.976
we follow those who lead,
not because we have to,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.837
but because we want to.

00:17:24.785 --> 00:17:29.223
We follow those who lead, not for them,
but for ourselves.

00:17:30.484 --> 00:17:32.976
And it's those who start with "why"

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.740
that have the ability
to inspire those around them

00:17:37.764 --> 00:17:39.975
or find others who inspire them.

00:17:41.216 --> 00:17:42.380
Thank you very much.

00:17:42.404 --> 00:17:44.000
(Applause)
