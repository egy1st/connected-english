00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
I've been playing TED for nearly a decade,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and I've very rarely played

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
any new songs of my own.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And that was largely because there weren't any.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
(Laughter)

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So I've been busy with a couple of projects,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and one of them was this:

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The Nutmeg.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
A 1930s ship's lifeboat,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
which I've been restoring in the garden

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
of my beach house in England.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And, so now,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
when the polar ice caps melt,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
my recording studio will rise up like an ark,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and I'll float off into the drowned world

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
like a character from a J.G. Ballard novel.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
During the day,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
the Nutmeg collects energy

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
from solar panels on the roof of the wheelhouse,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and from a 450 watt turbine

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
up the mast.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So that when it gets dark,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I've got plenty of power.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And I can light up the Nutmeg like a beacon.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And so I go in there until the early hours of the morning,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and I work on new songs.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I'd like to play to you guys,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
if you're willing to be the first audience to hear it.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
(Applause)

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
It's about Billie Holiday.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And it appears that,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
some night in 1947

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
she left her physical space

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and was missing all night,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
until she reappeared in the morning.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
But I know where she was.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
She was with me on my lifeboat.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And she was hot.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:55.000
(Music)

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
♫ Billie crept softly ♫

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
♫ into my waking arms ♫

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
♫ warm like a sip of sour mash ♫

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
♫ Strange fruit for ♫

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
♫ a sweet hunk of trash ♫

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
♫ Panic at the stage door ♫

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
♫ of Carnegie Hall ♫

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
♫ "Famous Jazz Singer Gone AWOL" ♫

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
♫ Must have left the building ♫

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
♫ body and soul ♫

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
♫ On a creaky ♫

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
♫ piano stool tonight ♫

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
♫ as the moon is my ♫

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
♫ only witness ♫

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
♫ She was breathing ♫

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
♫ in my ear ♫

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
♫ "This time it's love" ♫

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
♫ But love is a loaded pistol ♫

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
♫ By daybreak she's gone ♫

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
♫ Over the frozen river, home ♫

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
♫ Me and Johnny Walker ♫

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
♫ See in the new age ♫

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
♫ alone ♫

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
♫ Stay with me ♫

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
♫ again tonight ♫

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
♫ Billie, time, ♫

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
♫ time is a wily trickster ♫

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
♫ Still an echo ♫

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
♫ in my heart says, ♫

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
♫ "This time it's love" ♫

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:33.000
(Applause)
