00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I thought in getting up to my TED wish

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I would try to begin by putting in 
perspective what I try to do

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and how it fits with what they try to do.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We live in a world that everyone knows is interdependent,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
but insufficient in three major ways.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It is, first of all, profoundly unequal:

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
half the world's people still living on less than two dollars a day;

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
a billion people with no access to clean water;

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
two and a half billion no access to sanitation;

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
a billion going to bed hungry every night;

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
one in four deaths every year from AIDS, TB, malaria

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and the variety of infections associated with dirty water --

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
80 percent of them under five years of age.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Even in wealthy countries it is common now to see inequality growing.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
In the United States, since 2001 we've had five years of economic growth,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
five years of productivity growth in the workplace,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
but median wages are stagnant and the percentage of working families

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
dropping below the poverty line is up by four percent.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
The percentage of working families without health care up by four percent.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So this interdependent world which has been pretty good to most of us --

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
which is why we're all here in Northern California doing what we do

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
for a living, enjoying this evening -- is profoundly unequal.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
It is also unstable.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Unstable because of the threats of terror,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
weapons of mass destruction, the spread of global disease

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and a sense that we are vulnerable to it in a way that we weren't not so many years ago.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And perhaps most important of all, it is unsustainable

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
because of climate change, resource depletion and species destruction.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
When I think about the world I would like to leave to my daughter

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and the grandchildren I hope to have,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000
it is a world that moves away from unequal, unstable, unsustainable

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
interdependence to integrated communities -- locally, nationally and globally --

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
that share the characteristics of all successful communities:

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.000
a broadly shared, accessible set of opportunities,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
a shared sense of responsibility for the success of the common enterprise

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and a genuine sense of belonging.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
All easier said than done.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
When the terrorist incidents occurred in the United Kingdom a couple of years ago,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I think even though they didn't claim as many lives as we lost in the United States on 9/11,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
I think the thing that troubled the British most

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
was that the perpetrators were not invaders, but homegrown citizens

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
whose religious and political identities were more important to them

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
than the people they grew up with, went to school with,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
worked with, shared weekends with, shared meals with.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
In other words, they thought their differences

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
were more important than their common humanity.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.000
It is the central psychological plague of humankind in the 21st century.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Into this mix, people like us, who are not in public office,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
have more power to do good than at any time in history,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
because more than half the world's people

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
live under governments they voted in and can vote out.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And even non-democratic governments are more sensitive to public opinion.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Because primarily of the power of the Internet,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000
people of modest means can band together and amass vast sums of money

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
that can change the world for some public good if they all agree.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
When the tsunami hit South Asia, the United States contributed 1.2 billion dollars.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
30 percent of our households gave.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Half of them gave over the Internet.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
The median contribution was somewhere around 57 dollars.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
And thirdly, because of the rise of non-governmental organizations.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000
They, businesses, other citizens' groups, have enormous power

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
to affect the lives of our fellow human beings.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
When I became president in 1993,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
there were none of these organizations in Russia.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
There are now a couple of hundred thousand.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
None in India. There are now at least a half a million active.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
None in China. There are now 250,000 registered with the government,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
probably twice again that many who are not registered for political reasons.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:57.000
When I organized my foundation, and I thought about the world as it is

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000
and the world that I hope to leave to the next generation,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and I tried to be realistic about what I had cared about all my life

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
that I could still have an impact on.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
I wanted to focus on activities

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:21.000
that would help to alleviate poverty, fight disease, combat climate change,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
bridge the religious, racial and other divides that torment the world,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
but to do it in a way that would either use

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.000
whatever particular skills we could put together in our group

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
to change the way some public good function was performed

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
so that it would sweep across the world more.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000
You saw one reference to that in what we were able to do with AIDS drugs.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
And I want to say that the head of our AIDS effort,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
and the person who also is primarily active in the wish I'll make tonight,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Ira Magaziner, is here with me and I want to thank him for everything he's done.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
He's over there.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
(Applause)

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.000
When I got out of office and was asked to work, first in the Caribbean,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
to try to help deal with the AIDS crisis,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
generic drugs were available for about 500 dollars a person a year.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
If you bought them in vast bulks,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
you could get them at a little under 400 dollars.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
The first country we went to work in, the Bahamas,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
was paying 3,500 dollars for these drugs.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
The market was so terribly disorganized

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
that they were buying this medicine through two agents

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
who were gigging them sevenfold.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
So the very first week we were working,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
we got the price down to 500 dollars.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
And all of a sudden, they could save seven times as many lives

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
for the same amount of money.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Then we went to work with the manufacturers of AIDS medicines,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
one of whom was cited in the film,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000
and negotiated a whole different change in business strategy,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
because even at 500 dollars, these drugs

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000
were being sold on a high-margin, low-volume, uncertain-payment basis.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
So we worked on improving the productivity of the operations

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
and the supply chain, and went to a low-margin, high-volume,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
absolutely certain-payment business.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
I joked that the main contribution we made

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000
to the battle against AIDS was to get the manufacturers

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000
to change from a jewelry store to a grocery store strategy.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
But the price went to 140 dollars from 500.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000
And pretty soon, the average price was 192 dollars.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Now we can get it for about 100 dollars.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Children's medicine was 600 dollars,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
because nobody could afford to buy any of it.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
We negotiated it down to 190.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Then, the French imposed their brilliantly conceived airline tax

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
to create a something called UNITAID,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
got a bunch of other countries to help.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
That children's medicine is now 60 dollars a person a year.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000
The only thing that is keeping us from basically saving the lives

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
of everybody who needs the medicine to stay alive

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
are the absence of systems necessary to diagnose, treat and care

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
for people and deliver this medicine.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000
We started a childhood obesity initiative with the Heart Association in America.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
We tried to do the same thing by negotiating industry-right deals

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
with the soft drink and the snack food industry to cut the caloric

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
and other dangerous content of food going to our children in the schools.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
We just reorganized the markets.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
And it occurred to me that in this whole non-governmental world,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000
somebody needs to be thinking about organizing public goods markets.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
And that is now what we're trying to do,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
and working with this large cities group to fight climate change,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
to negotiate huge, big, volume deals that will enable cities

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
which generate 75 percent of the world's greenhouse gases,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
to drastically and quickly reduce greenhouse gas emissions

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
in a way that is good economics.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
And this whole discussion as if it's some sort of economic burden,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000
is a mystery to me.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
I think it's a bird's nest on the ground.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000
When Al Gore won his well-deserved Oscar

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
for the "Inconvenient Truth" movie, I was thrilled,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
but I had urged him to make a second movie quickly.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
For those of you who saw "An Inconvenient Truth,"

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.000
the most important slide in the Gore lecture is the last one,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
which shows here's where greenhouse gases are going

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
if we don't do anything, here's where they could go.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And then there are six different categories

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
of things we can do to change the trajectory.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
We need a movie on those six categories.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
And all of you need to have it embedded in your brains

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
and to organize yourselves around it.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
So we're trying to do that.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
So organizing these markets is one thing we try to do.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Now we have taken on a second thing, and this gets to my wish.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
It has been my experience in working in developing countries

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
that while the headlines may all be -- the pessimistic headlines may say,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
well, we can't do this, that or the other thing because of corruption --

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000
I think incapacity is a far bigger problem in poor countries than corruption,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
and feeds corruption.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
We now have the money, given these low prices, to distribute

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
AIDS drugs all over the world to people we cannot presently reach.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Today these low prices are available in the 25 countries where we work,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
and in a total of 62 countries,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
and about 550,000 people are getting the benefits of them.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
But the money is there to reach others.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
The systems are not there to reach the people.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:49.000
So what we have been trying to do,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.000
working first in Rwanda and then in Malawi and other places --

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
but I want to talk about Rwanda tonight --

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:05.000
is to develop a model for rural health care in a very poor area

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
that can be used to deal with AIDS, TB, malaria, other infectious diseases,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
maternal and child health, and a whole range of health issues

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
poor people are grappling with in the developing world,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
that can first be scaled for the whole nation of Rwanda,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
and then will be a model that could literally

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
be implemented in any other poor country in the world.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And the test is: one, will it do the job?

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Will it provide high quality care?

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
And two, will it do it at a price

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
that will enable the country to sustain a health care system

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
without foreign donors after five to 10 years?

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Because the longer I deal with these problems,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
the more convinced I am that we have to --

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
whether it's economics, health, education, whatever --

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
we have to build systems.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
And the absence of systems that function

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
break the connection which got you all in this seat tonight.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
You think about whatever your life has been,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
however many obstacles you have faced in your life,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
at critical junctures you always knew

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
there was a predictable connection between the effort you exerted

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
and the result you achieved.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000
In a world with no systems, with chaos,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
everything becomes a guerilla struggle,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
and this predictability is not there.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
And it becomes almost impossible to save lives,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
educate kids, develop economies, whatever.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
The person, in my view,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
who has done the best job of this in the health care area,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
of building a system in a very poor area, is Dr. Paul Farmer,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000
who, many of you know, has worked for now 20 years with his group,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Partners in Health, primarily in Haiti where he started,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
but they've also worked in Russia, in Peru

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
and other places around the world.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
As poor as Haiti is, in the area where Farmer's clinic is active --

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
and they serve a catchment area far greater

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
than the medical professionals they have would indicate they could serve --

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:10.000
since 1988, they have not lost one person to tuberculosis, not one.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
And they've achieved a lot of other amazing health results.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
So when we decided to work in Rwanda

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
on trying to dramatically increase the income of the country and fight the AIDS problem,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
we wanted to build a healthcare network,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000
because it had been totally destroyed during the genocide in 1994,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
and the per capita income was still under a dollar a day.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
So I rang up, asked Paul Farmer if he would help.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
Because it seemed to me if we could prove there was a model in Haiti

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
and a model in Rwanda that we could then take all over the country,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
number one, it would be a wonderful thing for a country

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
that has suffered as much as any on Earth in the last 15 years,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
and number two, we would have something that could then be adapted

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
to any other poor country anywhere in the world.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
And so we have set about doing that.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Now, we started working together 18 months ago.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000
And we're working in an area called Southern Kayonza,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
which is one of the poorest areas in Rwanda,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:22.000
with a group that originally includes about 400,000 people.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000
We're essentially implementing what Paul Farmer did in Haiti:

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
he develops and trains paid community health workers

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
who are able to identify health problems,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
ensure that people who have AIDS or TB are properly diagnosed

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
and take their medicine regularly,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:49.000
who work on bringing about health education, clean water and sanitation,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000
providing nutritional supplements and moving people up the chain of health care

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
if they have problems of the severity that require it.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
The procedures that make this work have been perfected,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
as I said, by Paul Farmer and his team

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
in their work in rural Haiti over the last 20 years.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Recently we did an evaluation of the first 18 months of our efforts in Rwanda.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000
And the results were so good that the Rwandan government

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
has now agreed to adopt the model for the entire country,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
and has strongly supported and put the full resources of the government behind it.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
I'll tell you a little bit about our team because it's indicative of what we do.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
We have about 500 people around the world

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
working in our AIDS program, some of them for nothing --

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
just for transportation, room and board.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
And then we have others working in these other related programs.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Our business plan in Rwanda

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
was put together under the leadership of Diana Noble,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
who is an unusually gifted woman,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000
but not unusual in the type of people who have been willing to do this kind of work.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000
She was the youngest partner at Schroder Ventures in London in her 20s.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
She was CEO of a successful e-venture --

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
she started and built Reed Elsevier Ventures --

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
and at 45 she decided she wanted to do something different with her life.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000
So she now works full-time on this for very little pay.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
She and her team of former business people have created a business plan

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
that will enable us to scale this health system up for the whole country.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000
And it would be worthy of the kind of private equity work

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
she used to do when she was making a lot more money for it.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000
When we came to this rural area, 45 percent of the children under the age of five

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000
had stunted growth due to malnutrition.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:50.000
23 percent of them died before they reached the age of five.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Mortality at birth was over two-and-a-half percent.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000
Over 15 percent of the deaths among adults and children occurred

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000
because of intestinal parasites and diarrhea from dirty water and inadequate sanitation --

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
all entirely preventable and treatable.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
Over 13 percent of the deaths were from respiratory illnesses --

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
again, all preventable and treatable.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000
And not a single soul in this area was being treated for AIDS or tuberculosis.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Within the first 18 months, the following things happened:

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
we went from zero to about 2,000 people being treated for AIDS.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000
That's 80 percent of the people who need treatment in this area.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Listen to this: less than four-tenths of one percent of those being treated

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
stopped taking their medicine or otherwise defaulted on treatment.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
That's lower than the figure in the United States.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Less than three-tenths of one percent

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000
had to transfer to the more expensive second-line drugs.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
400,000 pregnant women were brought into counseling

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.000
and will give birth for the first time within an organized healthcare system.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.000
That's about 43 percent of all the pregnancies.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000
About 40 percent of all the people -- I said 400,000. I meant 40,000.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000
About 40 percent of all the people who need TB treatment are now getting it --

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
in just 18 months, up from zero when we started.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
43 percent of the children in need of an infant feeding program

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
to prevent malnutrition and early death

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
are now getting the food supplements they need to stay alive and to grow.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000
We've started the first malaria treatment programs they've ever had there.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Patients admitted to a hospital that was destroyed during the genocide

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000
that we have renovated along with four other clinics,

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000
complete with solar power generators, good lab technology.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.000
We now are treating 325 people a month,

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000
despite the fact that almost 100 percent of the AIDS patients are now treated at home.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
And the most important thing is

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000
because we've implemented Paul Farmer's model, using community health workers,

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:09.000
we estimate that this system could be put into place for all of Rwanda

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000
for between five and six percent of GDP,

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
and that the government could sustain that

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000
without depending on foreign aid after five or six years.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
And for those of you who understand healthcare economics

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000
you know that all wealthy countries spend between nine and 11 percent of GDP

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
on health care, except for the United States, we spend 16 --

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
but that's a story for another day.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.000
(Laughter)

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000
We're now working with Partners in Health and the Ministry of Health in Rwanda

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
and our Foundation folks to scale this system up.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:52.000
We're also beginning to do this in Malawi and Lesotho.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
And we have similar projects in Tanzania, Mozambique,

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:01.000
Kenya and Ethiopia with other partners trying to achieve the same thing:

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
to save as many lives as quickly as we can,

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000
but to do it in a systematic way that can be implemented nationwide

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000
and then with a model that can be implemented in any country in the world.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
We need initial upfront investment to train doctors, nurses,

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000
health administration and community health workers throughout the country,

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
to set up the information technology, the solar energy,

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
the water and sanitation, the transportation infrastructure.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
But over a five- to 10-year period,

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
we will take down the need for outside assistance

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
and eventually it will be phased out.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:39.000
My wish is that TED assist us in our work and help us to build

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
a high-quality rural health system in a poor country, Rwanda,

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
that can be a model for Africa,

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.000
and indeed, for any poor country anywhere in the world.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:56.000
My belief is that this will help us to build a more integrated world

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
with more partners and fewer terrorists,

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000
with more productive citizens and fewer haters,

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.000
a place we'd all want our kids and our grandchildren to grow up in.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:14.000
It has been an honor for me, particularly, to work in Rwanda

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
where we also have a major economic development project

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000
in partnership with Sir Tom Hunter, the Scottish philanthropist,

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
where last year we, using the same thing with AIDS drugs,

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:31.000
cut the cost of fertilizer and the interest rates on microcredit loans by 30 percent

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000
and achieved three- to four-hundred percent increases

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
in crop yields with the farmers.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:43.000
These people have been through a lot and none of us, most of all me,

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000
helped them when they were on the verge of destroying each other.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:53.000
We're undoing that now, and they are so over it and so into their future.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
We're doing this in an environmentally responsible way.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000
I'm doing my best to convince them not to run the electric grid

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000
to the 35 percent of the people that have no access,

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.000
but to do it with clean energy. To have responsible reforestation projects,

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000
the Rwandans, interestingly enough, have been quite good, Mr. Wilson,

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000
in preserving their topsoil.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000
There's a couple of guys from southern farming families --

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
the first thing I did when I went out to this place

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
was to get down on my hands and knees and dig in the dirt

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
and see what they'd done with it.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000
We have a chance here to prove that a country

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.000
that almost slaughtered itself out of existence

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:42.000
can practice reconciliation, reorganize itself, focus on tomorrow

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:49.000
and provide comprehensive, quality health care with minimal outside help.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:55.000
I am grateful for this prize, and I will use it to that end.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000
We could use some more help to do this,

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000
but think of what it would mean if we could have a world-class health system

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000
in Rwanda -- in a country with a less-than-one-dollar-a-day-per-capita income,

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000
one that could save hundreds of millions of lives

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:19.000
over the next decade if applied to every similarly situated country on Earth.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.000
It's worth a try and I believe it would succeed.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000
Thank you and God bless you.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:38.000
(Applause)
