WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm an ecologist,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
mostly a coral reef ecologist.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I started out in Chesapeake Bay

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and went diving in the winter

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and became a tropical ecologist overnight.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And it was really a lot of fun

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
for about 10 years.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I mean, somebody pays you

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
to go around and travel

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and look at some of the most

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
beautiful places on the planet.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And that was what I did.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And I ended up in Jamaica,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
in the West Indies,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
where the coral reefs were really

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
among the most extraordinary, structurally,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
that I ever saw in my life.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And this picture here,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
it's really interesting, it shows two things:

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
First of all, it's in black and white

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
because the water was so clear

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and you could see so far,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and film was so slow

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
in the 1960s and early 70s,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
you took pictures in black and white.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
The other thing it shows you

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
is that, although there's this beautiful

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
forest of coral,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
there are no fish in that picture.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Those reefs at Discovery Bay, Jamaica

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
were the most studied coral reefs

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
in the world for 20 years.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
We were the best and the brightest.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
People came to study our reefs from Australia,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
which is sort of funny

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
because now we go to theirs.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And the view of scientists

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
about how coral reefs work, how they ought to be,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
was based on these reefs

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
without any fish.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Then, in 1980,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
there was a hurricane, Hurricane Allen.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I put half the lab

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
up in my house.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
The wind blew very strong.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
The waves were 25

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
to 50 feet high.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And the reefs disappeared, and new islands formed,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and we thought, "Well, we're real smart.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
We know that hurricanes

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
have always happened in the past."

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And we published a paper in Science,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
the first time that anybody ever

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
described the destruction

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
on a coral reef by a major hurricane.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And we predicted what would happen,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and we got it all wrong.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And the reason was

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
because of overfishing,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and the fact that a last common grazer,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
a sea urchin, died.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And within a few months

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
after that sea urchin dying, the seaweed started to grow.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
And that is the same reef;

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
that's the same reef 15 years ago;

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
that's the same reef today.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
The coral reefs of the north coast of Jamaica

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
have a few percent live coral cover

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and a lot of seaweed and slime.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And that's more or less the story

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
of the coral reefs of the Caribbean,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and increasingly, tragically,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
the coral reefs worldwide.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Now, that's my little, depressing story.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
All of us in our 60s and 70s

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
have comparable depressing stories.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
There are tens of thousands

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
of those stories out there,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and it's really hard to conjure up

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
much of a sense of well-being,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
because it just keeps getting worse.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And the reason it keeps getting worse

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
is that after a natural catastrophe,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
like a hurricane,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
it used to be that there was

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
some kind of successional sequence of recovery,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
but what's going on now is that

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
overfishing and pollution and climate change

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
are all interacting

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
in a way that prevents that.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And so I'm going to sort of go through

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
and talk about those three

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
kinds of things.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
We hear a lot about

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
the collapse of cod.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
It's difficult to imagine that

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
two, or some historians would say three world wars

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
were fought during the colonial era

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
for the control of cod.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Cod fed most of the people of Western Europe.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
It fed the slaves

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
brought to the Antilles,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
the song "Jamaica Farewell" --

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
"Ackee rice salt fish are nice" --

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
is an emblem of the importance

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
of salt cod from northeastern Canada.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
It all collapsed in the 80s and the 90s:

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
35,000 people lost their jobs.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And that was the beginning

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
of a kind of serial depletion

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
from bigger and tastier species

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
to smaller and not-so-tasty species,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
from species that were near to home

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
to species that were all around the world,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
and what have you.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
It's a little hard to understand that,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
because you can go to a Costco in the United States

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
and buy cheap fish.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
You ought to read the label to find out where it came from,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
but it's still cheap,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
and everybody thinks it's okay.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
It's hard to communicate this,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
and one way that I think is really interesting

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
is to talk about sport fish,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
because people like to go out and catch fish.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
It's one of those things.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
This picture here shows the trophy fish,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
the biggest fish caught

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
by people who pay a lot of money

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
to get on a boat,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
go to a place off of Key West in Florida,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
drink a lot of beer,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
throw a lot of hooks and lines into the water,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
come back with the biggest and the best fish,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
and the champion trophy fish

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
are put on this board, where people take a picture,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
and this guy is obviously

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
really excited about that fish.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Well, that's what it's like now,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
but this is what it was like in the 1950s

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
from the same boat in the same place

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
on the same board on the same dock.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
The trophy fish

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
were so big

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
that you couldn't put any of those small fish up on it.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And the average size trophy fish

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
weighed 250 to 300 pounds, goliath grouper,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and if you wanted to go out and kill something,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
you could pretty much count on

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
being able to catch one of those fish.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
And they tasted really good.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
And people paid less in 1950 dollars

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
to catch that

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
than what people pay now

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
to catch those little, tiny fish.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
And that's everywhere.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
It's not just the fish, though,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
that are disappearing.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Industrial fishing uses big stuff,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
big machinery.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
We use nets that are 20 miles long.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
We use longlines

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
that have one million or two million hooks.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And we trawl,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
which means to take something

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
the size of a tractor trailer truck

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
that weighs thousands and thousands of pounds,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
put it on a big chain,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
and drag it across the sea floor

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
to stir up the bottom and catch the fish.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Think of it as

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
being kind of the bulldozing of a city

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
or of a forest,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
because it clears it away.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And the habitat destruction

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
is unbelievable.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
This is a photograph,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
a typical photograph,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
of what the continental shelves

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
of the world look like.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
You can see the rows in the bottom,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
the way you can see the rows

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
in a field that has just been plowed

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
to plant corn.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
What that was, was a forest of sponges and coral,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
which is a critical habitat

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
for the development of fish.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
What it is now is mud,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
and the area of the ocean floor

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
that has been transformed from forest

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
to level mud, to parking lot,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
is equivalent to the entire area

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
of all the forests

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
that have ever been cut down

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
on all of the earth

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
in the history of humanity.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
We've managed to do that

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
in the last 100 to 150 years.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
We tend to think of oil spills

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
and mercury

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
and we hear a lot about plastic these days.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
And all of that stuff is really disgusting,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
but what's really insidious

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
is the biological pollution that happens

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
because of the magnitude of the shifts

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
that it causes

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
to entire ecosystems.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
And I'm going to just talk very briefly

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
about two kinds of biological pollution:

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
one is introduced species

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
and the other is what comes from nutrients.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
So this is the infamous

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Caulerpa taxifolia,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
the so-called killer algae.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
A book was written about it.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
It's a bit of an embarrassment.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
It was accidentally released

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
from the aquarium in Monaco,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
it was bred to be cold tolerant

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
to have in peoples aquaria.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
It's very pretty,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
and it has rapidly started

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
to overgrow

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
the once very rich

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
biodiversity of the

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
northwestern Mediterranean.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
I don't know how many of you remember the movie

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
"The Little Shop of Horrors,"

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
but this is the plant of "The Little Shop of Horrors."

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
But, instead of devouring the people in the shop,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
what it's doing is overgrowing

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
and smothering

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
virtually all of the bottom-dwelling life

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
of the entire northwestern

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Mediterranean Sea.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
We don't know anything that eats it,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
we're trying to do all sorts of genetics

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
and figure out something that could be done,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
but, as it stands, it's the monster from hell,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
about which nobody knows what to do.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Now another form of pollution

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
that's biological pollution

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
is what happens from excess nutrients.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
The green revolution,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
all of this artificial nitrogen fertilizer, we use too much of it.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
It's subsidized, which is one of the reasons we used too much of it.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
It runs down the rivers,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
and it feeds the plankton,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
the little microscopic plant cells

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
in the coastal water.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
But since we ate all the oysters

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
and we ate all the fish that would eat the plankton,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
there's nothing to eat the plankton

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
and there's more and more of it,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
so it dies of old age,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
which is unheard of for plankton.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
And when it dies, it falls to the bottom

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
and then it rots,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
which means that bacteria break it down.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
And in the process

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
they use up all the oxygen,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
and in using up all the oxygen

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
they make the environment utterly lethal

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
for anything that can't swim away.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
So, what we end up with

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
is a microbial zoo

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
dominated by bacteria

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
and jellyfish, as you see

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
on the left in front of you.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
And the only fishery left --

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
and it is a commercial fishery --

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
is the jellyfish fishery

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
you see on the right, where there used to be prawns.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Even in Newfoundland

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
where we used to catch cod,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
we now have a jellyfish fishery.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
And another version of this sort of thing

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
is what is often called red tides

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
or toxic blooms.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
That picture on the left is just staggering to me.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
I have talked about it a million times,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
but it's unbelievable.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
In the upper right of that picture on the left

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
is almost the Mississippi Delta,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
and the lower left of that picture

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
is the Texas-Mexico border.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
You're looking at the entire

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
northwestern Gulf of Mexico;

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
you're looking at one toxic

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
dinoflagellate bloom that can kill fish,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
made by that beautiful little creature

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
on the lower right.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
And in the upper right you see this

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
black sort of cloud

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
moving ashore.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
That's the same species.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
And as it comes to shore and the wind blows,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
and little droplets of the water get into the air,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
the emergency rooms of all the hospitals fill up

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
with people with acute respiratory distress.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
And that's retirement homes

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
on the west coast of Florida.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
A friend and I did this thing in Hollywood

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
we called Hollywood ocean night,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
and I was trying to figure out how to

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
explain to actors what's going on.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
And I said,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
"So, imagine you're in a movie called 'Escape from Malibu'

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
because all the beautiful people have moved

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
to North Dakota, where it's clean and safe.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
And the only people who are left there

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
are the people who can't afford

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
to move away from the coast,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
because the coast, instead of being paradise,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
is harmful to your health."

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
And then this is amazing.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
It was when I was on holiday last early autumn in France.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
This is from the coast of Brittany,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
which is being enveloped

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
in this green, algal slime.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
The reason that it attracted so much attention,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
besides the fact that it's disgusting,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
is that sea birds flying over it

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
are asphyxiated by the smell and die,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
and a farmer died of it,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
and you can imagine the scandal that happened.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
And so there's this war

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
between the farmers

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
and the fishermen about it all,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
and the net result is that

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
the beaches of Brittany have to be bulldozed of this stuff

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
on a regular basis.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
And then, of course, there's climate change,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
and we all know about climate change.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
I guess the iconic figure of it

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
is the melting of the ice

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
in the Arctic Sea.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Think about the thousands and thousands of people who died

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
trying to find the Northwest Passage.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Well, the Northwest Passage is already there.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
I think it's sort of funny;

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
it's on the Siberian coast,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
maybe the Russians will charge tolls.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
The governments of the world

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
are taking this really seriously.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
The military of the Arctic nations

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
is taking it really seriously.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
For all the denial of climate change

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
by government leaders,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
the CIA

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
and the navies of Norway

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
and the U.S. and Canada, whatever

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
are busily thinking about

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
how they will secure their territory

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
in this inevitability

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
from their point of view.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
And, of course, Arctic communities are toast.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
The other kinds of effects of climate change --

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
this is coral bleaching. It's a beautiful picture, right?

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
All that white coral.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Except it's supposed to be brown.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
What happens is that

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
the corals are a symbiosis,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
and they have these little algal cells

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
that live inside them.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
And the algae give the corals sugar,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
and the corals give the algae

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
nutrients and protection.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
But when it gets too hot,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
the algae can't make the sugar.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
The corals say, "You cheated. You didn't pay your rent."

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
They kick them out, and then they die.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Not all of them die; some of them survive,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
some more are surviving,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
but it's really bad news.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
To try and give you a sense of this,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
imagine you go camping in July

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
somewhere in Europe or in North America,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
and you wake up the next morning, and you look around you,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
and you see that 80 percent of the trees,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
as far as you can see,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
have dropped their leaves and are standing there naked.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
And you come home, and you discover

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
that 80 percent of all the trees

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
in North America and in Europe

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
have dropped their leaves.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
And then you read in the paper a few weeks later,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
"Oh, by the way, a quarter of those died."

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Well, that's what happened in the Indian Ocean

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
during the 1998 El Nino,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
an area vastly greater

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
than the size of North America and Europe,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
when 80 percent of all the corals bleached

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
and a quarter of them died.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
And then the really scary thing

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
about all of this --

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
the overfishing, the pollution and the climate change --

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
is that each thing doesn't happen in a vacuum.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
But there are these, what we call, positive feedbacks,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
the synergies among them

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
that make the whole vastly greater

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
than the sum of the parts.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
And the great scientific challenge

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
for people like me in thinking about all this,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
is do we know how

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
to put Humpty Dumpty back together again?

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
I mean, because we, at this point, we can protect it.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
But what does that mean?

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
We really don't know.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
So what are the oceans going to be like

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
in 20 or 50 years?

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Well, there won't be any fish

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
except for minnows,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
and the water will be pretty dirty,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
and all those kinds of things

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
and full of mercury, etc., etc.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
And dead zones will get bigger and bigger

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
and they'll start to merge,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
and we can imagine something like

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
the dead-zonification

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
of the global, coastal ocean.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Then you sure won't want to eat fish that were raised in it,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
because it would be a kind of

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
gastronomic Russian roulette.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Sometimes you have a toxic bloom;

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
sometimes you don't.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
That doesn't sell.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
The really scary things though

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
are the physical, chemical,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
oceanographic things that are happening.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
As the surface of the ocean gets warmer,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
the water is lighter when it's warmer,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
it becomes harder and harder

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
to turn the ocean over.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
We say it becomes

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
more strongly stratified.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
The consequence of that is that

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
all those nutrients

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
that fuel the great anchoveta fisheries,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
of the sardines of California

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
or in Peru or whatever,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
those slow down

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
and those fisheries collapse.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
And, at the same time,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
water from the surface, which is rich in oxygen,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
doesn't make it down

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
and the ocean turns into a desert.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
So the question is: How are we all

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
going to respond to this?

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
And we can do

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
all sorts of things to fix it,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
but in the final analysis,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
the thing we really need to fix

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
is ourselves.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
It's not about the fish; it's not about the pollution;

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
it's not about the climate change.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
It's about us

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
and our greed and our need for growth

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
and our inability to imagine a world

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
that is different from the selfish world

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
we live in today.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
So the question is: Will we respond to this or not?

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
I would say that the future of life

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
and the dignity of human beings

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
depends on our doing that.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
Thank you. (Applause)
