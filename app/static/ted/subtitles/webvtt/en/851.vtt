00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I bring to you

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
a message from

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
tens of thousands of people --

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
in the villages, in the slums,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
in the hinterland of the country --

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
who have solved problems

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
through their own genius,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
without any

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
outside help.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
When our home minister announces

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
a few weeks ago

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
a war on

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
one third of India,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
about 200 districts that he mentioned

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
were ungovernable,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
he missed the point.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
The point that we have been stressing

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
for the last 21 years,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
the point that

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
people may be economically poor,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
but they're not poor in the mind.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
In other words,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
the minds on the margin

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
are not the marginal minds.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
That is the message,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
which we started 31 years ago.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And what did it start?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Let me just tell you, briefly, my personal journey,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
which led me to come to this point.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
In '85, '86, I was in Bangladesh

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
advising the government and the research council there

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
how to help scientists work on the lands,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
on the fields of the poor people,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and how to develop research technologies,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
which are based on the knowledge of the people.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I came back in '86.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I had been tremendously invigorated

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
by the knowledge and creativity that I found in that country,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
which had 60 percent landlessness

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
but amazing creativity.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I started looking at my own work:

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
The work that I had done

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
for the previous 10 years,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
almost every time,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
had instances of knowledge

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
that people had shared.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Now, I was paid in dollars as a consultant,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and I looked at my income tax return

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and tried to ask myself: "Is there a line in my return,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
which shows how much of this income has gone

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
to the people whose knowledge

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
has made it possible?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Was it because I'm brilliant

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
that I'm getting this reward, or because of the revolution?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Is it that I write very well?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Is it that I articulate very well?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Is it that I analyze the data very well?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Is it because I'm a professor, and, therefore,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I must be entitled to this reward from society?"

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I tried to convince myself that, "No, no,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I have worked for the policy changes.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
You know, the public policy will become

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
more responsive to the needs of the poor,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
and, therefore I think it's okay."

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
But it appeared to me

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
that all these years that I'd been working on exploitation --

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
exploitation by landlords,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
by moneylenders, by traders --

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
gave me an insight that

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
probably I was also an exploiter,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
because there was no line in my income tax return

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
which showed this income accrued

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
because of the brilliance of the people --

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
those people who have shared their knowledge and good faith and trust with me --

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and nothing ever went back to them.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
So much so, that much of my work till that time

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
was in the English language.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
The majority of the people from whom I learned didn't know English.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
So what kind of a contributor was I?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I was talking about social justice,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and here I was, a professional

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
who was pursuing the most unjust act --

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
of taking knowledge from the people, making them anonymous,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
getting rent from that knowledge

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
by sharing it and doing consultancy, writing papers and

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
publishing them in the papers,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
getting invited to the conferences,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
getting consultancies and whatever have you.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
So then, a dilemma rose in the mind that,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
if I'm also an exploiter, then this is not right;

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
life cannot go on like that.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And this was a moment of great pain and trauma

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
because I couldn't live with it any longer.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
So I did a review of

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
ethical dilemma and value conflicts and management research,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
wrote, read about 100 papers.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And I came to the conclusion that

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
while dilemma is unique,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
dilemma is not unique; the solution had to be unique.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And one day -- I don't know what happened --

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
while coming back from the office towards home,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
maybe I saw a honey bee

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
or it occurred to my mind that if I only could be like the honey bee,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
life would be wonderful.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
What the honey bee does: it pollinates,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
takes nectar from the flower,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
pollinates another flower, cross-pollinates.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And when it takes the nectar,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
the flowers don't feel shortchanged.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
In fact, they invite the honey bees

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
through their colors,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
and the bees don't keep all the honey for themselves.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
These are the three guiding principles of the Honey Bee Network:

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
that whenever we learn something from people

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
it must be shared with them in their language.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
They must not remain anonymous.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
And I must tell you that after 20 years,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
I have not made one percent of change

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
in the professional practice of this art.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
That is a great tragedy -- which I'm carrying still with me

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
and I hope that all of you will carry this with you --

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
that the profession still legitimizes publication

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
of knowledge of people without attributing them

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
by making them anonymous.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
The research guidelines of U.S. National Academy of Sciences

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
or Research Councils of the U.K.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
or of Indian Councils of Science Research

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
do not require

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
that whatever you learn from people, you must share back with them.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
We are talking about an accountable society,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
a society that is fair and just,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
and we don't even do justice in the knowledge market.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
And India wants to be a knowledge society.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
How will it be a knowledge society?

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
So, obviously, you cannot have two principles of justice,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
one for yourself and one for others.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
It must be the same.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
You cannot discriminate.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
You cannot be in favor of your own values,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
which are at a distance from

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
the values that you espouse.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
So, fairness to one and to the other

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
is not divisible.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Look at this picture.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Can you tell me where has it been taken from,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and what is it meant for? Anybody?

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
I'm a professor; I must quiz you. (Laughter)

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Anybody? Any guess at all?

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Pardon? (Audience Member: Rajasthan.)

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Anil Gupta: But what has it been used for? What has it been used for?

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
(Murmuring)

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Pardon?

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
You know, you're so right. We must give him a hand,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
because this man knows how insensitive our government is.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Look at this. This is the site of the government of India.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
It invites tourists

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
to see the shame of our country.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
I'm so sorry to say that.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Is this a beautiful picture

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
or is it a terrible picture?

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
It depends upon how you look at the life of the people.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
If this woman has to carry water on her head

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
for miles and miles and miles,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
you cannot be celebrating that.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
We should be doing something about it.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
And let me tell you, with all the science and technology at our command,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
millions of women still carry water on their heads.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And we do not ask this question.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
You must have taken tea in the morning.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Think for a minute.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
The leaves of the tea, plucked from the bushes;

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
you know what the action is? The action is:

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
The lady picks up a few leaves, puts them in the basket on the backside.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Just do it 10 times;

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
you will realize the pain in this shoulder.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And she does it a few thousand times

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
every day.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
The rice that you ate in the lunch, and you will eat today,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
is transplanted by women

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
bending in a very awkward posture,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
millions of them,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
every season, in the paddy season,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
when they transplant paddy

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
with their feet in the water.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
And feet in the water will develop fungus,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
infections,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and that infection pains

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
because then other insects bite that point.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
And every year,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
99.9 percent of the paddy is transplanted manually.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
No machines have been developed.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
So the silence of scientists,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
of technologists, of public policy makers,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
of the change agent, drew our attention that this is not on, this is not on;

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
this is not the way society will work.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
This is not what our parliament would do. You know,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
we have a program for employment:

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
One hundred, 250 million people

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
have to be given jobs for 100 days by this great country.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Doing what? Breaking stones, digging earth.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
So we asked a question to the parliament:

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Do poor have heads?

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Do poor have legs, mouth and hands, but no head?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
So Honey Bee Network builds upon the resource in which poor people are rich.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And what has happened?

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
An anonymous, faceless, nameless person

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
gets in contact with the network,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
and then gets an identity.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
This is what Honey Bee Network is about.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
And this network grew voluntarily,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
continues to be voluntary,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
and has tried to map the minds

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
of millions of people

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
of our country and other parts of the world who are creative.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
They could be creative in terms of education,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
they may be creative in terms of culture,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
they may be creative in terms of institutions;

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
but a lot of our work is in the field of technological creativity,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
the innovations,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
either in terms of contemporary innovations,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
or in terms of traditional knowledge.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
And it all begins with curiosity.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
It all begins with curiosity.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
This person, whom we met -- and you will see it on the website,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
www.sristi.org -- this tribal person,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
he had a wish.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
And he said, "If my wish gets fulfilled" --

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
somebody was sick and he had to monitor --

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
"God, please cure him.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
And if you cure him, I will get my wall painted."

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
And this is what he got painted.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Somebody was talking yesterday about Maslowian hierarchy.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
There could be nothing more wrong than

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
the Maslowian model of hierarchy of needs

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
because the poorest people in this country can get enlightenment.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Kabir, Rahim, all the great Sufi saints,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
they were all poor people,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
and they had a great reason. (Applause)

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Please do not ever think that

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
only after meeting your physiological needs and other needs

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
can you be thinking about your spiritual needs or your enlightenment.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Any person anywhere is capable

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
of rising to that highest point of attainment,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
only by the resolve that they have in their mind that they must achieve something.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Look at this.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
We saw it in Shodh Yatra. Every six months we walk

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
in different parts of the country.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
I've walked about 4,000 kilometers in the last 12 years.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
So on the wayside

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
we found these dung cakes,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
which are used as a fuel.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Now, this lady, on the wall of the dung cake heap,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
has made a painting.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
That's the only space she could express her creativity.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
And she's so marvelous.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Look at this lady, Ram Timari Devi,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
on a grain bin. In Champaran, we had a Shodh Yatra

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
and we were walking

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
in the land where Gandhiji went

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
to hear about the tragedy, pain

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
of indigo growers.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Bhabi Mahato in Purulia and Bankura.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Look at what she has done.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
The whole wall is her canvas. She's sitting there with a broom.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Is she an artisan or an artist?

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Obviously she's an artist; she's a creative person.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
If we can create markets for these artists,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
we will not have to employ them for digging earth and breaking stones.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
They will be paid for what they are good at, not what they're bad at.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
(Applause)

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Look at what Rojadeen has done.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
In Motihari in Champaran,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
there are a lot of people who sell tea on the shack

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
and, obviously, there's a limited market for tea.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Every morning you have tea, as well as coffee.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
So he thought, why don't I convert

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
a pressure cooker into a coffee machine?

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
So this is a coffee machine. Just takes a few hundred rupees.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
People bring their own cooker,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
he attaches a valve and a steam pipe,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
and now he gives you espresso coffee. (Laughter)

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Now, this is a real, affordable

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
coffee percolator that works on gas.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
(Applause)

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Look at what Sheikh Jahangir has done.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
A lot of poor people do not have

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
enough grains to get ground.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
So this fellow is bringing

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
a flour-grinding machine on a two-wheeler.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
If you have 500 grams, 1000, one kilogram,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
he will grind it for it for you; the flourmill will not grind such a small quantity.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Please understand the problem of poor people.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
They have needs which

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
have to be met efficiently

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
in terms of energy, in terms of cost, in terms of quality.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
They don't want second-standard, second-quality outputs.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
But to be able to give them high-quality output

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
you need to adapt technology to their needs.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
And that is what Sheikh Jahangir did.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
But that's not enough, what he did. Look at what he did here.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
If you have clothes, and you don't have enough time to wash them,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
he brought a washing machine

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
to your doorstep, mounted on a two-wheeler.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
So here's a model where

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
a two-wheeler washing machine ...

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
He is washing your clothes and drying them at your doorstep.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
(Applause)

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
You bring your water, you bring your soap,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
I wash the clothes for you. Charge 50 paisa, one rupee

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
for you per lot,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
and a new business model can emerge.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Now, what we need is, we need

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
people who will be able to scale them up.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Look at this.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
It looks like a beautiful photograph.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
But you know what it is? Can anybody guess what it is?

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Somebody from India would know, of course.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
It's a tawa.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
It's a hot plate made of clay.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Now, what is the beauty in it?

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
When you have a non-stick pan,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
it costs about,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
maybe, 250 rupees,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
five dollars, six dollars.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
This is less than a dollar

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
and this is non-stick;

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
it is coated with one of these

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
food-grade materials.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
And the best part is that,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
while you use a costly non-stick pan,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
you eat the so-called Teflon

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
or Teflon-like material

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
because after some time the stuff disappears. Where has it gone?

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
It has gone in your stomach. It was not meant for that. (Laughter)

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
You know? But here

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
in this clay hot plate,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
it will never go into your stomach.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
So it is better, it is safer;

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
it is affordable, it is energy-efficient.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
In other words, solutions by the poor people need not be cheaper,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
need not be, so-called, jugaad, need not be some kind of makeshift arrangement.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
They have to be better, they have to be more efficient,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
they have to be affordable.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
And that is what Mansukh Bhai Prajapati has done.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
He has designed this plate with a handle.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
And now with one dollar,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
you can afford a better alternative

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
than the people market is offering you.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
This lady, she developed

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
a herbal pesticide formulation.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
We filed the patent for her,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
the National Innovation Foundation.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
And who knows? Somebody will license this technology

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
and develop marketable products,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
and she would get revenue.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Now, let me mention one thing:

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
I think we need a polycentric model of development,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
where a large number of initiatives in different parts of the country,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
in different parts of the world,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
would solve the needs of locality

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
in a very efficient and adaptive manner.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Higher the local fit,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
greater is the chance of scaling up.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
In the scaling up,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
there's an inherent inadequacy

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
to match the needs of the local people,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
point by point, with the supply that you're making.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
So why are people willing to adjust with that mismatch?

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Things can scale up, and they have scaled up.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
For example, cell phones: We have 400 million cellphones in this country.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Now, it is possible that I use only two buttons on the cellphone,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
only three options on the cellphone.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
It has 300 options, I'm paying for 300; I'm using only three

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
but I'm willing to live with it, therefore it is scaling up.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
But if I had to get a match to match,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
obviously, I would need a different design of a cellphone.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
So what we're saying is that scalability

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
should not become an enemy of sustainability.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
There must be a place in the world

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
for solutions that are only relevant for a locality,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
and yet, one can be able to fund them.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
One of the greatest studies that we've been finding is

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
that many times investors would ask this question --

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
"What is a scalable model?" --

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
as if the need of a community, which is only

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
located in a space and time

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
and has those needs only located in those places,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
has no legitimate right to get them for free

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
because it's not part of a larger scale.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
So either you sub-optimize your needs to a larger scale

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
or else you remain out.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Now, the eminent model, the long-tail model

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
tells you that small sales

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
of a large number of books, for example,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
having only a few copies sold

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
can still be a viable model.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
And we must find a mechanism where

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
people will pool in the portfolio, will invest in the portfolio,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
where different innovations will go to

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
a small number of people in their localities,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
and yet, the overall platform of the model will become viable.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
Look at what he is doing.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Saidullah Sahib is an amazing man.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
At the age of 70,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
he is linking up something very creative.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000
(Music)

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
Saidullah Sahib: I couldn't wait for the boat.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
I had to meet my love.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
My desperation made me an innovator.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Even love needs help from technology.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Innovation is the light of my wife, Noor.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
New inventions are the passion of my life.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
My technology.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:51.000
(Applause)

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
AG: Saidulluh Sahib is

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
in Motihari, again in Champaran.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Wonderful human being,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
but he stills sells, at this age,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
honey on a cycle to earn his livelihood,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
because we haven't been able to convince the water park people,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
the lake people, in [unclear] operations.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
And we have not been able to convince the fire brigade people

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
in Mumbai -- where there was a flood a few years ago

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
and people had to walk 20 kilometers, wading in the water --

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
that, look, you should have this cycle in your fire brigade office

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
because you can then go to those lanes

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
where your buses will not go, where your transport will not go.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
So we have not yet cracked the problem

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
of making it available as a rescue device,

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
as a vending device during the floods in eastern India,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
when you have to deliver things to people

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
in different islands

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
where they're marooned.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
But the idea has a merit. The idea has a merit.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
What has Appachan done? Appachan, unfortunately, is no more,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
but he has left behind a message.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
A very powerful message

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
Appachan: I watch the world wake up every day.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
(Music)

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
It's not that a coconut fell on my head,

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
and I came upon this idea.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
With no money to fund my studies,

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
I scaled new heights.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Now, they call me the local Spiderman.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
My technology.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000
(Applause)

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
AG: Many of you

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
might not realize and believe

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
that we have sold this product internationally --

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
what I call a G2G model,

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
grassroots to global.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
And a professor in the University of Massachusetts,

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
in the zoology department,

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
bought this climber because she wanted

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
to study the insect diversity

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
of the top of the tree canopy.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
And this device makes it possible

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
for her to take samples from a larger number of palms,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
rather than only a few,

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
because otherwise she had to make a big platform

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
and then climb her [unclear] would climb on that.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
So, you know, we are advancing the frontiers of science.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Remya Jose has developed ...

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
you can go to the YouTube and find India Innovates

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
and then you will find these videos.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Innovation by her when she was in class 10th:

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
a washing machine-cum-exercising machine.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
Mr. Kharai who is a physically challenged person,

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
one and a half foot height, only.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
But he has modified a two-wheeler so that he can get autonomy

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000
and freedom and flexibility.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000
This innovation is from the slums of Rio.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
And this person, Mr. Ubirajara.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
We were talking about, my friends in Brazil,

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
how we scale up this model in China and Brazil.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000
And we have a very vibrant network in China, particularly,

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000
but also emerging in Brazil and other parts of the world.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000
This stand on the front wheel, you will not find on any cycle.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
India and China have the largest number of cycles.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
But this innovation emerged in Brazil.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000
The point is, none of us should be parochial,

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
none of us should be so nationalistic to believe

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
that all good ideas will come only from our country.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
No, we have to have the humility to learn

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
from knowledge of economically poor people, wherever they are.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000
And look at this whole range of cycle-based innovations:

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
cycle that's a sprayer, cycle that

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
generates energy from the shocks on the road.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000
I can't change the condition of the road,

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
but I can make the cycle run faster.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
That is what Kanak Das has done.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
And in South Africa,

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
we had taken our innovators,

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000
and many of us had gone there share with the colleagues in South Africa

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000
as to how innovation can become

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
a means of liberation

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
from the drudgery that people have.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
And this is a donkey cart which they modified.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000
There's an axle here, of 30, 40 kg,

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
serving no purpose.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000
Remove it, the cart needs one donkey less.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
This is in China. This girl needed a breathing apparatus.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
These three people in the village

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
sat down and decided to think,

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
"How do we elongate the life of this girl of our village?"

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000
They were not related to her, but they tried to find out,

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
"How can we use ... "

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000
They used a cycle, they put together a breathing apparatus.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
And this breathing apparatus now saved the life,

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
and she's very welcome.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
There's a whole range of innovations that we have.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000
A car, which runs on compressed air

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
with six paisa per kilometer.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Assam, Kanak Gogoi.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
And you would not find this car in U.S. or Europe,

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
but this is available in India.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000
Now, this lady, she used to do the winding of the yarn

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000
for Pochampally Saree.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
In one day, 18,000 times,

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
she had to do this winding

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
to generate two sarees.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.000
This is what her son has done after seven years of struggle.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
She said, "Change your profession."

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
He said, "I can't. This is the only thing I know, but I'll invent a machine,

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000
which will solve your problem."

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000
And this is what he did, a sewing machine in Uttar Pradesh.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000
So, this is what SRISTI is saying:

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000
"Give me a place to stand, and I will move the world."

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
I will just tell you that we are also doing a competition among children

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
for creativity, a whole range of things.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000
We have sold things all over the world,

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000
from Ethiopia to Turkey to U.S. to wherever.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000
Products have gone to the market, a few.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000
These are the people whose knowledge made

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000
this Herbavate cream for eczema possible.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
And here, a company which licensed this herbal pesticide

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
put a photograph of the innovator on the packing

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
so that every time a user uses it,

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
it asks the user, "You can also be an innovator.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000
If you have an idea, send it back to us."

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.000
So, creativity counts, knowledge matters,

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000
innovations transform, incentives inspire.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000
And incentives: not just material, but also non-material incentives.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
Thank you.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:32.000
(Applause)
