WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
For me, this story begins about 15 years ago,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
when I was a hospice doctor at the University of Chicago.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And I was taking care of people who were dying and their families

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
in the South Side of Chicago.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And I was observing what happened to people and their families

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
over the course of their terminal illness.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And in my lab, I was studying the widower effect,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
which is a very old idea in the social sciences,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
going back 150 years,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
known as "dying of a broken heart."

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So, when I die, my wife's risk of death can double,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
for instance, in the first year.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And I had gone to take care of one particular patient,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
a woman who was dying of dementia.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And in this case, unlike this couple,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
she was being cared for

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
by her daughter.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And the daughter was exhausted from caring for her mother.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And the daughter's husband,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
he also was sick

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
from his wife's exhaustion.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And I was driving home one day,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and I get a phone call from the husband's friend,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
calling me because he was depressed

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
about what was happening to his friend.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So here I get this call from this random guy

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
that's having an experience

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
that's being influenced by people

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
at some social distance.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And so I suddenly realized two very simple things:

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
First, the widowhood effect

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
was not restricted to husbands and wives.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And second, it was not restricted to pairs of people.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And I started to see the world

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
in a whole new way,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
like pairs of people connected to each other.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And then I realized that these individuals

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
would be connected into foursomes with other pairs of people nearby.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And then, in fact, these people

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
were embedded in other sorts of relationships:

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
marriage and spousal

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and friendship and other sorts of ties.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And that, in fact, these connections were vast

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and that we were all embedded in this

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
broad set of connections with each other.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
So I started to see the world in a completely new way

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and I became obsessed with this.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I became obsessed with how it might be

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
that we're embedded in these social networks,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and how they affect our lives.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
So, social networks are these intricate things of beauty,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and they're so elaborate and so complex

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and so ubiquitous, in fact,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
that one has to ask what purpose they serve.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Why are we embedded in social networks?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
I mean, how do they form? How do they operate?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And how do they effect us?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So my first topic with respect to this,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
was not death, but obesity.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
It had become trendy

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
to speak about the "obesity epidemic."

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And, along with my collaborator, James Fowler,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
we began to wonder whether obesity really was epidemic

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
and could it spread from person to person

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
like the four people I discussed earlier.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
So this is a slide of some of our initial results.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
It's 2,200 people in the year 2000.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Every dot is a person. We make the dot size

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
proportional to people's body size;

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
so bigger dots are bigger people.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
In addition, if your body size,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
if your BMI, your body mass index, is above 30 --

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
if you're clinically obese --

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
we also colored the dots yellow.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
So, if you look at this image, right away you might be able to see

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
that there are clusters of obese and

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
non-obese people in the image.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
But the visual complexity is still very high.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
It's not obvious exactly what's going on.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
In addition, some questions are immediately raised:

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
How much clustering is there?

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Is there more clustering than would be due to chance alone?

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
How big are the clusters? How far do they reach?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And, most importantly,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
what causes the clusters?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
So we did some mathematics to study the size of these clusters.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
This here shows, on the Y-axis,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
the increase in the probability that a person is obese

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
given that a social contact of theirs is obese

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
and, on the X-axis, the degrees of separation between the two people.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
On the far left, you see the purple line.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
It says that, if your friends are obese,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
your risk of obesity is 45 percent higher.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And the next bar over, the [red] line,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
says if your friend's friends are obese,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
your risk of obesity is 25 percent higher.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
And then the next line over says

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
if your friend's friend's friend, someone you probably don't even know, is obese,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
your risk of obesity is 10 percent higher.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
And it's only when you get to your friend's friend's friend's friends

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
that there's no longer a relationship

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
between that person's body size and your own body size.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Well, what might be causing this clustering?

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
There are at least three possibilities:

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
One possibility is that, as I gain weight,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
it causes you to gain weight.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
A kind of induction, a kind of spread from person to person.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Another possibility, very obvious, is homophily,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
or, birds of a feather flock together;

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
here, I form my tie to you

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
because you and I share a similar body size.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
And the last possibility is what is known as confounding,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
because it confounds our ability to figure out what's going on.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And here, the idea is not that my weight gain

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
is causing your weight gain,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
nor that I preferentially form a tie with you

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
because you and I share the same body size,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
but rather that we share a common exposure

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
to something, like a health club

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
that makes us both lose weight at the same time.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
When we studied these data, we found evidence for all of these things,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
including for induction.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And we found that if your friend becomes obese,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
it increases your risk of obesity by about 57 percent

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
in the same given time period.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
There can be many mechanisms for this effect:

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
One possibility is that your friends say to you something like --

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
you know, they adopt a behavior that spreads to you --

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
like, they say, "Let's go have muffins and beer,"

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
which is a terrible combination. (Laughter)

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
But you adopt that combination,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
and then you start gaining weight like them.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Another more subtle possibility

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
is that they start gaining weight, and it changes your ideas

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
of what an acceptable body size is.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Here, what's spreading from person to person

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
is not a behavior, but rather a norm:

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
An idea is spreading.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Now, headline writers

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
had a field day with our studies.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
I think the headline in The New York Times was,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
"Are you packing it on?

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Blame your fat friends." (Laughter)

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
What was interesting to us is that the European headline writers

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
had a different take: They said,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
"Are your friends gaining weight? Perhaps you are to blame."

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
(Laughter)

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
And we thought this was a very interesting comment on America,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
and a kind of self-serving,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
"not my responsibility" kind of phenomenon.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Now, I want to be very clear: We do not think our work

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
should or could justify prejudice

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
against people of one or another body size at all.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Our next questions was:

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Could we actually visualize this spread?

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Was weight gain in one person actually spreading

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
to weight gain in another person?

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And this was complicated because

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
we needed to take into account the fact that the network structure,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
the architecture of the ties, was changing across time.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
In addition, because obesity is not a unicentric epidemic,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
there's not a Patient Zero of the obesity epidemic --

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
if we find that guy, there was a spread of obesity out from him --

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
it's a multicentric epidemic.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Lots of people are doing things at the same time.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
And I'm about to show you a 30 second video animation

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
that took me and James five years of our lives to do.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
So, again, every dot is a person.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Every tie between them is a relationship.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
We're going to put this into motion now,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
taking daily cuts through the network for about 30 years.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
The dot sizes are going to grow,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
you're going to see a sea of yellow take over.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
You're going to see people be born and die --

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
dots will appear and disappear --

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
ties will form and break, marriages and divorces,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
friendings and defriendings.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
A lot of complexity, a lot is happening

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
just in this 30-year period

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
that includes the obesity epidemic.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
And, by the end, you're going to see clusters

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
of obese and non-obese individuals

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
within the network.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Now, when looked at this,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
it changed the way I see things,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
because this thing, this network

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
that's changing across time,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
it has a memory, it moves,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
things flow within it,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
it has a kind of consistency --

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
people can die, but it doesn't die;

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
it still persists --

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
and it has a kind of resilience

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
that allows it to persist across time.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
And so, I came to see these kinds of social networks

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
as living things,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
as living things that we could put under a kind of microscope

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
to study and analyze and understand.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
And we used a variety of techniques to do this.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
And we started exploring all kinds of other phenomena.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
We looked at smoking and drinking behavior,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
and voting behavior,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
and divorce -- which can spread --

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
and altruism.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
And, eventually, we became interested in emotions.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Now, when we have emotions,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
we show them.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Why do we show our emotions?

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
I mean, there would be an advantage to experiencing

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
our emotions inside, you know, anger or happiness.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
But we don't just experience them, we show them.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
And not only do we show them, but others can read them.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
And, not only can they read them, but they copy them.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
There's emotional contagion

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
that takes place in human populations.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
And so this function of emotions

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
suggests that, in addition to any other purpose they serve,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
they're a kind of primitive form of communication.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
And that, in fact, if we really want to understand human emotions,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
we need to think about them in this way.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Now, we're accustomed to thinking about emotions in this way,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
in simple, sort of, brief periods of time.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
So, for example,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
I was giving this talk recently in New York City,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
and I said, "You know when you're on the subway

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
and the other person across the subway car

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
smiles at you,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
and you just instinctively smile back?"

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
And they looked at me and said, "We don't do that in New York City." (Laughter)

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
And I said, "Everywhere else in the world,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
that's normal human behavior."

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
And so there's a very instinctive way

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
in which we briefly transmit emotions to each other.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And, in fact, emotional contagion can be broader still.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Like we could have punctuated expressions of anger,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
as in riots.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
The question that we wanted to ask was:

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Could emotion spread,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
in a more sustained way than riots, across time

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
and involve large numbers of people,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
not just this pair of individuals smiling at each other in the subway car?

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Maybe there's a kind of below the surface, quiet riot

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
that animates us all the time.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Maybe there are emotional stampedes

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
that ripple through social networks.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Maybe, in fact, emotions have a collective existence,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
not just an individual existence.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
And this is one of the first images we made to study this phenomenon.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Again, a social network,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
but now we color the people yellow if they're happy

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
and blue if they're sad and green in between.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
And if you look at this image, you can right away see

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
clusters of happy and unhappy people,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
again, spreading to three degrees of separation.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And you might form the intuition

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
that the unhappy people

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
occupy a different structural location within the network.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
There's a middle and an edge to this network,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
and the unhappy people seem to be

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
located at the edges.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
So to invoke another metaphor,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
if you imagine social networks as a kind of

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
vast fabric of humanity --

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
I'm connected to you and you to her, on out endlessly into the distance --

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
this fabric is actually like

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
an old-fashioned American quilt,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
and it has patches on it: happy and unhappy patches.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
And whether you become happy or not

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
depends in part on whether you occupy a happy patch.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
(Laughter)

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
So, this work with emotions,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
which are so fundamental,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
then got us to thinking about: Maybe

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
the fundamental causes of human social networks

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
are somehow encoded in our genes.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Because human social networks, whenever they are mapped,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
always kind of look like this:

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
the picture of the network.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
But they never look like this.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Why do they not look like this?

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Why don't we form human social networks

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
that look like a regular lattice?

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Well, the striking patterns of human social networks,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
their ubiquity and their apparent purpose

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
beg questions about whether we evolved to have

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
human social networks in the first place,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
and whether we evolved to form networks

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
with a particular structure.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
And notice first of all -- so, to understand this, though,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
we need to dissect network structure a little bit first --

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
and notice that every person in this network

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
has exactly the same structural location as every other person.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
But that's not the case with real networks.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
So, for example, here is a real network of college students

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
at an elite northeastern university.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
And now I'm highlighting a few dots.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
If you look here at the dots,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
compare node B in the upper left

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
to node D in the far right;

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
B has four friends coming out from him

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
and D has six friends coming out from him.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
And so, those two individuals have different numbers of friends.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
That's very obvious, we all know that.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
But certain other aspects

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
of social network structure are not so obvious.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Compare node B in the upper left to node A in the lower left.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Now, those people both have four friends,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
but A's friends all know each other,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
and B's friends do not.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
So the friend of a friend of A's

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
is, back again, a friend of A's,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
whereas the friend of a friend of B's is not a friend of B's,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
but is farther away in the network.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
This is known as transitivity in networks.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
And, finally, compare nodes C and D:

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
C and D both have six friends.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
If you talk to them, and you said, "What is your social life like?"

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
they would say, "I've got six friends.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
That's my social experience."

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
But now we, with a bird's eye view looking at this network,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
can see that they occupy very different social worlds.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
And I can cultivate that intuition in you by just asking you:

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Who would you rather be

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
if a deadly germ was spreading through the network?

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Would you rather be C or D?

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
You'd rather be D, on the edge of the network.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
And now who would you rather be

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
if a juicy piece of gossip -- not about you --

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
was spreading through the network? (Laughter)

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Now, you would rather be C.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
So different structural locations

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
have different implications for your life.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
And, in fact, when we did some experiments looking at this,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
what we found is that 46 percent of the variation

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
in how many friends you have

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
is explained by your genes.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
And this is not surprising. We know that some people are born shy

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
and some are born gregarious. That's obvious.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
But we also found some non-obvious things.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
For instance, 47 percent in the variation

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
in whether your friends know each other

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
is attributable to your genes.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Whether your friends know each other

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
has not just to do with their genes, but with yours.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
And we think the reason for this is that some people

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
like to introduce their friends to each other -- you know who you are --

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
and others of you keep them apart and don't introduce your friends to each other.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
And so some people knit together the networks around them,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
creating a kind of dense web of ties

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
in which they're comfortably embedded.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
And finally, we even found that

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
30 percent of the variation

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
in whether or not people are in the middle or on the edge of the network

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
can also be attributed to their genes.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
So whether you find yourself in the middle or on the edge

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
is also partially heritable.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Now, what is the point of this?

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
How does this help us understand?

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
How does this help us

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
figure out some of the problems that are affecting us these days?

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Well, the argument I'd like to make is that networks have value.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
They are a kind of social capital.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
New properties emerge

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
because of our embeddedness in social networks,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
and these properties inhere

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
in the structure of the networks,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
not just in the individuals within them.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
So think about these two common objects.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
They're both made of carbon,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
and yet one of them has carbon atoms in it

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
that are arranged in one particular way -- on the left --

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
and you get graphite, which is soft and dark.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
But if you take the same carbon atoms

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
and interconnect them a different way,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
you get diamond, which is clear and hard.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
And those properties of softness and hardness and darkness and clearness

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
do not reside in the carbon atoms;

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
they reside in the interconnections between the carbon atoms,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
or at least arise because of the

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
interconnections between the carbon atoms.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
So, similarly, the pattern of connections among people

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
confers upon the groups of people

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
different properties.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
It is the ties between people

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
that makes the whole greater than the sum of its parts.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
And so it is not just what's happening to these people --

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
whether they're losing weight or gaining weight, or becoming rich or becoming poor,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
or becoming happy or not becoming happy -- that affects us;

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
it's also the actual architecture

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
of the ties around us.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Our experience of the world

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
depends on the actual structure

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
of the networks in which we're residing

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
and on all the kinds of things that ripple and flow

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
through the network.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Now, the reason, I think, that this is the case

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
is that human beings assemble themselves

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
and form a kind of superorganism.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Now, a superorganism is a collection of individuals

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
which show or evince behaviors or phenomena

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
that are not reducible to the study of individuals

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
and that must be understood by reference to,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
and by studying, the collective.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Like, for example, a hive of bees

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
that's finding a new nesting site,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
or a flock of birds that's evading a predator,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
or a flock of birds that's able to pool its wisdom

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
and navigate and find a tiny speck

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
of an island in the middle of the Pacific,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
or a pack of wolves that's able

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
to bring down larger prey.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Superorganisms have properties

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
that cannot be understood just by studying the individuals.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
I think understanding social networks

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
and how they form and operate

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
can help us understand not just health and emotions

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
but all kinds of other phenomena --

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
like crime, and warfare,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
and economic phenomena like bank runs

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
and market crashes

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
and the adoption of innovation

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
and the spread of product adoption.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Now, look at this.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
I think we form social networks

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
because the benefits of a connected life

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
outweigh the costs.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
If I was always violent towards you

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
or gave you misinformation

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
or made you sad or infected you with deadly germs,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
you would cut the ties to me,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
and the network would disintegrate.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
So the spread of good and valuable things

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
is required to sustain and nourish social networks.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Similarly, social networks are required

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
for the spread of good and valuable things,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
like love and kindness

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
and happiness and altruism

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
and ideas.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
I think, in fact, that if we realized

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
how valuable social networks are,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
we'd spend a lot more time nourishing them and sustaining them,

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
because I think social networks

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
are fundamentally related to goodness.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
And what I think the world needs now

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
is more connections.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Thank you.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
(Applause)
