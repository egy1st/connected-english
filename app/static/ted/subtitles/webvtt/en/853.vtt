WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
We invent.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
My company invents

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
all kinds of new technology

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
in lots of different areas.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And we do that for a couple of reasons.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We invent for fun --

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
invention is a lot of fun to do --

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and we also invent for profit.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
The two are related because

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
the profit actually takes long enough that if it isn't fun,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
you wouldn't have the time to do it.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So we do this

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
fun and profit-oriented inventing

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
for most of what we do,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
but we also have a program where we invent for humanity --

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
where we take some of our best inventors,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and we say, "Are there problems

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
where we have a good idea for solving a problem the world has?" --

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and to solve it in the way we try to solve problems,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
which is with dramatic, crazy,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
out-of-the-box solutions.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Bill Gates is one of those smartest guys of ours

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
that work on these problems

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and he also funds this work, so thank you.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So I'm going to briefly discuss

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
a couple of problems that we have

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and a couple of problems where

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
we've got some solutions underway.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Vaccination is one of the

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
key techniques in public health,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
a fantastic thing.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
But in the developing world a lot of vaccines

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
spoil before they're administered,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and that's because they need to be kept cold.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Almost all vaccines need to be kept at refrigerator temperatures.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
They go bad very quickly if you don't,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and if you don't have stable power grid, this doesn't happen,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
so kids die.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
It's not just the loss of the vaccine that matters;

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
it's the fact that those kids don't get vaccinated.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
This is one of the ways that

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
vaccines are carried:

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
These are Styrofoam chests. These are being carried by people,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
but they're also put on the backs of pickup trucks.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
We've got a different solution.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Now, one of these Styrofoam chests

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
will last for about four hours with ice in it.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And we thought, well, that's not really good enough.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
So we made this thing.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
This lasts six months with no power;

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
absolutely zero power,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
because it loses less

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
than a half a watt.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Now, this is our second generations prototype.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
The third generation prototype is, right now,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
in Uganda being tested.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Now, the reason we were able to come up with this

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
is two key ideas:

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
One is that this is similar to a cryogenic Dewar,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
something you'd keep liquid nitrogen or liquid helium in.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
They have incredible insulation,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
so let's put some incredible insulation here.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
The other idea is kind of interesting,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
which is, you can't reach inside anymore.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Because if you open it up and reach inside,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
you'd let the heat in, the game would be over.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
So the inside of this thing actually looks like a Coke machine.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
It vends out little individual vials.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
So a simple idea,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
which we hope is going to change the way vaccines are distributed

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
in Africa and around the world.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
We'll move on to malaria.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Malaria is one of the great public health problems.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Esther Duflo talked a little bit about this.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Two hundred million people a year.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Every 43 seconds a child in Africa dies;

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
27 will die during my talk.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And there's no way for us here in this country

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
to grasp really what that means to the people involved.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Another comment of Esther's

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
was that we react when there's

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
a tragedy like Haiti,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
but that tragedy is ongoing.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
So what can we do about it?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Well, there are a lot of things people have tried

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
for many years for solving malaria.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
You can spray; the problem is there are environmental issues.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
You can try to treat people and create awareness.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
That's great, except the places that have malaria really bad,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
they don't have health care systems.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
A vaccine would be a terrific thing,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
only they don't work yet.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
People have tried for a long time. There are a couple of interesting candidates.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
It's a very difficult thing to make a vaccine for.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
You can distribute bed nets,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and bed nets are very effective if you use them.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
You don't always use them for that. People fish with them.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
They don't always get to everyone.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
And bed nets

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
have an effect on the epidemic,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
but you're never going to make it extinct with bed nets.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Now, malaria is

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
an incredibly complicated disease.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
We could spend hours going over this.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
It's got this sort of soap opera-like lifestyle;

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
they have sex, they burrow into your liver,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
they tunnel into your blood cells ...

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
it's an incredibly complicated disease,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
but that's actually one of the things we find interesting about it

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
and why we work on malaria:

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
There's a lot of potential ways in.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
One of those ways might be better diagnosis.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
So we hope this year

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
to prototype each of these devices.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
One does an automatic malaria diagnosis

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
in the same way that a diabetic's glucose meter works:

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
You take a drop of blood,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
you put it in there and it automatically tells you.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Today, you need to do a complicated laboratory procedure,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
create a bunch of microscope slides

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
and have a trained person examine it.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
The other thing is, you know,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
it would be even better if you didn't have to draw the blood.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And if you look through the eye,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
or you look at the vessels on the white of the eye,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
in fact, you may be able to do this

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
directly, without drawing any blood at all,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
or through your nail beds.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Because if you actually look through your fingernails, you can see blood vessels,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
and once you see blood vessels, we think we can see the malaria.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
We can see it because of this molecule

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
called hemozoin.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
It's produced by the malaria parasite

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
and it's a very interesting crystalline substance.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Interesting, anyway, if you're a solid-state physicist.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
There's a lot of cool stuff we can do with it.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
This is our femtosecond laser lab.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
So this creates pulses of light

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
that last a femtosecond.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
That's really, really, really short.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
This is a pulse of light that's

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
only about one wavelength of light long,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
so it's a whole bunch of photons

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
all coming and hitting simultaneously.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
It creates a very high peak power

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
and it lets you do all kinds of interesting things;

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
in particular, it lets you find hemozoin.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
So here's an image of red blood cells,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
and now we can actually map

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
where the hemozoin and where the malaria parasites are

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
inside those red blood cells.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
And using both this technique

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
and other optical techniques,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
we think we can make those diagnostics.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
We also have another hemozoin-oriented

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
therapy for malaria:

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
a way, in acute cases, to actually

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
take the malaria parasite and filter it out of the blood system.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Sort of like doing dialysis,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
but for relieving the parasite load.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
This is our thousand-core supercomputer.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
We're kind of software guys,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and so nearly any problem that you pose,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
we like to try to solve with some software.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
One of the problems that you have if you're trying to eradicate malaria

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
or reduce it

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
is you don't know what's the most effective thing to do.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Okay, we heard about bed nets earlier.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
You spend a certain amount per bed net.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Or you could spray.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
You can give drug administration.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
There's all these different interventions

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
but they have different kinds of effectiveness.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
How can you tell?

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
So we've created, using our supercomputer,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
the world's best computer model of malaria,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
which we'll show you now.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
We picked Madagascar.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
We have every road,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
every village,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
every, almost, square inch of Madagascar.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
We have all of the precipitation data

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
and the temperature data.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
That's very important because the humidity and precipitation

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
tell you whether you've got

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
standing pools of water for the mosquitoes to breed.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
So that sets the stage on which you do this.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
You then have to introduce the mosquitoes,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
and you have to model that

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
and how they come and go.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Ultimately, it gives you this.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
This is malaria spreading

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
across Madagascar.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And this is this latter part of the rainy season.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
We're going to the dry season now.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
It nearly goes away in the dry season,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
because there's no place for the mosquitoes to breed.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And then, of course, the next year it comes roaring back.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
By doing these kinds of simulations,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
we want to eradicate or control malaria

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
thousands of times in software

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
before we actually have to do it in real life;

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
to be able to simulate both the economic trade-offs --

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
how many bed nets versus how much spraying? --

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
or the social trade-offs --

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
what happens if unrest breaks out?

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
We also try to study our foe.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
This is a high-speed camera view

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
of a mosquito.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
And, in a moment,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
we're going to see a view of the airflow.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Here, we're trying to visualize the airflow

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
around the wings of the mosquito

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
with little particles we're illuminating with a laser.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
By understanding how mosquitoes fly,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
we hope to understand how to make them not fly.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Now, one of the ways you can make them not fly

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
is with DDT.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
This is a real ad.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
This is one of those things you just can't make up.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Once upon a time, this was the primary technique,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
and, in fact, many countries got rid of malaria through DDT.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
The United States did.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
In 1935, there were 150,000 cases a year

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
of malaria in the United States,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
but DDT and a massive public health effort

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
managed to squelch it.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
So we thought,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
"Well, we've done all these things that are focused on the Plasmodium,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
the parasite involved.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
What can we do to the mosquito?

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Well, let's try to kill it with consumer electronics."

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Now, that sounds silly,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
but each of these devices

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
has something interesting in it that maybe you could use.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Your Blu-ray player has

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
a very cheap blue laser.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Your laser printer has a mirror galvanometer

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
that's used to steer a laser beam very accurately;

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
that's what makes those little dots on the page.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
And, of course, there's signal processing

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
and digital cameras.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
So what if we could put all that together

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
to shoot them out of the sky with lasers?

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
(Laughter)

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
(Applause)

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Now, in our company, this is what we call

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
"the pinky-suck moment."

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
(Laughter)

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
What if we could do that?

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Now, just suspend disbelief for a moment,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
and let's think of what could happen

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
if we could do that.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Well, we could protect very high-value targets like clinics.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Clinics are full of people that have malaria.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
They're sick, and so they're less able to defend themselves from the mosquitoes.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
You really want to protect them.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Of course, if you do that,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
you could also protect your backyard.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
And farmers could protect their crops

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
that they want to sell to Whole Foods

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
because our photons

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
are 100 percent organic. (Laughter)

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
They're completely natural.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Now, it actually gets better than this.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
You could, if you're really smart,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
you could shine a nonlethal laser on the bug

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
before you zap it,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
and you could listen to the wing beat frequency

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
and you could measure the size.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
And then you could decide:

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
"Is this an insect I want to kill,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
or an insect I don't want to kill?"

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Moore's law made computing cheap;

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
so cheap we can weigh

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
the life of an individual insect

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
and decide thumbs up

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
or thumbs down. (Laughter)

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Now, it turns out we only kill the female mosquitoes.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
They're the only ones that are dangerous.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Mosquitoes only drink blood

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
to lay eggs.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Mosquitoes actually live ... their day-to-day nutrition

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
comes from nectar, from flowers --

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
in fact, in the lab, we feed ours raisins --

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
but the female needs the blood meal.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
So, this sounds really crazy, right?

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Would you like to see it?

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Audience: Yeah!

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Nathan Myhrvold: Okay, so our legal department prepared a disclaimer,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
and here it is.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
(Laughter)

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Now, after thinking about this a little bit

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
we thought, you know, it probably would be simpler

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
to do this with a nonlethal laser.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
So, Eric Johanson, who built the device,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
actually, with parts from eBay;

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
and Pablos Holman over here,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
he's got mosquitoes in the tank.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
We have the device over here.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
And we're going to show you,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
instead of the kill laser,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
which will be a very brief, instantaneous pulse,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
we're going to have a green laser pointer

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
that's going to stay on the mosquito for, actually, quite a long period of time;

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
otherwise, you can't see it very well.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Take it away Eric.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Eric Johanson: What we have here

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
is a tank on the other side of the stage.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
And we have ... this computer screen

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
can actually see the mosquitoes as they fly around.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
And Pablos, if he stirs up our mosquitoes a little bit

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
we can see them flying around.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Now, that's a fairly straightforward image processing routine,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
and let me show you how it works.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Here you can see that the insects are being tracked

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
as they're flying around,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
which is kind of fun.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Next we can actually light them up with a laser. (Laughter)

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Now, this is a low powered laser,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
and we can actually pick up a wing-beat frequency.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
So you may be able to hear some mosquitoes flying around.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
NM: That's a mosquito wing beat you're hearing.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
EJ: Finally, let's see what this looks like.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
There you can see mosquitoes as they fly around, being lit up.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
This is slowed way down

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
so that you have an opportunity to see what's happening.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Here we have it running at high-speed mode.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
So this system that was built for TED is here to illustrate

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
that it is technically possible to actually deploy a system like this,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
and we're looking very hard at how to make it

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
highly cost-effective to use in places like Africa and other parts of the world.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.000
(Applause)

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
NM: So it wouldn't be any fun to show you that

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
without showing you what actually happens when we hit 'em.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
(Laughter)

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
(Laughter)

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
This is very satisfying.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
(Laughter)

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
This is one of the first ones we did.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
The energy's a little bit high here.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
(Laughter)

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
We'll loop around here in just a second, and you'll see another one.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Here's another one. Bang.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
An interesting thing is, we kill them all the time;

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
we've never actually gotten the wings to shut off in midair.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
The wing motor is very resilient.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
I mean, here we're blowing wings off

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
but the wing motor keeps all the way down.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
So, that's what I have. Thanks very much.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:48.000
(Applause)
