00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm going to tell you two things today:

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
One is what we have lost,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and two, a way to bring it back.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And let me start with this.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This is my baseline:

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
This is the Mediterranean coast

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
with no fish, bare rock

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and lots of sea urchins that like to eat the algae.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Something like this is what I first saw

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
when I jumped in the water for the first time

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
in the Mediterranean coast off Spain.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Now, if an alien came to earth --

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
let's call him Joe --

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
what would Joe see?

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
If Joe jumped in a coral reef,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
there are many things the alien could see.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Very unlikely, Joe would jump

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
on a pristine coral reef,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
a virgin coral reef with lots of coral, sharks, crocodiles,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
manatees, groupers,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
turtles, etc.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So, probably, what Joe would see

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
would be in this part, in the greenish part of the picture.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Here we have the extreme with dead corals,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
microbial soup and jellyfish.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And where the diver is,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
this is probably where most of the reefs of the world are now,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
with very few corals, algae overgrowing the corals,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
lots of bacteria,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and where the large animals are gone.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And this is what most marine scientists have seen too.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
This is their baseline. This is what they think is natural

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
because we started modern science

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
with scuba diving long after

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
we started degrading marine ecosystems.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
So I'm going to get us all on a time machine,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and we're going to the left; we're going to go back to the past

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
to see what the ocean was like.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And let's start with this time machine, the Line Islands,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
where we have conducted a series

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
of National Geographic expeditions.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
This sea is an archipelago belonging to Kiribati

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
that spans across the equator

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and it has several uninhabited,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
unfished, pristine islands

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and a few inhabited islands.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So let's start with the first one: Christmas Island, over 5,000 people.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Most of the reefs are dead,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
most of the corals are dead -- overgrown by algae --

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and most of the fish are smaller than

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
the pencils we use to count them.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
We did 250 hours of diving here

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
in 2005.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
We didn't see a single shark.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
This is the place that Captain Cook discovered in 1777

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and he described a huge abundance of sharks

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
biting the rudders and the oars of their small boats

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
while they were going ashore.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Let's move the dial a little bit to the past.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Fanning Island, 2,500 people.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
The corals are doing better here. Lots of small fish.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
This is what many divers would consider paradise.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
This is where you can see most

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And many people think this is really, really beautiful,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
if this is your baseline.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
If we go back to a place

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
like Palmyra Atoll,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
where I was with Jeremy Jackson a few years ago,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
the corals are doing better and there are sharks.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
You can see sharks in every single dive.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And this is something that is very unusual in today's coral reefs.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
But then, if we shift the dial

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
200, 500 years back,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
then we get to the places where the corals

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
are absolutely healthy and gorgeous,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
forming spectacular structures,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
and where the predators

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
are the most conspicuous thing,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
where you see between 25 and 50 sharks per dive.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
What have we learned from these places?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
This is what we thought was natural.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
This is what we call the biomass pyramid.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
If we get all of the fish of a coral reef together and weigh them,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
this is what we would expect.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Most of the biomass is low on the food chain, the herbivores,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
the parrotfish, the surgeonfish that eat the algae.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Then the plankton feeders, these little damselfish,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
the little animals floating in the water.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
And then we have a lower biomass of carnivores,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and a lower biomass of top head,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
or the sharks, the large snappers, the large groupers.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
But this is a consequence.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
This view of the world is a consequence

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
of having studied degraded reefs.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
When we went to pristine reefs,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
we realized that the natural world

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
was upside down;

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
this pyramid was inverted.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
The top head does account for most of the biomass,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
in some places up to 85 percent,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
like Kingman Reef, which is now protected.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
The good news is that, in addition to having more predators,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
there's more of everything.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
The size of these boxes is bigger.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
We have more sharks, more biomass of snappers,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
more biomass of herbivores, too,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
like these parrot fish that are like marine goats.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
They clean the reef; everything that grows enough to be seen,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
they eat, and they keep the reef clean

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and allow the corals to replenish.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Not only do these places --

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
these ancient, pristine places -- have lots of fish,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
but they also have other important components

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
of the ecosystem like the giant clams;

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
pavements of giant clams in the lagoons,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
up to 20, 25 per square meter.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
These have disappeared from every inhabited reef in the world,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
and they filter the water;

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
they keep the water clean from

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
microbes and pathogens.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
But still, now we have global warming.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
If we don't have fishing because these reefs are protected by law

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
or their remoteness, this is great.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
But the water gets warmer for too long

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
and the corals die.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
So how are these fish,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
these predators going to help?

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Well, what we have seen is that

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
in this particular area

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
during El Nino, year '97, '98,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
the water was too warm for too long,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
and many corals bleached

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
and many died.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
In Christmas, where the food web is really trimmed down,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
where the large animals are gone,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
the corals have not recovered.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
In Fanning Island, the corals are not recovered.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
But you see here

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
a big table coral that died and collapsed.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And the fish have grazed the algae,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
so the turf of algae is a little lower.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Then you go to Palmyra Atoll

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
that has more biomass of herbivores,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
and the dead corals are clean,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
and the corals are coming back.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
And when you go to the pristine side,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
did this ever bleach?

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
These places bleached too, but they recovered faster.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
The more intact, the more complete,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
[and] the more complex your food web,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
the higher the resilience, [and] the more likely

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
that the system is going to recover

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
from the short-term impacts of warming events.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And that's good news, so we need to recover that structure.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
We need to make sure that all of the pieces of the ecosystem are there

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
so the ecosystem can adapt

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
to the effects of global warming.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
So if we have to reset the baseline,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
if we have to push the ecosystem back to the left,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
how can we do it?

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Well, there are several ways.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
One very clear way is the marine protected areas,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
especially no-take reserves

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
that we set aside

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
to allow for the recovery for marine life.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
And let me go back to that image

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
of the Mediterranean.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
This was my baseline. This is what I saw when I was a kid.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And at the same time I was watching

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Jacques Cousteau's shows on TV,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
with all this richness and abundance and diversity.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
And I thought that this richness

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
belonged to tropical seas,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
and that the Mediterranean was a naturally poor sea.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
But, little did I know,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
until I jumped for the first time in a marine reserve.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And this is what I saw, lots of fish.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
After a few years, between five and seven years,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
fish come back, they eat the urchins,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
and then the algae grow again.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
So you have this little algal forest,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
and in the size of a laptop

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
you can find more than 100 species of algae,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
mostly microscopic fit

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
hundreds of species of little animals

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
that then feed the fish,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
so that the system recovers.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
And this particular place, the Medes Islands Marine Reserve,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
is only 94 hectares,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
and it brings 6 million euros to the local economy,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
20 times more than fishing,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
and it represents 88 percent

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
of all the tourist revenue.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
So these places not only help the ecosystem

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
but also help the people

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
who can benefit from the ecosystem.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
So let me just give you a summary

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
of what no-take reserves do.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
These places, when we protect them,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
if we compare them to unprotected areas nearby, this is what happens.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
The number of species increases 21 percent;

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
so if you have 1,000 species

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
you would expect 200 more in a marine reserve.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
This is very substantial.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
The size of organisms increases a third,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
so your fish are now this big.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
The abundance, how many fish you have per square meter,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
increases almost 170 percent.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And the biomass -- this is the most spectacular change --

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
4.5 times greater biomass

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
on average, just after five to seven years.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
In some places up to 10 times

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
larger biomass inside the reserves.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
So we have all these things

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
inside the reserve that grow, and what do they do?

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
They reproduce. That's population biology 101.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
If you don't kill the fish, they take a longer time to die,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
they grow larger and they reproduce a lot.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
And same thing for invertebrates. This is the example.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
These are egg cases

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
laid by a snail off the coast of Chile,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
and this is how many eggs they lay on the bottom.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Outside the reserve,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
you cannot even detect this.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
One point three million eggs per square meter

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
inside the marine reserve where these snails are very abundant.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
So these organisms reproduce,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
the little larvae juveniles spill over,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
they all spill over,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
and then people can benefit from them outside too.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
This is in the Bahamas: Nassau grouper.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Huge abundance of groupers inside the reserve,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
and the closer you get to the reserve,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
the more fish you have.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
So the fishermen are catching more.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
You can see where the limits of the reserve are

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
because you see the boats lined up.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
So there is spill over;

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
there are benefits beyond the boundaries of these reserves

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
that help people around them,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
while at the same time

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
the reserve is protecting

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
the entire habitat. It is building resilience.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
So what we have now --

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
or a world without reserves --

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
is like a debit account

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
where we withdraw all the time

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
and we never make any deposit.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Reserves are like savings accounts.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
We have this principal that we don't touch;

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
that produces returns,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
social, economic and ecological.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
And if we think about the increase of biomass inside the reserves,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
this is like compound interest.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Two examples, again,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
of how these reserves can benefit people.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
This is how much fishermen get

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
everyday in Kenya, fishing

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
over a series of years,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
in a place where

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
there is no protection; it's a free-for-all.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Once the most degrading fishing gear,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
seine nets, were removed,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
the fishermen were catching more.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
If you fish less, you're actually catching more.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
But if we add the no-take reserve on top of that,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
the fishermen are still making more money

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
by fishing less around an area that is protected.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Another example:

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Nassau groupers in Belize in the Mesoamerican Reef.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
This is grouper sex,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
and the groupers aggregate around the full moons

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
of December and January for a week.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
They used to aggregate up to the

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
tens of thousands, 30,000 groupers about this big

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
in one hectare, in one aggregation.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Fishermen knew about these things; they caught them, and they depleted them.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
When I went there for the first time in 2000,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
there were only 3,000 groupers left.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
And the fishermen were authorized to catch 30 percent

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
of the entire spawning population every year.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
So we did a simple analysis,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
and it doesn't take rocket science

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
to figure out that, if you take 30 percent every year,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
your fishery is going to collapse very quickly.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And with the fishery, the entire reproductive ability

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
of the species goes extinct.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
It happened in many places around the Caribbean.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
And they would make 4,000 dollars per year,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
total, for the entire fishery,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
several fishing boats.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Now, if you do an economic analysis

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
and project what would happen

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
if the fish were not cut,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
if we brought just 20 divers

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
one month per year,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
the revenue would be more than 20 times higher

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
and that would be sustainable over time.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
So how much of this do we have?

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
If this is so good, if this is such a no-brainer, how much of this do we have?

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
And you already heard that

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
less than one percent of the ocean's protected.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
We're getting closer to one percent now,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
thanks to the protections of the Chagos Archipelago,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
and only a fraction of this is fully protected from fishing.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Scientific studies recommend that at least 20 percent

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
of the ocean should be protected.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
The estimated range is between 20 and 50 percent

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
for a series of goals of biodiversity

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
and fishery enhancement and resilience.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Now, is this possible? People would ask: How much would that cost?

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Well, let's think about

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
how much we are paying now

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
to subsidize fishing:

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
35 billion dollars per year.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Many of these subsidies go to destructive fishing practices.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Well, there are a couple estimates

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
of how much it would cost to create

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
a network of protected areas

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
covering 20 percent of the ocean

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
that would be only a fraction

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
of what we are now paying;

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
the government hands out to a fishery

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
that is collapsing.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
People are losing their jobs because the fisheries are collapsing.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
A creation of a network of reserves

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
would provide direct employment for more than a million people

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
plus all the secondary jobs and all the secondary benefits.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
So how can we do that?

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
If it's so clear that these savings accounts

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
are good for the environment and for people,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
why don't we have 20, 50 percent of the ocean?

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
And how can we reach that goal?

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Well, there are two ways of getting there.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
The trivial solution is to create really large protected areas

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
like the Chagos Archipelago.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
The problem is that we can create these large reserves

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
only in places where there are no people, where there is no social conflict,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
where the political cost is really low

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
and the economic cost is also low.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
And a few of us, a few organizations in this room and elsewhere

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
are working on this.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
But what about the rest of the coast of the world,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
where people live and make a living out of fishing?

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Well, there are three main reasons why

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
we don't have tens of thousands of small reserves:

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
The first one is that people have no idea

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
what marine reserves do,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
and fishermen tend to be really, really defensive

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
when it comes to regulating or closing

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
an area, even if it's small.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Second, the governance is not right

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
because most coastal communities around the world

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
don't have the authority

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
to monitor the resources to create the reserve and enforce it.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
It's a top down hierarchical structure

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
where people wait for

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
government agents to come

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
and this is not effective. And the government doesn't have enough resources.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Which takes us to the third reason,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
why we don't have many more reserves,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
is that the funding models have been wrong.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
NGOs and governments

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
spend a lot of time and energy and resources

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
in a few small areas, usually.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
So marine conservation and coastal protection

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
has become a sink for government or philanthropic money,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
and this is not sustainable.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
So the solutions are just

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
fixing these three issues.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
First, we need to develop a global awareness campaign

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
to inspire local communities and governments

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
to create no-take reserves

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
that are better than what we have now.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
It's the savings accounts

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
versus the debit accounts with no deposits.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Second, we need to redesign our governance

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
so conservation efforts can be decentralized,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
so conservation efforts don't depend on

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
work from NGOs

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
or from government agencies

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
and can be created by the local communities,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
like it happens in the Philippines and a few other places.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
And third, and very important,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
we need to develop new business models.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
The philanthropy sink as the only way to create reserves

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
is not sustainable.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
We really need to develop models, business models,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
where coastal conservation

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
is an investment,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
because we already know

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
that these marine reserves provide

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
social, ecological and economic benefits.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
And I'd like to finish with one thought,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
which is that no one

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
organization alone

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
is going to save the ocean.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
There has been a lot of competition in the past,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
and we need to develop

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
a new model of partnership,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
truly collaborative,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
where we are looking for complementing,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
not substituting.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
The stakes are just too high

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
to continue the way we are going.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
So let's do that. Thank you very much.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:23.000
(Applause)

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
Chris Anderson: Thank you Enric.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Enric Sala: Thank you.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
CA: That was a masterful job

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
of pulling things together.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
First of all, your pyramid, your inverted pyramid,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
showing 85 percent biomass in the predators,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
that seems impossible.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
How could 85 percent

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
survive on 15 percent?

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
ES: Well, imagine that you have two gears

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
of a watch, a big one and a small one.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
The big one is moving very slowly, and the small one is moving fast.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
That's basically it.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
The animals at the lower parts of the food chain,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
they reproduce very fast; they grow really fast; they produce millions of eggs.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Up there, you have sharks and large fish that live 25, 30 years.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
They reproduce very slowly; they have a slow metabolism;

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
and, basically, they just maintain their biomass.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
So, basically, the production surplus of these guys down there

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
is enough to maintain this biomass

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
that is not moving.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
They are like capacitors of the system.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
CA: That's very fascinating.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
So, really, our picture of a food pyramid

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
is just -- we have to change that completely.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
ES: At least in the seas.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
What we found in coral reefs is that the inverted pyramid

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
is the equivalent of the Serengeti,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
with five lions per wildebeest.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
And on land, this cannot work.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
But at least on coral reefs are systems

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
where there is a bottom component with structure.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
We think this is universal.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
But we have started studying pristine reefs

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
only very recently.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
CA: So the numbers you presented really are astonishing.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
You're saying we're spending 35 billion dollars

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
now on subsidies.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
It would only cost 16 billion to set up

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
20 percent of the ocean as

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
marine protected areas

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
that actually give new living choices

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
to the fishermen as well.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
If the world was a smarter place,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
we could solve this problem for negative 19 billion dollars.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
We've got 19 billion to spend on health care or something.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
ES: And then we have the under-performance of fisheries

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
that is 50 billion dollars.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
So again, one of the big solutions is

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
have the World Trade Organization shifting the subsidies

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
to sustainable practices.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
CA: Okay, so there's a lot of examples that I'm hearing out there

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
about ending this subsidies madness.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
So thank you for those numbers.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
The last one's a personal question.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
A lot of the experience of people here

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
who've been in the oceans for a long time

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000
has just been seeing this degradation, the places they saw that were beautiful

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
getting worse, depressing.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Talk to me about the feeling that you must have experienced

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
of going to these pristine areas

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
and seeing things coming back.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
ES: It is a spiritual experience.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
We go there to try to understand the ecosystems,

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
to try to measure or count fish and sharks

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
and see how these places are different from the places we know.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
But the best feeling

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
is this biophilia that E.O. Wilson talks about,

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
where humans have this sense of awe and wonder

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
in front of untamed nature, of raw nature.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
And there, only there,

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
you really feel that you are part of a larger thing

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
or of a larger global ecosystem.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
And if it were not for these places that show hope,

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
I don't think I could continue doing this job.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
It would be just too depressing.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
CA: Well, Enric, thank you so much for sharing

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
some of that spiritual experience with us all. Thank you.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
ES: Thank you very much.
