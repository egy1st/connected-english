00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Can I ask you to please recall a time

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
when you really loved something --

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
a movie, an album, a song or a book --

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and you recommended it wholeheartedly

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
to someone you also really liked,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and you anticipated that reaction, you waited for it,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and it came back, and the person hated it?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So, by way of introduction,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
that is the exact same state

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
in which I spent every working day of the last six years. (Laughter)

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I teach high school math.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I sell a product to a market

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
that doesn't want it, but is forced by law to buy it.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I mean, it's just a losing proposition.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
So there's a useful stereotype about students that I see,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
a useful stereotype about you all.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I could give you guys

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
an algebra-two final exam,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and I would expect no higher

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
than a 25 percent pass rate.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And both of these facts say less about you or my students

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
than they do about what we call math education

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
in the U.S. today.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
To start with, I'd like to break math down into two categories.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
One is computation; this is the stuff you've forgotten.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
For example, factoring quadratics with

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
leading coefficients greater than one.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
This stuff is also really easy to relearn,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
provided you have a really strong grounding

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
in reasoning. Math reasoning --

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
we'll call it the application

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
of math processes to the world around us --

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
this is hard to teach.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
This is what we would love students to retain,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
even if they don't go into mathematical fields.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
This is also something that, the way we teach it in the U.S.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
all but ensures they won't retain it.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
So, I'd like to talk about why that is,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
why that's such a calamity for society, what we can do about it

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and, to close with, why this is an amazing time

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
to be a math teacher.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
So first, five symptoms

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
that you're doing math reasoning wrong

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
in your classroom.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
One is a lack of initiative; your students don't self-start.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
You finish your lecture block

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and immediately you have five hands going up

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
asking you to re-explain the entire thing at their desks.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Students lack perseverance.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
They lack retention; you find yourself

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
re-explaining concepts three months later, wholesale.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
There's an aversion to word problems,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
which describes 99 percent of my students.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And then the other one percent

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
is eagerly looking for the formula

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
to apply in that situation.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
This is really destructive.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
David Milch, creator of "Deadwood" and other amazing TV shows,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
has a really good description for this.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
He swore off creating

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
contemporary drama,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
shows set in the present day,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
because he saw that when people fill their mind

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
with four hours a day of, for example, "Two and a Half Men," no disrespect,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
it shapes the neural pathways, he said,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
in such a way that they expect simple problems.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
He called it, "an impatience with irresolution."

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
You're impatient with things that don't resolve quickly.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
You expect sitcom-sized problems that wrap up in 22 minutes,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
three commercial breaks and a laugh track.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And I'll put it to all of you,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
what you already know, that no problem worth solving is that simple.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
I am very concerned about this

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
because I'm going to retire in a world that my students will run.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I'm doing bad things

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
to my own future and well-being

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
when I teach this way.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I'm here to tell you that the way our textbooks -- particularly

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
mass-adopted textbooks -- teach math reasoning

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and patient problem solving,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
it's functionally equivalent to turning on "Two and a Half Men" and calling it a day.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
(Laughter)

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
In all seriousness. Here's an example from a physics textbook.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
It applies equally to math.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Notice, first of all here,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
that you have exactly three pieces of information there,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
each of which will figure into a formula

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
somewhere, eventually,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
which the student will then compute.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
I believe in real life.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And ask yourself, what problem have you solved, ever,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
that was worth solving

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
where you knew all of the given information in advance;

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
where you didn't have a surplus of information and you had to filter it out,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
or you didn't have sufficient information

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
and had to go find some.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
I'm sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And the textbook, I think, knows how it's hamstringing students

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
because, watch this, this is the practice problem set.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
When it comes time to do the actual problem set,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
we have problems like this right here

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
where we're just swapping out numbers and tweaking the context a little bit.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And if the student still doesn't recognize the stamp this was molded from,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
it helpfully explains to you

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
what sample problem you can return to to find the formula.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
You could literally, I mean this,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
pass this particular unit without knowing any physics,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
just knowing how to decode a textbook. That's a shame.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
So I can diagnose the problem a little more specifically in math.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Here's a really cool problem. I like this.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
It's about defining steepness and slope

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
using a ski lift.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
But what you have here is actually four separate layers,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
and I'm curious which of you can see the four separate layers

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
and, particularly, how when they're compressed together

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and presented to the student all at once,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
how that creates this impatient problem solving.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
I'll define them here: You have the visual.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
You also have the mathematical structure,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
talking about grids, measurements, labels,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
points, axes, that sort of thing.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
You have substeps, which all lead to what we really want to talk about:

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
which section is the steepest.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
So I hope you can see.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
I really hope you can see how what we're doing here

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
is taking a compelling question, a compelling answer,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
but we're paving a smooth, straight path

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
from one to the other

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
and congratulating our students for how well

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
they can step over the small cracks in the way.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
That's all we're doing here.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
So I want to put to you that if we can separate these in a different way

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
and build them up with students,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
we can have everything we're looking for in terms of patient problem solving.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
So right here I start with the visual,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
and I immediately ask the question:

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Which section is the steepest?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
And this starts conversation

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
because the visual is created in such a way where you can defend two answers.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
So you get people arguing against each other,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
friend versus friend,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
in pairs, journaling, whatever.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And then eventually we realize

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
it's getting annoying to talk about

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
the skier in the lower left-hand side of the screen

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
or the skier just above the mid line.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
And we realize how great would it be

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
if we just had some A, B, C and D labels

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
to talk about them more easily.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
And then as we start to define what does steepness mean,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
we realize it would be nice to have some measurements

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
to really narrow it down, specifically what that means.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
And then and only then,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
we throw down that mathematical structure.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
The math serves the conversation,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
the conversation doesn't serve the math.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
And at that point, I'll put it to you that nine out of 10 classes

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
are good to go on the whole slope, steepness thing.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
But if you need to,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
your students can then develop those substeps together.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Do you guys see how this, right here, compared to that --

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
which one creates that patient problem solving, that math reasoning?

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
It's been obvious in my practice, to me.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
And I'll yield the floor here for a second to Einstein,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
who, I believe, has paid his dues.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
He talked about the formulation of a problem being so incredibly important,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
and yet in my practice, in the U.S. here,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
we just give problems to students;

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
we don't involve them in the formulation of the problem.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
So 90 percent of what I do

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
with my five hours of prep time per week

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
is to take fairly compelling elements

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
of problems like this from my textbook

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
and rebuild them in a way that supports math reasoning and patient problem solving.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
And here's how it works.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
I like this question. It's about a water tank.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
The question is: How long will it take you to fill it up?

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
First things first, we eliminate all the substeps.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Students have to develop those,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
they have to formulate those.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
And then notice that all the information written on there is stuff you'll need.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
None of it's a distractor, so we lose that.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Students need to decide, "All right, well,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
does the height matter? Does the side of it matter?

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Does the color of the valve matter? What matters here?"

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Such an underrepresented question in math curriculum.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
So now we have a water tank.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
How long will it take you to fill it up? And that's it.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
And because this is the 21st century

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
not in terms of line art or clip art

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
that you so often see in textbooks,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
we go out and we take a picture of it.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
So now we have the real deal.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
How long will it take it to fill it up?

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
And then even better is we take a video,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
a video of someone filling it up.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
And it's filling up slowly, agonizingly slowly.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
It's tedious.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Students are looking at their watches, rolling their eyes,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
and they're all wondering at some point or another,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
"Man, how long is it going to take to fill up?"

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
(Laughter)

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
That's how you know you've baited the hook, right?

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
And that question, off this right here, is really fun for me

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
because, like the intro,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
I teach kids -- because of my inexperience --

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
I teach the kids that are the most remedial, all right?

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
And I've got kids who will not join a conversation about math

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
because someone else has the formula;

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
someone else knows how to work the formula better than me,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
so I won't talk about it.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
But here, every student is on a level playing field of intuition.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Everyone's filled something up with water before,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
so I get kids answering the question, "How long will it take?"

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
I've got kids who are mathematically and conversationally intimidated

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
joining the conversation.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
We put names on the board, attach them to guesses,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
and kids have bought in here.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
And then we follow the process I've described.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
And the best part here, or one of the better parts

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
is that we don't get our answer from the answer key

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
in the back of the teacher's edition.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
We, instead, just watch the end of the movie.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
(Laughter)

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
And that's terrifying,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
because the theoretical models that always work out

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
in the answer key in the back of a teacher's edition,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
that's great, but

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
it's scary to talk about sources of error

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
when the theoretical does not match up with the practical.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
But those conversations have been so valuable,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
among the most valuable.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
So I'm here to report some really fun games

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
with students who come pre-installed

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
with these viruses day one of the class.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
These are the kids who now, one semester in,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
I can put something on the board,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
totally new, totally foreign,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
and they'll have a conversation about it for three or four minutes more

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
than they would have at the start of the year,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
which is just so fun.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
We're no longer averse to word problems,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
because we've redefined what a word problem is.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
We're no longer intimidated by math,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
because we're slowly redefining what math is.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
This has been a lot of fun.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
I encourage math teachers I talk to to use multimedia,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
because it brings the real world into your classroom

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
in high resolution and full color;

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
to encourage student intuition for that level playing field;

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
to ask the shortest question you possibly can

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
and let those more specific questions come out in conversation;

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
to let students build the problem,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
because Einstein said so;

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
and to finally, in total, just be less helpful,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
because the textbook is helping you in all the wrong ways:

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
It's buying you out of your obligation,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
for patient problem solving and math reasoning, to be less helpful.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
And why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher right now

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
is because we have the tools to create

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
this high-quality curriculum in our front pocket.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
It's ubiquitous and fairly cheap,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
and the tools to distribute it

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
freely under open licenses

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
has also never been cheaper or more ubiquitous.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
I put a video series on my blog not so long ago

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
and it got 6,000 views in two weeks.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
I get emails still from teachers in countries I've never visited

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
saying, "Wow, yeah. We had a good conversation about that.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Oh, and by the way, here's how I made your stuff better,"

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
which, wow.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
I put this problem on my blog recently:

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
In a grocery store, which line do you get into,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
the one that has one cart and 19 items

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
or the line with four carts and three, five, two and one items.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
And the linear modeling involved in that was some good stuff for my classroom,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
but it eventually got me on "Good Morning America" a few weeks later,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
which is just bizarre, right?

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
And from all of this, I can only conclude

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
that people, not just students,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
are really hungry for this.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Math makes sense of the world.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Math is the vocabulary

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
for your own intuition.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
So I just really encourage you, whatever your stake is in education --

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
whether you're a student, parent, teacher, policy maker, whatever --

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
insist on better math curriculum.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
We need more patient problem solvers. Thank you. (Applause)
