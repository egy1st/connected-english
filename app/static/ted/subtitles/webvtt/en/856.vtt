00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I have a daughter, Mulan.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
And when she was eight, last year,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
she was doing a report for school

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
or she had some homework about frogs.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And we were at this restaurant,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and she said, "So, basically,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
frogs lay eggs

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and the eggs turn into tadpoles,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and tadpoles turn into frogs."

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And I said, "Yeah. You know, I'm not really up on my frog reproduction that much.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It's the females, I think, that lay the eggs,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and then the males fertilize them.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And then they become tadpoles and frogs."

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And she says, "What? Only the females have eggs?"

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And I said, "Yeah."

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And she goes, "And what's this fertilizing?"

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So I kind of said, "Oh, it's this extra ingredient,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
you know, that you need

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
to create a new frog

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
from the mom and dad frog." (Laughter)

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And she said, "Oh, so is that true for humans too?"

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And I thought, "Okay, here we go."

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I didn't know it would happen so quick, at eight.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I was trying to remember all the guidebooks,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and all I could remember was,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
"Only answer the question they're asking.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Don't give any more information." (Laughter)

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So I said, "Yes."

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And she said, "And where do, um,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
where do human women,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
like, where do women lay their eggs?"

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And I said, "Well,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
funny you should ask. (Laughter)

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
We have evolved to have our own pond.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
We have our very own pond inside our bodies.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And we lay our eggs there,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
we don't have to worry about other eggs or anything like that.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
It's our own pond. And that's how it happens."

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And she goes, "Then how do they get fertilized?"

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And I said, "Well,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Men, through their penis,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
they fertilize the eggs by the sperm coming out.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And you go through the woman's vagina."

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And so we're just eating, and her jaw just drops,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and she goes, "Mom!

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Like, where you go to the bathroom?"

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And I said, "I know.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I know."

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
(Laughter)

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
That's how we evolved. It does seem odd.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
It is a little bit like having a waste treatment plant

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
right next to an amusement park ...

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Bad zoning, but ..." (Laughter)

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
She's like, "What?" And she goes, "But Mom,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
but men and women can't ever see each other naked, Mom.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
So how could that ever happen?"

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And then I go, "Well," and then I put my Margaret Mead hat on.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
"Human males and females

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
develop a special bond,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and when they're much older, much, much older than you,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and they have a very special feeling,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
then they can be naked together."

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And she said, "Mom,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
have you done this before?"

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And I said, "Yes."

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And she said, "But Mom, you can't have kids."

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Because she knows that I adopted her and that I can't have kids.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And I said, "Yes."

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And she said, "Well, you don't have to do that again."

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And I said, "..."

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And then she said, "But how does it happen when a man and woman are together?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Like, how do they know that's the time?

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Mom, does the man just say,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
'Is now the time to take off my pants?'"

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
(Laughter)

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And I said, "Yes."

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
(Laughter)

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
"That is exactly right.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
That's exactly how it happens."

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
So we're driving home and she's looking out the window, and she goes,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
"Mom. What if two just people saw each other on the street,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
like a man and a woman, they just started doing it. Would that ever happen?"

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And I said, "Oh, no. Humans are so private.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Oh ..."

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
And then she goes, "What if there was like a party,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
and there was just like a whole bunch of girls and a whole bunch of boys,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and there was a bunch of men and women and they just started doing it, Mom?

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Would that ever happen?"

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And I said, "Oh, no, no.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
That's not how we do it."

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Then we got home and we see the cat. And she goes,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
"Mom, how do cats do it?"

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
And I go, "Oh, it's the same. It's basically the same."

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And then she got all caught up in the legs. "But how would the legs go, Mom?

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
I don't understand the legs."

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
She goes, "Mom, everyone can't do the splits."

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
And I go, "I know, but the legs ..."

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
and I'm probably like, "The legs get worked out."

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And she goes, "But I just can't understand it."

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
So I go, "You know, why don't we go on the Internet,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
and maybe we can see ... like on Wikipedia." (Laughter)

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
So we go online, and we put in "cats mating."

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And, unfortunately, on YouTube, there's many cats mating videos.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And we watched them and I'm so thankful,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
because she's just like, "Wow! This is so amazing."

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
She goes, "What about dogs?"

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
So we put in dogs mating, and,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
you know, we're watching it, and she's totally absorbed.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And then she goes, "Mom,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
do you think they would have, on the Internet,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
any humans mating?"

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
(Laughter)

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
And then I realized that

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
I had taken my little eight year old's hand,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and taken her right into Internet porn. (Laughter)

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
And I looked into this

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
trusting, loving face,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
and I said,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
"Oh, no.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
That would never happen."

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Thank you.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
(Applause)

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Thank you.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
(Applause)

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Thank you. I'm so happy to be here.
