00:00:02.357 --> 00:00:03.507
Good afternoon.

00:00:04.229 --> 00:00:06.976
There's a medical revolution
happening all around us,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.096
and it's one that's going
to help us conquer

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.120
some of society's most dreaded conditions,

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:12.350
including cancer.

00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:16.635
The revolution is called angiogenesis,

00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:20.620
and it's based on the process
that our bodies use to grow blood vessels.

00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:23.326
So why should we care about blood vessels?

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.158
Well, the human body
is literally packed with them --

00:00:26.182 --> 00:00:29.166
60,000 miles worth in a typical adult.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.174
End to end, that would form a line
that would circle the earth twice.

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.786
The smallest blood vessels
are called capillaries.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.976
We've got 19 billion of them
in our bodies.

00:00:40.377 --> 00:00:43.160
And these are the vessels of life,

00:00:43.184 --> 00:00:46.614
and as I'll show you,
they can also be the vessels of death.

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:50.177
Now, the remarkable thing
about blood vessels

00:00:50.201 --> 00:00:52.058
is that they have this ability

00:00:52.082 --> 00:00:54.795
to adapt to whatever environment
they're growing in.

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:58.076
For example, in the liver,
they form channels to detoxify the blood;

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.831
in the lungs, they line air sacs
for gas exchange.

00:01:00.855 --> 00:01:02.594
In muscle, they corkscrew,

00:01:02.618 --> 00:01:05.854
so that muscles can contract
without cutting off circulation.

00:01:05.878 --> 00:01:08.401
And in nerves, they course along
like power lines,

00:01:08.425 --> 00:01:09.846
keeping those nerves alive.

00:01:10.449 --> 00:01:12.480
We get most of these blood vessels

00:01:12.504 --> 00:01:14.401
when we're actually still in the womb.

00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:16.976
And what that means is that as adults,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.247
blood vessels don't normally grow.

00:01:19.271 --> 00:01:22.000
Except in a few special circumstances.

00:01:22.787 --> 00:01:24.976
In women, blood vessels grow every month,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.817
to build the lining of the uterus.

00:01:26.841 --> 00:01:29.268
During pregnancy, they form the placenta,

00:01:29.292 --> 00:01:31.529
which connects mom and baby.

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:36.299
And after injury, blood vessels
actually have to grow under the scab

00:01:36.323 --> 00:01:37.976
in order to heal a wound.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.927
And this is actually what it looks like,

00:01:39.951 --> 00:01:43.367
hundreds of blood vessels, all growing
toward the center of the wound.

00:01:44.121 --> 00:01:46.908
So the body has the ability to regulate

00:01:46.932 --> 00:01:50.000
the amount of blood vessels
that are present at any given time.

00:01:50.024 --> 00:01:54.412
It does this through an elaborate
and elegant system of checks and balances,

00:01:54.436 --> 00:01:57.301
stimulators and inhibitors
of angiogenesis,

00:01:57.325 --> 00:01:59.976
such that, when we need
a brief burst of blood vessels,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.976
the body can do this
by releasing stimulators,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.198
proteins called angiogenic factors,

00:02:05.222 --> 00:02:09.388
that act as natural fertilizer,
and stimulate new blood vessels to sprout.

00:02:09.412 --> 00:02:11.653
When those excess vessels
are no longer needed,

00:02:11.677 --> 00:02:14.264
the body prunes them back to baseline,

00:02:14.288 --> 00:02:17.288
using naturally-occurring
inhibitors of angiogenesis.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.293
There are other situations
where we start beneath the baseline,

00:02:21.317 --> 00:02:24.969
and we need to grow more blood vessels,
just to get back to normal levels --

00:02:24.993 --> 00:02:26.496
for example, after an injury --

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.371
and the body can do that too,
but only to that normal level,

00:02:29.395 --> 00:02:30.545
that set point.

00:02:31.112 --> 00:02:33.976
But what we now know,
is that for a number of diseases,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.385
there are defects in the system,

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:38.910
where the body can't prune back
extra blood vessels,

00:02:38.934 --> 00:02:42.534
or can't grow enough new ones
in the right place at the right time.

00:02:42.884 --> 00:02:46.709
And in these situations,
angiogenesis is out of balance.

00:02:47.193 --> 00:02:49.121
And when angiogenesis is out of balance,

00:02:49.145 --> 00:02:50.899
a myriad of diseases result.

00:02:51.304 --> 00:02:54.976
For example, insufficient angiogenesis --
not enough blood vessels --

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.976
leads to wounds
that don't heal, heart attacks,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.615
legs without circulation,
death from stroke,

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:01.790
nerve damage.

00:03:02.457 --> 00:03:04.774
And on the other end,
excessive angiogenesis --

00:03:04.798 --> 00:03:06.975
too many blood vessels -- drives disease,

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:09.587
and we see this in cancer, blindness,

00:03:09.611 --> 00:03:12.460
arthritis, obesity, Alzheimer's disease.

00:03:13.306 --> 00:03:16.449
In total, there are more
than 70 major diseases

00:03:16.473 --> 00:03:18.942
affecting more than a billion
people worldwide,

00:03:18.966 --> 00:03:21.934
that all look on the surface to be
different from one another,

00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.776
but all actually share
abnormal angiogenesis

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.521
as their common denominator.

00:03:27.371 --> 00:03:30.448
And this realization is allowing
us to re-conceptualize

00:03:30.472 --> 00:03:32.884
the way that we actually
approach these diseases,

00:03:32.908 --> 00:03:34.892
by controlling angiogenesis.

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:37.738
Now, I'm going to focus on cancer,

00:03:37.762 --> 00:03:41.229
because angiogenesis
is a hallmark of cancer --

00:03:41.253 --> 00:03:42.681
every type of cancer.

00:03:43.253 --> 00:03:44.407
So here we go.

00:03:44.946 --> 00:03:48.836
This is a tumor: dark, gray, ominous
mass growing inside a brain.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.109
And under the microscope,

00:03:50.133 --> 00:03:53.146
you can see hundreds
of these brown-stained blood vessels,

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.217
capillaries that are feeding cancer cells,

00:03:55.241 --> 00:03:57.194
bringing oxygen and nutrients.

00:03:58.289 --> 00:04:00.368
But cancers don't start out like this,

00:04:00.392 --> 00:04:03.278
and in fact, cancers don't start out
with a blood supply.

00:04:03.691 --> 00:04:07.327
They start out as small,
microscopic nests of cells,

00:04:07.351 --> 00:04:11.655
that can only grow to one half
a cubic millimeter in size.

00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:13.534
That's the tip of a ballpoint pen.

00:04:13.851 --> 00:04:17.161
Then they can't get any larger
because they don't have a blood supply,

00:04:17.185 --> 00:04:19.340
so they don't have
enough oxygen or nutrients.

00:04:19.364 --> 00:04:22.689
In fact, we're probably forming
these microscopic cancers

00:04:22.713 --> 00:04:24.855
all the time in our body.

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:28.441
Autopsy studies from people
who died in car accidents

00:04:28.465 --> 00:04:33.291
have shown that about 40 percent of women
between the ages of 40 and 50

00:04:33.315 --> 00:04:37.196
actually have microscopic
cancers in their breasts.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.561
About 50 percent of men
in their 50s and 60s

00:04:39.585 --> 00:04:42.114
have microscopic prostate cancers,

00:04:42.138 --> 00:04:45.805
and virtually 100 percent of us,
by the time we reach our 70s,

00:04:45.829 --> 00:04:48.510
will have microscopic cancers
growing in our thyroid.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.976
Yet, without a blood supply,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.272
most of these cancers
will never become dangerous.

00:04:55.407 --> 00:04:57.613
Dr. Judah Folkman, who was my mentor

00:04:57.637 --> 00:05:00.033
and who was the pioneer
of the angiogenesis field,

00:05:00.057 --> 00:05:03.549
once called this "cancer without disease."

00:05:04.625 --> 00:05:07.430
So the body's ability
to balance angiogenesis,

00:05:07.454 --> 00:05:08.976
when it's working properly,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.256
prevents blood vessels
from feeding cancers.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.976
And this turns out to be

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.776
one of our most important
defense mechanisms

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.029
against cancer.

00:05:18.212 --> 00:05:20.473
In fact, if you actually
block angiogenesis

00:05:20.497 --> 00:05:23.266
and prevent blood vessels
from ever reaching cancer cells,

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:24.691
tumors simply can't grow up.

00:05:24.715 --> 00:05:26.468
But once angiogenesis occurs,

00:05:26.492 --> 00:05:28.675
cancers can grow exponentially.

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:33.698
And this is actually how a cancer
goes from being harmless,

00:05:33.722 --> 00:05:34.889
to being deadly.

00:05:35.658 --> 00:05:36.976
Cancer cells mutate,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.287
and they gain the ability to release
lots of those angiogenic factors,

00:05:40.311 --> 00:05:41.482
natural fertilizer,

00:05:41.506 --> 00:05:44.952
that tip the balance in favor
of blood vessels invading the cancer.

00:05:44.976 --> 00:05:46.976
And once those vessels invade the cancer,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.976
it can expand,
it can invade local tissues,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.301
and the same vessels
that are feeding tumors

00:05:52.325 --> 00:05:56.539
allow cancer cells to exit
into the circulation as metastases.

00:05:57.428 --> 00:06:00.182
And unfortunately,
this late stage of cancer

00:06:00.206 --> 00:06:04.166
is the one at which
it's most likely to be diagnosed,

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.205
when angiogenesis is already turned on,

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:08.793
and cancer cells are growing like wild.

00:06:09.737 --> 00:06:13.842
So, if angiogenesis is a tipping point

00:06:13.866 --> 00:06:16.976
between a harmless cancer
and a harmful one,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.274
then one major part
of the angiogenesis revolution

00:06:20.298 --> 00:06:22.053
is a new approach to treating cancer

00:06:22.077 --> 00:06:23.854
by cutting off the blood supply.

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:28.117
We call this antiangiogenic therapy,

00:06:28.141 --> 00:06:30.419
and it's completely different
from chemotherapy,

00:06:30.443 --> 00:06:32.323
because it selectively aims

00:06:32.347 --> 00:06:34.884
at the blood vessels
that are feeding the cancers.

00:06:35.384 --> 00:06:39.819
We can do this because tumor blood vessels
are unlike normal, healthy vessels

00:06:39.843 --> 00:06:41.633
we see in other places of the body --

00:06:41.657 --> 00:06:44.781
they're abnormal,
they're very poorly constructed,

00:06:44.805 --> 00:06:47.059
and because of that,
they're highly vulnerable

00:06:47.083 --> 00:06:48.892
to treatments that target them.

00:06:50.666 --> 00:06:54.198
In effect, when we give cancer patients
antiangiogenic therapy --

00:06:54.222 --> 00:06:57.206
here, an experimental drug for a glioma,

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:58.976
which is a type of brain tumor --

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.782
you can see that there are
dramatic changes that occur

00:07:01.806 --> 00:07:03.608
when the tumor is being starved.

00:07:04.703 --> 00:07:06.607
Here's a woman with a breast cancer,

00:07:06.631 --> 00:07:09.555
being treated with the antiangiogenic
drug called Avastin,

00:07:09.579 --> 00:07:11.547
which is FDA approved.

00:07:11.571 --> 00:07:14.264
And you can see
that the halo of blood flow

00:07:14.288 --> 00:07:16.273
disappears after treatment.

00:07:17.463 --> 00:07:20.976
Well, I've just shown you
two very different types of cancer

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.769
that both responded
to antiangiogenic therapy.

00:07:24.166 --> 00:07:26.325
So a few years ago, I asked myself,

00:07:26.349 --> 00:07:30.285
"Can we take this one step further
and treat other cancers,

00:07:30.309 --> 00:07:32.102
even in other species?"

00:07:33.888 --> 00:07:36.278
So here is a nine year-old
boxer named Milo,

00:07:36.302 --> 00:07:37.976
who had a very aggressive tumor

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.008
called a malignant neurofibroma
growing on his shoulder.

00:07:41.032 --> 00:07:42.617
It invaded into his lungs.

00:07:42.641 --> 00:07:45.125
His veterinarian only gave him
three months to live.

00:07:45.149 --> 00:07:47.976
So we created a cocktail
of antiangiogenic drugs

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.976
that could be mixed into his dog food,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.253
as well as an antiangiogenic cream,

00:07:52.277 --> 00:07:54.845
that could be applied
on the surface of the tumor.

00:07:55.277 --> 00:07:57.412
And within a few weeks of treatment,

00:07:57.436 --> 00:07:59.762
we were able to slow down
that cancer's growth,

00:07:59.786 --> 00:08:03.039
such that we were ultimately
able to extend Milo’s survival

00:08:03.063 --> 00:08:06.682
to six times what the veterinarian
had initially predicted,

00:08:06.706 --> 00:08:08.671
all with a very good quality of life.

00:08:09.306 --> 00:08:11.976
And we've subsequently treated
more than 600 dogs.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.270
We have about a 60 percent response rate,

00:08:14.294 --> 00:08:16.706
and improved survival for these pets

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:18.484
that were about to be euthanized.

00:08:19.254 --> 00:08:22.559
So let me show you a couple
of even more interesting examples.

00:08:23.154 --> 00:08:25.479
This is 20-year-old dolphin
living in Florida,

00:08:25.503 --> 00:08:27.654
and she had these lesions in her mouth

00:08:27.678 --> 00:08:29.464
that, over the course of three years,

00:08:29.488 --> 00:08:32.070
developed into invasive
squamous cell cancers.

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:35.070
So we created an antiangiogenic paste.

00:08:35.372 --> 00:08:38.976
We had it painted on top of the cancer
three times a week.

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:41.498
And over the course of seven months,

00:08:41.522 --> 00:08:43.236
the cancers completely disappeared,

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.553
and the biopsies came back as normal.

00:08:47.633 --> 00:08:49.339
Here's a cancer growing on the lip

00:08:49.363 --> 00:08:51.331
of a Quarter Horse named Guinness.

00:08:51.355 --> 00:08:54.458
It's a very, very deadly type
of cancer called an angiosarcoma.

00:08:54.482 --> 00:08:56.450
It had already spread to his lymph nodes,

00:08:56.474 --> 00:08:59.498
so we used an antiangiogenic
skin cream for the lip,

00:08:59.522 --> 00:09:04.103
and the oral cocktail, so we could treat
from the inside as well as the outside.

00:09:04.127 --> 00:09:06.254
And over the course of six months,

00:09:06.278 --> 00:09:08.103
he experienced a complete remission.

00:09:09.333 --> 00:09:12.484
And here he is six years later,

00:09:12.508 --> 00:09:15.389
Guinness, with his very happy owner.

00:09:15.413 --> 00:09:17.976
(Applause)

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.853
Now obviously, antiangiogenic therapy
could be used for a wide range of cancers.

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:25.535
And in fact, the first
pioneering treatments

00:09:25.559 --> 00:09:27.130
for people as well as dogs,

00:09:27.154 --> 00:09:28.790
are already becoming available.

00:09:28.814 --> 00:09:32.355
There are 12 different drugs,
11 different cancer types.

00:09:32.736 --> 00:09:33.976
But the real question is:

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.976
How well do these work in practice?

00:09:36.283 --> 00:09:39.396
So here's actually
the patient survival data

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:41.205
from eight different types of cancer.

00:09:41.229 --> 00:09:43.688
The bars represent survival time

00:09:43.712 --> 00:09:47.252
taken from the era in which
there was only chemotherapy,

00:09:47.276 --> 00:09:49.228
or surgery, or radiation available.

00:09:49.934 --> 00:09:52.307
But starting in 2004,

00:09:52.331 --> 00:09:54.957
when antiangiogenic therapies
first became available,

00:09:54.981 --> 00:09:59.891
you can see that there has been a 70
to 100 percent improvement in survival

00:09:59.915 --> 00:10:03.076
for people with kidney cancer,
multiple myeloma,

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:06.322
colorectal cancer,
and gastrointestinal stromal tumors.

00:10:07.179 --> 00:10:08.346
That's impressive.

00:10:08.981 --> 00:10:11.940
But for other tumors and cancer types,

00:10:11.964 --> 00:10:14.074
the improvements have only been modest.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.884
So I started asking myself,

00:10:16.908 --> 00:10:18.995
"Why haven't we been able to do better?"

00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:22.288
And the answer, to me, is obvious:

00:10:22.312 --> 00:10:24.614
we're treating cancer
too late in the game,

00:10:24.638 --> 00:10:26.297
when it's already established,

00:10:26.321 --> 00:10:28.976
and oftentimes, it's already
spread or metastasized.

00:10:29.472 --> 00:10:30.623
And as a doctor,

00:10:30.647 --> 00:10:34.489
I know that once a disease progresses
to an advanced stage,

00:10:34.513 --> 00:10:38.417
achieving a cure can be difficult,
if not impossible.

00:10:39.544 --> 00:10:45.428
So I went back to the biology
of angiogenesis, and started thinking:

00:10:45.452 --> 00:10:50.454
Could the answer to cancer
be preventing angiogenesis,

00:10:50.478 --> 00:10:52.343
beating cancer at its own game,

00:10:52.367 --> 00:10:55.000
so the cancers could never
become dangerous?

00:10:56.414 --> 00:10:58.096
This could help healthy people,

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:01.827
as well as people who've already
beaten cancer once or twice,

00:11:01.851 --> 00:11:04.593
and want to find a way
to keep it from coming back.

00:11:05.196 --> 00:11:07.976
So to look for a way to prevent
angiogenesis in cancer,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.976
I went back to look at cancer's causes.

00:11:10.572 --> 00:11:11.976
And what really intrigued me,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.333
was when I saw that diet
accounts for 30 to 35 percent

00:11:16.357 --> 00:11:18.275
of environmentally-caused cancers.

00:11:19.133 --> 00:11:22.847
Now the obvious thing is to think about
what we could remove from our diet,

00:11:22.871 --> 00:11:24.529
what to strip out, take away.

00:11:25.442 --> 00:11:28.233
But I actually took
a completely opposite approach,

00:11:28.257 --> 00:11:31.646
and began asking: What could
we be adding to our diet

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:34.151
that's naturally antiangiogenic,

00:11:34.175 --> 00:11:36.508
and that could boost
the body's defense system,

00:11:36.532 --> 00:11:39.611
and beat back those blood vessels
that are feeding cancers?

00:11:39.635 --> 00:11:43.032
In other words, can we eat
to starve cancer?

00:11:43.056 --> 00:11:44.381
(Laughter)

00:11:44.405 --> 00:11:47.150
Well, the answer is yes,
and I'm going to show you how.

00:11:47.174 --> 00:11:50.538
And our search for this
has taken us to the market,

00:11:50.562 --> 00:11:52.411
the farm and to the spice cabinet,

00:11:52.435 --> 00:11:53.897
because what we've discovered

00:11:53.921 --> 00:11:56.191
is that Mother Nature
has laced a large number

00:11:56.215 --> 00:11:57.976
of foods and beverages and herbs

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.490
with naturally-occurring
inhibitors of angiogenesis.

00:12:02.378 --> 00:12:04.077
Here's a test system we developed.

00:12:04.101 --> 00:12:05.260
At the center is a ring

00:12:05.284 --> 00:12:08.894
from which hundreds of blood vessels
are growing out in a starburst fashion.

00:12:08.918 --> 00:12:11.837
And we can use this system
to test dietary factors

00:12:11.861 --> 00:12:14.693
at concentrations
that are obtainable by eating.

00:12:15.709 --> 00:12:17.098
Let me show you what happens

00:12:17.122 --> 00:12:19.860
when we put in an extract from red grapes.

00:12:19.884 --> 00:12:21.976
The active ingredient is resveratrol,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.520
it's also found in red wine.

00:12:24.171 --> 00:12:26.976
This inhibits abnormal angiogenesis,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.166
by 60 percent.

00:12:29.277 --> 00:12:32.444
Here's what happens when we added
an extract from strawberries.

00:12:32.468 --> 00:12:34.976
It potently inhibits angiogenesis.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.375
And extract from soybeans.

00:12:38.725 --> 00:12:40.646
And here is a growing list

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:44.693
of antiangiogenic foods and beverages
that we're interested in studying.

00:12:45.312 --> 00:12:47.302
For each food type,

00:12:47.326 --> 00:12:49.548
we believe that there are
different potencies

00:12:49.572 --> 00:12:51.922
within different strains and varietals.

00:12:51.946 --> 00:12:54.177
And we want to measure this because,

00:12:54.201 --> 00:12:56.415
well, while you're eating a strawberry

00:12:56.439 --> 00:12:57.916
or drinking tea,

00:12:57.940 --> 00:12:59.976
why not select the one that's most potent

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.299
for preventing cancer?

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.076
So here are four different teas
that we've tested.

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:08.976
They're all common ones:
Chinese jasmine, Japanese sencha,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.620
Earl Grey and a special blend
that we prepared,

00:13:11.644 --> 00:13:15.345
and you can see clearly
that the teas vary in their potency,

00:13:15.369 --> 00:13:17.830
from less potent to more potent.

00:13:18.742 --> 00:13:20.226
But what's very cool

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:23.999
is when we combine
the two less potent teas together,

00:13:24.023 --> 00:13:28.316
the combination, the blend,
is more potent than either one alone.

00:13:29.285 --> 00:13:31.596
This means there's food synergy.

00:13:34.374 --> 00:13:36.263
Here's some more data from our testing.

00:13:36.287 --> 00:13:39.199
Now in the lab, we can
simulate tumor angiogenesis,

00:13:39.223 --> 00:13:41.214
represented here in a black bar.

00:13:41.238 --> 00:13:44.306
And using this system, we can test
the potency of cancer drugs.

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:45.862
So the shorter the bar,

00:13:45.886 --> 00:13:47.941
the less angiogenesis -- that's good.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.839
And here are some common drugs

00:13:50.863 --> 00:13:54.976
that have been associated with reducing
the risk of cancer in people.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.801
Statins, nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs,

00:13:57.825 --> 00:14:01.039
and a few others --
they inhibit angiogenesis, too.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.976
And here are the dietary factors

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.895
going head-to-head against these drugs.

00:14:06.919 --> 00:14:08.976
You can see they clearly hold their own,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.370
and in some cases, they're more potent
than the actual drugs.

00:14:12.751 --> 00:14:16.690
Soy, parsley, garlic, grapes, berries.

00:14:17.267 --> 00:14:20.473
I could go home and cook a tasty meal
using these ingredients.

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:25.548
Imagine if we could create
the world's first rating system,

00:14:25.572 --> 00:14:27.119
in which we could score foods

00:14:27.143 --> 00:14:30.760
according to their antiangiogenic,
cancer-preventative properties.

00:14:31.307 --> 00:14:33.300
And that's what we're doing right now.

00:14:34.339 --> 00:14:36.265
Now, I've shown you a bunch of lab data,

00:14:36.289 --> 00:14:38.073
and so the real question is:

00:14:38.097 --> 00:14:40.375
What is the evidence in people

00:14:40.399 --> 00:14:44.256
that eating certain foods can reduce
angiogenesis in cancer?

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:46.976
Well, the best example I know

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.061
is a study of 79,000 men
followed over 20 years,

00:14:51.085 --> 00:14:53.926
in which it was found that men
who consumed cooked tomatoes

00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:55.440
two to three times a week,

00:14:55.464 --> 00:14:57.976
had up to a 50 percent reduction

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.273
in their risk of developing
prostate cancer.

00:15:01.106 --> 00:15:04.412
Now, we know that tomatoes
are a good source of lycopene,

00:15:04.436 --> 00:15:06.976
and lycopene is antiangiogenic.

00:15:07.357 --> 00:15:09.675
But what's even more
interesting from this study,

00:15:09.699 --> 00:15:12.256
is that in those men who did
develop prostate cancer,

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:15.074
those who ate more
servings of tomato sauce,

00:15:15.098 --> 00:15:18.202
actually had fewer blood vessels
feeding their cancer.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.418
So this human study is a prime example

00:15:21.442 --> 00:15:26.368
of how antiangiogenic substances present
in food and consumed at practical levels,

00:15:26.392 --> 00:15:27.976
can have an impact on cancer.

00:15:28.676 --> 00:15:31.976
And we're now studying
the role of a healthy diet --

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.976
with Dean Ornish at UCSF
and Tufts University --

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.426
the role of this healthy diet
on markers of angiogenesis

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:40.353
that we can find in the bloodstream.

00:15:40.700 --> 00:15:44.422
Obviously, what I've shared with you
has some far-ranging implications,

00:15:44.446 --> 00:15:45.976
even beyond cancer research.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.252
Because if we're right,
it could impact consumer education,

00:15:49.276 --> 00:15:51.093
food services, public health

00:15:51.117 --> 00:15:52.976
and even the insurance industry.

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:55.126
And in fact, some insurance companies

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:57.460
are already beginning
to think along these lines.

00:15:57.484 --> 00:16:00.358
Check out this ad from BlueCross
BlueShield of Minnesota.

00:16:01.411 --> 00:16:03.086
For many people around the world,

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:06.872
dietary cancer prevention
may be the only practical solution,

00:16:06.896 --> 00:16:10.345
because not everybody can afford
expensive end-stage cancer treatments,

00:16:10.369 --> 00:16:13.060
but everybody could benefit
from a healthy diet

00:16:13.084 --> 00:16:16.706
based on local, sustainable,
antiangiogenic crops.

00:16:18.245 --> 00:16:20.443
Now, finally,

00:16:20.467 --> 00:16:22.150
I've talked to you about food,

00:16:22.174 --> 00:16:23.976
and I've talked to you about cancer,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.300
so there's just one more disease
that I have to tell you about,

00:16:27.324 --> 00:16:28.976
and that's obesity.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.976
Because it turns out
that adipose tissue -- fat --

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.976
is highly angiogenesis-dependent.

00:16:35.626 --> 00:16:38.396
And like a tumor, fat grows
when blood vessels grow.

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:39.638
So the question is:

00:16:39.662 --> 00:16:42.367
Can we shrink fat
by cutting off its blood supply?

00:16:43.470 --> 00:16:47.975
The top curve shows the body weight
of a genetically obese mouse

00:16:47.999 --> 00:16:51.149
that eats nonstop until it turns fat,

00:16:51.173 --> 00:16:52.827
like this furry tennis ball.

00:16:52.851 --> 00:16:54.037
(Laughter)

00:16:54.061 --> 00:16:57.252
And the bottom curve
is the weight of a normal mouse.

00:16:57.276 --> 00:16:58.578
If you take the obese mouse

00:16:58.602 --> 00:17:01.275
and give it an angiogenesis
inhibitor, it loses weight.

00:17:01.299 --> 00:17:05.241
Stop the treatment, gains the weight back.
Restart the treatment, loses the weight.

00:17:05.265 --> 00:17:07.376
Stop the treatment,
it gains the weight back.

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:09.757
And, in fact, you can cycle
the weight up and down

00:17:09.781 --> 00:17:11.773
simply by inhibiting angiogenesis.

00:17:11.797 --> 00:17:14.542
So this approach that we're taking
for cancer prevention

00:17:14.566 --> 00:17:16.884
may also have an application for obesity.

00:17:18.087 --> 00:17:20.191
The truly interesting thing about this

00:17:20.215 --> 00:17:22.191
is that we can't take these obese mice

00:17:22.215 --> 00:17:23.976
and make them lose more weight

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.769
than what the normal mouse's weight
is supposed to be.

00:17:27.221 --> 00:17:30.230
In other words,
we can't create supermodel mice.

00:17:30.254 --> 00:17:31.515
(Laughter)

00:17:31.539 --> 00:17:33.583
And this speaks to the role
of angiogenesis

00:17:33.607 --> 00:17:35.404
in regulating healthy set points.

00:17:36.504 --> 00:17:38.411
Albert Szent-Györgi once said,

00:17:38.435 --> 00:17:40.976
"Discovery consists of seeing
what everyone has seen,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.896
and thinking what no one has thought."

00:17:43.261 --> 00:17:44.691
I hope I've convinced you

00:17:44.715 --> 00:17:47.975
that for diseases like cancer,
obesity and other conditions,

00:17:47.999 --> 00:17:49.821
there may be a great power

00:17:49.845 --> 00:17:52.972
in attacking their common
denominator: angiogenesis.

00:17:52.996 --> 00:17:55.052
And that's what I think
the world needs now.

00:17:55.076 --> 00:17:56.227
Thank you.

00:17:56.251 --> 00:18:02.626
(Applause)

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:08.462
June Cohen: I have
a quick question for you.

00:18:08.486 --> 00:18:13.364
JC: So these drugs aren't exactly
in mainstream cancer treatments right now.

00:18:13.388 --> 00:18:16.976
For anyone out here who has cancer,
what would you recommend?

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.718
Do you recommend pursuing these
treatments now, for most cancer patients?

00:18:20.742 --> 00:18:22.950
William Li: There are
antiangiogenic treatments

00:18:22.974 --> 00:18:24.385
that are FDA approved,

00:18:24.409 --> 00:18:26.393
and if you're a cancer patient,

00:18:26.417 --> 00:18:30.328
or working for one or advocating for one,
you should ask about them.

00:18:30.352 --> 00:18:32.976
And there are many clinical trials.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.976
The Angiogenesis Foundation
is following almost 300 companies,

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.401
and there are about 100 more
drugs in that pipeline.

00:18:40.425 --> 00:18:41.976
So, consider the approved ones,

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.698
look for clinical trials,

00:18:43.722 --> 00:18:46.221
but then between
what the doctor can do for you,

00:18:46.245 --> 00:18:48.782
we need to start asking
what can we do for ourselves.

00:18:48.806 --> 00:18:50.886
This is one of the themes
I'm talking about:

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:52.065
We can empower ourselves

00:18:52.089 --> 00:18:54.276
to do the things that doctors
can't do for us,

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.372
which is to use knowledge and take action.

00:18:56.396 --> 00:18:58.976
And if Mother Nature
has given us some clues,

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.252
we think there might be a new future
in the value of how we eat,

00:19:03.276 --> 00:19:06.374
and what we eat is really
our chemotherapy three times a day.

00:19:06.398 --> 00:19:08.447
JC: Right. And along those lines,

00:19:08.471 --> 00:19:10.976
for people who might have
risk factors for cancer,

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.239
would you recommend pursuing
any treatments prophylactically,

00:19:14.263 --> 00:19:16.471
or simply pursuing the right diet,

00:19:16.495 --> 00:19:17.976
with lots of tomato sauce?

00:19:18.279 --> 00:19:21.477
WL: Well, you know, there's abundant
epidemiological evidence,

00:19:21.501 --> 00:19:23.192
and I think in the information age,

00:19:23.216 --> 00:19:26.055
it doesn't take long to go
to a credible source like PubMed,

00:19:26.079 --> 00:19:27.665
the National Library of Medicine,

00:19:27.689 --> 00:19:30.975
to look for epidemiological studies
for cancer risk reduction

00:19:30.999 --> 00:19:33.869
based on diet and based
on common medications.

00:19:33.893 --> 00:19:36.640
And that's certainly something
that anybody can look into.

00:19:36.664 --> 00:19:38.310
JC: Okay. Well, thank you so much.

00:19:38.334 --> 00:19:40.325
