00:00:00.603 --> 00:00:03.904
On September 10, the morning
of my seventh birthday,

00:00:03.928 --> 00:00:07.319
I came downstairs to the kitchen,
where my mother was washing the dishes

00:00:07.343 --> 00:00:09.976
and my father was reading
the paper or something,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.286
and I sort of presented myself to them
in the doorway, and they said,

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:17.976
"Hey, happy birthday!"
And I said, "I'm seven."

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.976
And my father smiled and said,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.386
"Well, you know
what that means, don't you?"

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.236
And I said, "Yeah,
that I'm going to have a party

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.483
and a cake and get a lot of presents?"

00:00:27.507 --> 00:00:29.718
And my dad said, "Well, yes.

00:00:29.742 --> 00:00:30.902
But more importantly,

00:00:30.926 --> 00:00:33.871
being seven means that
you've reached the age of reason,

00:00:33.895 --> 00:00:38.422
and you're now capable of committing
any and all sins against God and man."

00:00:38.446 --> 00:00:41.298
(Laughter)

00:00:41.322 --> 00:00:44.548
Now, I had heard this phrase,
"age of reason," before.

00:00:44.572 --> 00:00:46.823
Sister Mary Kevin
had been bandying it about

00:00:46.847 --> 00:00:48.544
my second-grade class at school.

00:00:48.568 --> 00:00:49.720
But when she said it,

00:00:49.744 --> 00:00:52.805
the phrase seemed all caught up
in the excitement of preparations

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.136
for our first communion
and our first confession,

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.986
and everybody knew that was really
all about the white dress

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.161
and the white veil.

00:00:59.185 --> 00:01:01.825
And anyway, I hadn't really paid
all that much attention

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:03.688
to that phrase, "age of reason."

00:01:03.712 --> 00:01:07.900
So, I said, "Yeah, yeah, age of reason.
What does that mean again?"

00:01:07.924 --> 00:01:11.554
And my dad said, "Well, we believe,
in the Catholic Church,

00:01:11.578 --> 00:01:15.455
that God knows that little kids don't know
the difference between right and wrong,

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.117
but when you're seven,
you're old enough to know better.

00:01:18.141 --> 00:01:20.756
So, you've grown up
and reached the age of reason,

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.397
and now God will start
keeping notes on you,

00:01:23.421 --> 00:01:25.377
and begin your permanent record."

00:01:25.401 --> 00:01:26.411
(Laughter)

00:01:26.435 --> 00:01:29.116
And I said, "Oh ...

00:01:30.767 --> 00:01:31.982
Wait a minute.

00:01:32.006 --> 00:01:35.180
You mean all that time, up till today,

00:01:35.204 --> 00:01:39.352
all that time I was so good,
God didn't notice it?"

00:01:39.376 --> 00:01:41.976
And my mom said, "Well, I noticed it."

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.976
(Laughter)

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.585
And I thought, "How could
I not have known this before?

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:49.339
How could it not have sunk in
when they'd been telling me?

00:01:49.363 --> 00:01:51.531
All that being good
and no real credit for it.

00:01:51.555 --> 00:01:53.764
And worst of all,
how could I not have realized

00:01:53.788 --> 00:01:55.272
this very important information

00:01:55.296 --> 00:01:58.218
until the very day
that it was basically useless to me?"

00:01:58.242 --> 00:02:01.608
So I said, "Well, Mom and Dad,
what about Santa Claus?

00:02:01.632 --> 00:02:04.976
I mean, Santa Claus knows
if you're naughty or nice, right?"

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.976
And my dad said, "Yeah, but, honey,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.265
I think that's technically just
between Thanksgiving and Christmas."

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.701
And my mother said, "Oh, Bob, stop it.
Let's just tell her. I mean, she's seven.

00:02:14.725 --> 00:02:17.061
Julie, there is no Santa Claus."

00:02:17.085 --> 00:02:20.156
(Laughter)

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.895
Now, this was actually
not that upsetting to me.

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:26.865
My parents had this whole
elaborate story about Santa Claus:

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:29.395
how they had talked to Santa Claus
himself and agreed

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:31.520
that instead of Santa
delivering our presents

00:02:31.544 --> 00:02:33.083
over the night of Christmas Eve,

00:02:33.107 --> 00:02:36.222
like he did for every other family
who got to open their surprises

00:02:36.246 --> 00:02:37.692
first thing Christmas morning,

00:02:37.716 --> 00:02:39.683
our family would give Santa more time.

00:02:39.707 --> 00:02:43.286
Santa would come to our house
while we were at nine o'clock high mass

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.976
on Christmas morning, but only
if all of us kids did not make a fuss.

00:02:47.302 --> 00:02:49.195
Which made me very suspicious.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.071
It was pretty obvious that it was really
our parents giving us the presents.

00:02:54.095 --> 00:02:56.976
I mean, my dad had a very
distinctive wrapping style,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.649
and my mother's handwriting
was so close to Santa's.

00:02:59.673 --> 00:03:00.831
(Laughter)

00:03:00.855 --> 00:03:03.588
Plus, why would Santa save time
by having to loop back

00:03:03.612 --> 00:03:06.365
to our house after he'd gone
to everybody else's?

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.510
There was only one obvious conclusion
to reach from this mountain of evidence:

00:03:10.534 --> 00:03:15.047
our family was too strange and weird
for even Santa Claus to come visit,

00:03:15.071 --> 00:03:18.326
and my poor parents were trying
to protect us from the embarrassment,

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.111
this humiliation of rejection
by Santa, who was jolly --

00:03:22.135 --> 00:03:24.786
but let's face it,
he was also very judgmental.

00:03:25.214 --> 00:03:27.777
So to find out that there was
no Santa Claus at all

00:03:27.801 --> 00:03:29.506
was actually sort of a relief.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.935
I left the kitchen not really
in shock about Santa,

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.660
but rather, I was just dumbfounded

00:03:34.684 --> 00:03:37.728
about how I could have missed
this whole age of reason thing.

00:03:37.752 --> 00:03:40.976
It was too late for me,
but maybe I could help someone else,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.976
someone who could use the information.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.173
They had to fit two criteria:

00:03:45.197 --> 00:03:47.538
they had to be old enough
to be able to understand

00:03:47.562 --> 00:03:50.733
the whole concept of the age
of reason, and not yet seven.

00:03:51.125 --> 00:03:53.976
The answer was clear:
my brother Bill. He was six.

00:03:54.277 --> 00:03:55.539
Well, I finally found Bill

00:03:55.563 --> 00:03:58.772
about a block away from our house
at this public school playground.

00:03:58.796 --> 00:04:00.912
It was a Saturday,
and he was all by himself,

00:04:00.936 --> 00:04:03.142
just kicking a ball
against the side of a wall.

00:04:03.166 --> 00:04:04.976
I ran up to him and said, "Bill!

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.143
I just realized that the age of reason
starts when you turn seven,

00:04:08.167 --> 00:04:10.713
and then you're capable
of committing any and all sins

00:04:10.737 --> 00:04:11.888
against God and man."

00:04:11.912 --> 00:04:13.539
And Bill said, "So?"

00:04:13.924 --> 00:04:15.910
And I said, "So, you're six.

00:04:15.934 --> 00:04:19.972
You have a whole year to do anything
you want to and God won't notice it."

00:04:19.996 --> 00:04:21.738
And he said, "So?"

00:04:21.762 --> 00:04:25.333
And I said, "So? So everything!"

00:04:25.357 --> 00:04:28.182
And I turned to run.
I was so angry with him.

00:04:28.206 --> 00:04:30.080
But when I got to the top of the steps,

00:04:30.104 --> 00:04:31.921
I turned around dramatically and said,

00:04:31.945 --> 00:04:35.376
"Oh, by the way, Bill --
there is no Santa Claus."

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.328
(Laughter)

00:04:37.352 --> 00:04:39.091
Now, I didn't know it at the time,

00:04:39.115 --> 00:04:41.761
but I really wasn't turning seven
on September 10th.

00:04:42.285 --> 00:04:43.610
For my 13th birthday,

00:04:43.634 --> 00:04:46.205
I planned a slumber party
with all of my girlfriends,

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:49.831
but a couple of weeks beforehand
my mother took me aside and said,

00:04:49.855 --> 00:04:53.077
"I need to speak to you privately.

00:04:53.101 --> 00:04:57.082
September 10th is not your birthday.
It's October 10th."

00:04:57.106 --> 00:04:58.655
And I said, "What?"

00:04:58.679 --> 00:04:59.694
(Laughter)

00:04:59.718 --> 00:05:00.979
And she said ...

00:05:01.003 --> 00:05:02.557
(Laughter)

00:05:02.581 --> 00:05:07.976
"Listen. The cut-off date to start
kindergarten was September 15th."

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.203
(Laughter)

00:05:09.227 --> 00:05:12.044
"So I told them that your birthday
was September 10th,

00:05:12.068 --> 00:05:13.219
and then I wasn't sure

00:05:13.243 --> 00:05:16.111
that you weren't just going to go
blab it all over the place,

00:05:16.135 --> 00:05:19.817
so I started to tell you
your birthday was September 10th.

00:05:19.841 --> 00:05:24.046
But, Julie, you were so ready to start
school, honey. You were so ready."

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.976
I thought about it, and when I was four,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
I was already the oldest of four children,

00:05:28.024 --> 00:05:30.143
and my mother even had
another child to come,

00:05:30.167 --> 00:05:32.672
so what I think she --
understandably -- really meant

00:05:32.696 --> 00:05:35.071
was that she was so ready,
she was so ready.

00:05:35.095 --> 00:05:36.769
Then she said, "Don't worry, Julie.

00:05:36.793 --> 00:05:38.262
Every year on October 10th,

00:05:38.286 --> 00:05:41.136
when it was your birthday
but you didn't realize it,

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.976
I made sure that you ate
a piece of cake that day."

00:05:44.401 --> 00:05:47.228
(Laughter)

00:05:47.252 --> 00:05:49.546
Which was comforting, but troubling.

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.109
My mother had been celebrating
my birthday with me, without me.

00:05:53.133 --> 00:05:54.141
(Laughter)

00:05:54.165 --> 00:05:57.154
What was so upsetting
about this new piece of information

00:05:57.178 --> 00:05:59.853
was not that I had to change
the date of my slumber party

00:05:59.877 --> 00:06:01.179
with all of my girlfriends.

00:06:01.203 --> 00:06:05.063
What was most upsetting
was that this meant I was not a Virgo.

00:06:05.087 --> 00:06:08.162
I had a huge Virgo poster in my bedroom.

00:06:08.186 --> 00:06:10.759
And I read my horoscope every single day,

00:06:10.783 --> 00:06:12.976
and it was so totally me.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.976
(Laughter)

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.976
And this meant that I was a Libra?

00:06:17.753 --> 00:06:21.067
So, I took the bus downtown
to get the new Libra poster.

00:06:21.091 --> 00:06:24.488
The Virgo poster is a picture
of a beautiful woman with long hair,

00:06:24.512 --> 00:06:26.044
sort of lounging by some water,

00:06:26.068 --> 00:06:28.520
but the Libra poster is just a huge scale.

00:06:28.926 --> 00:06:31.893
This was around the time
that I started filling out physically,

00:06:31.917 --> 00:06:34.900
and I was filling out a lot more
than a lot of the other girls,

00:06:34.924 --> 00:06:38.628
and frankly, the whole idea
that my astrological sign was a scale

00:06:38.652 --> 00:06:40.976
just seemed ominous and depressing.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.145
(Laughter)

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:45.976
But I got the new Libra poster,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.277
and I started to read
my new Libra horoscope,

00:06:49.301 --> 00:06:53.727
and I was astonished to find
that it was also totally me.

00:06:53.751 --> 00:06:55.287
(Laughter)

00:06:55.311 --> 00:06:57.292
It wasn't until years later, looking back

00:06:57.316 --> 00:06:59.975
on this whole age-of-reason,
change-of-birthday thing,

00:06:59.999 --> 00:07:01.286
that it dawned on me:

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.833
I wasn't turning seven
when I thought I turned seven.

00:07:03.857 --> 00:07:05.103
I had a whole other month

00:07:05.127 --> 00:07:08.865
to do anything I wanted to
before God started keeping tabs on me.

00:07:09.238 --> 00:07:11.476
Oh, life can be so cruel.

00:07:13.317 --> 00:07:16.715
One day, two Mormon
missionaries came to my door.

00:07:17.192 --> 00:07:19.828
Now, I just live off a main
thoroughfare in Los Angeles,

00:07:19.852 --> 00:07:22.151
and my block is -- well,
it's a natural beginning

00:07:22.175 --> 00:07:24.564
for people who are peddling
things door to door.

00:07:24.588 --> 00:07:27.976
Sometimes I get little old ladies
from the Seventh Day Adventist Church

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.162
showing me these cartoon
pictures of heaven.

00:07:30.186 --> 00:07:32.426
And sometimes I get
teenagers who promise me

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:35.305
that they won't join a gang
and just start robbing people,

00:07:35.329 --> 00:07:38.087
if I only buy some
magazine subscriptions from them.

00:07:38.556 --> 00:07:42.976
So normally, I just ignore the doorbell,
but on this day, I answered.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.285
And there stood two boys, each about 19,
in white, starched short-sleeved shirts,

00:07:48.309 --> 00:07:49.769
and they had little name tags

00:07:49.793 --> 00:07:52.086
that identified them
as official representatives

00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:54.911
of the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-day Saints,

00:07:54.935 --> 00:07:57.751
and they said they had
a message for me, from God.

00:07:58.629 --> 00:08:03.824
I said, "A message for me? From God?"
And they said, "Yes."

00:08:03.848 --> 00:08:05.976
Now, I was raised
in the Pacific Northwest,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.087
around a lot of Church of Latter-day
Saints people and, you know,

00:08:09.111 --> 00:08:11.120
I've worked with them and even dated them,

00:08:11.144 --> 00:08:12.922
but I never really knew the doctrine,

00:08:12.946 --> 00:08:15.758
or what they said to people
when they were out on a mission,

00:08:15.782 --> 00:08:19.087
and I guess I was sort of curious,
so I said, "Well, please, come in."

00:08:19.111 --> 00:08:20.508
And they looked really happy,

00:08:20.532 --> 00:08:23.262
because I don't think this happens
to them all that often.

00:08:23.286 --> 00:08:24.293
(Laughter)

00:08:24.317 --> 00:08:28.439
And I sat them down,
and I got them glasses of water --

00:08:38.085 --> 00:08:39.640
Ok, I got it, I got it.

00:08:39.664 --> 00:08:41.069
I got them glasses of water.

00:08:41.093 --> 00:08:42.919
Don't touch my hair, that's the thing.

00:08:42.943 --> 00:08:45.928
(Laughter)

00:08:45.952 --> 00:08:48.976
You can't put a video
of myself in front of me

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.914
and expect me not to fix my hair.

00:08:50.938 --> 00:08:52.266
Ok.

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:55.639
(Laughter)

00:08:56.401 --> 00:08:58.792
So I sat them down
and I got them glasses of water,

00:08:58.816 --> 00:09:00.773
and after niceties, they said,

00:09:00.797 --> 00:09:03.409
"Do you believe that God loves you
with all his heart?"

00:09:03.433 --> 00:09:06.976
And I thought, "Well,
of course I believe in God,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.511
but you know, I don't like
that word 'heart,'

00:09:09.535 --> 00:09:11.976
because it anthropomorphizes God,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.653
and I don't like the word, 'his,'
either, because that sexualizes God."

00:09:16.677 --> 00:09:19.174
But I didn't want to argue
semantics with these boys,

00:09:19.198 --> 00:09:22.879
so after a very long,
uncomfortable pause, I said,

00:09:22.903 --> 00:09:26.838
"Yes, yes, I do. I feel very loved."

00:09:26.862 --> 00:09:28.838
And they looked at each other and smiled,

00:09:28.862 --> 00:09:30.933
like that was the right answer.

00:09:30.957 --> 00:09:32.640
And then they said, "Do you believe

00:09:32.664 --> 00:09:35.111
that we're all brothers
and sisters on this planet?"

00:09:35.135 --> 00:09:36.286
And I said, "Yes, I do."

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:39.662
And I was so relieved that it was
a question I could answer so quickly.

00:09:39.686 --> 00:09:42.777
And they said, "Well, then
we have a story to tell you."

00:09:42.801 --> 00:09:45.976
And they told me this story
all about this guy named Lehi,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.503
who lived in Jerusalem in 600 BC.

00:09:48.907 --> 00:09:53.456
Now, apparently in Jerusalem in 600 BC,
everyone was completely bad and evil.

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:56.976
Every single one of them:
man, woman, child, infant, fetus.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.636
And God came to Lehi and said to him,

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:02.545
"Put your family on a boat
and I will lead you out of here."

00:10:02.569 --> 00:10:03.976
And God did lead them.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.378
He led them to America.

00:10:07.172 --> 00:10:08.643
I said, "America?

00:10:08.667 --> 00:10:10.732
(Laughter)

00:10:10.756 --> 00:10:15.419
From Jerusalem to America
by boat in 600 BC?"

00:10:15.443 --> 00:10:16.976
And they said, "Yes."

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.855
(Laughter)

00:10:18.879 --> 00:10:21.143
Then they told me
how Lehi and his descendants

00:10:21.167 --> 00:10:24.042
reproduced and reproduced,
and over the course of 600 years,

00:10:24.066 --> 00:10:27.320
there were two great races of them,
the Nephites and the Lamanites,

00:10:27.344 --> 00:10:30.794
and the Nephites were totally good --
each and every one of them --

00:10:30.818 --> 00:10:32.985
and the Lamanites
were totally bad and evil --

00:10:33.009 --> 00:10:35.160
every single one of them
just bad to the bone.

00:10:35.184 --> 00:10:38.692
Then, after Jesus died
on the cross for our sins,

00:10:38.716 --> 00:10:39.883
on his way up to heaven,

00:10:39.907 --> 00:10:42.480
he stopped by America
and visited the Nephites.

00:10:42.504 --> 00:10:43.530
(Laughter)

00:10:43.554 --> 00:10:47.042
And he told them that if they all remained
totally, totally good --

00:10:47.066 --> 00:10:48.448
each and every one of them --

00:10:48.472 --> 00:10:51.173
they would win the war
against the evil Lamanites.

00:10:51.197 --> 00:10:53.698
But apparently somebody blew it,

00:10:53.722 --> 00:10:56.459
because the Lamanites
were able to kill all the Nephites.

00:10:56.483 --> 00:10:58.749
All but one guy, this guy named Mormon,

00:10:58.773 --> 00:11:01.519
who managed to survive
by hiding in the woods.

00:11:01.543 --> 00:11:04.253
And he made sure
this whole story was written down

00:11:04.277 --> 00:11:08.645
in reformed Egyptian hieroglyphics
chiseled onto gold plates,

00:11:08.669 --> 00:11:11.450
which he then buried
near Palmyra, New York.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:17.235
(Laughter)

00:11:17.259 --> 00:11:19.976
Well, I was just on the edge of my seat.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.342
(Laughter)

00:11:23.366 --> 00:11:26.218
I said, "What happened to the Lamanites?"

00:11:26.242 --> 00:11:30.084
And they said, "Well, they became
our Native Americans, here in the U.S."

00:11:30.108 --> 00:11:33.294
And I said, "So, you believe
the Native Americans are descended

00:11:33.318 --> 00:11:35.359
from a people who were totally evil?"

00:11:35.383 --> 00:11:37.240
And they said, "Yes."

00:11:37.627 --> 00:11:40.683
Then they told me
how this guy named Joseph Smith

00:11:40.707 --> 00:11:44.342
found those buried gold plates
right in his backyard,

00:11:44.366 --> 00:11:48.088
and he also found this magic stone
back there that he put into his hat

00:11:48.112 --> 00:11:49.610
and then buried his face into,

00:11:49.634 --> 00:11:51.994
and this allowed him
to translate the gold plates

00:11:52.018 --> 00:11:54.453
from the reformed Egyptian into English.

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:58.265
Well, at this point I just wanted to give
these two boys some advice

00:11:58.289 --> 00:11:59.718
about their pitch.

00:11:59.742 --> 00:12:02.583
(Laughter)

00:12:02.607 --> 00:12:03.767
I wanted to say --

00:12:03.791 --> 00:12:05.457
(Applause)

00:12:05.481 --> 00:12:07.747
"Ok, don't start with this story."

00:12:07.771 --> 00:12:08.976
(Laughter)

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.043
I mean, even the Scientologists

00:12:11.067 --> 00:12:14.352
know to start with a personality test
before they start --

00:12:14.376 --> 00:12:15.976
(Applause)

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.454
telling people all about Xenu,
the evil intergalactic overlord.

00:12:21.138 --> 00:12:23.725
Then, they said, "Do you believe
that God speaks to us

00:12:23.749 --> 00:12:25.289
through his righteous prophets?"

00:12:25.313 --> 00:12:26.566
And I said, "No, I don't,"

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:29.074
because I was sort of upset
about this Lamanite story

00:12:29.099 --> 00:12:30.651
and this crazy gold plate story,

00:12:30.675 --> 00:12:33.509
but the truth was,
I hadn't really thought this through,

00:12:33.533 --> 00:12:35.731
so I backpedaled a little and I said,

00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:38.642
"Well, what exactly
do you mean by 'righteous'?

00:12:38.666 --> 00:12:42.126
And what do you mean by prophets?
Like, could the prophets be women?"

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:45.696
And they said, "No." And I said, "Why?"

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:49.439
And they said, "Well, it's because
God gave women a gift

00:12:49.463 --> 00:12:51.434
that is so spectacular,

00:12:51.458 --> 00:12:56.235
it is so wonderful, that the only gift
he had left over to give men

00:12:56.259 --> 00:12:57.878
was the gift of prophecy."

00:12:58.656 --> 00:13:01.979
What is this wonderful gift
God gave women, I wondered?

00:13:02.003 --> 00:13:05.342
Maybe their greater ability
to cooperate and adapt?

00:13:05.366 --> 00:13:06.378
(Laughter)

00:13:06.402 --> 00:13:07.779
Women's longer lifespan?

00:13:07.803 --> 00:13:11.007
The fact that women tend to be
much less violent than men?

00:13:11.031 --> 00:13:13.289
But no -- it wasn't any of these gifts.

00:13:13.313 --> 00:13:16.377
They said, "Well, it's her ability
to bear children."

00:13:16.401 --> 00:13:17.829
I said, "Oh, come on.

00:13:17.853 --> 00:13:20.672
I mean, even if women
tried to have a baby every single year

00:13:20.696 --> 00:13:23.633
from the time they were 15
to the time they were 45,

00:13:23.657 --> 00:13:25.653
assuming they didn't die from exhaustion,

00:13:25.677 --> 00:13:28.565
it still seems like some women
would have some time left over

00:13:28.589 --> 00:13:30.035
to hear the word of God."

00:13:30.059 --> 00:13:31.976
And they said, "No."

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.976
(Laughter)

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.164
Well, then they didn't look so
fresh-faced and cute to me any more,

00:13:38.188 --> 00:13:39.393
but they had more to say.

00:13:39.417 --> 00:13:42.151
They said, "Well, we also believe
that if you're a Mormon,

00:13:42.175 --> 00:13:44.389
and if you're in good standing
with the church,

00:13:44.413 --> 00:13:46.549
when you die, you get to go to heaven

00:13:46.573 --> 00:13:49.354
and be with your family for all eternity."

00:13:49.378 --> 00:13:51.436
And I said, "Oh, dear.

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:58.364
(Laughter)

00:13:58.388 --> 00:14:00.587
That wouldn't be
such a good incentive for me."

00:14:00.611 --> 00:14:01.911
(Laughter)

00:14:01.935 --> 00:14:03.420
And they said, "Oh.

00:14:03.444 --> 00:14:04.803
(Laughter)

00:14:04.827 --> 00:14:07.872
Hey! Well, we also believe
that when you go to heaven,

00:14:07.896 --> 00:14:10.783
you get your body restored to you
in its best original state.

00:14:10.807 --> 00:14:13.237
Like, if you'd lost a leg,
well, you get it back.

00:14:13.261 --> 00:14:15.237
Or, if you'd gone blind, you could see."

00:14:15.261 --> 00:14:18.230
I said, "Oh. Now, I don't have a uterus,

00:14:18.254 --> 00:14:20.345
because I had cancer a few years ago.

00:14:20.369 --> 00:14:22.415
So does this mean
that if I went to heaven,

00:14:22.439 --> 00:14:24.471
I would get my old uterus back?"

00:14:24.495 --> 00:14:26.551
And they said, "Sure."

00:14:26.575 --> 00:14:32.340
And I said, "I don't want it back.
I'm happy without it." Gosh.

00:14:32.364 --> 00:14:35.331
What if you had a nose job
and you liked it?

00:14:35.355 --> 00:14:37.061
(Laughter)

00:14:37.085 --> 00:14:39.976
Would God force you
to get your old nose back?

00:14:40.824 --> 00:14:42.745
Then they gave me this Book of Mormon,

00:14:42.769 --> 00:14:44.922
told me to read
this chapter and that chapter,

00:14:44.946 --> 00:14:47.224
and said they'd come back
and check in on me,

00:14:47.248 --> 00:14:49.913
and I think I said something
like, "Please don't hurry,"

00:14:49.937 --> 00:14:52.315
or maybe just, "Please don't,"
and they were gone.

00:14:52.339 --> 00:14:54.927
Ok, so I initially felt
really superior to these boys,

00:14:54.951 --> 00:14:57.934
and smug in my more conventional faith.

00:14:58.417 --> 00:15:02.096
But then the more I thought about it,
the more I had to be honest with myself.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.423
If someone came to my door

00:15:03.447 --> 00:15:06.792
and I was hearing Catholic theology
and dogma for the very first time,

00:15:06.816 --> 00:15:10.390
and they said, "We believe that God
impregnated a very young girl

00:15:10.414 --> 00:15:11.976
without the use of intercourse,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.191
and the fact that she was a virgin
is maniacally important to us."

00:15:15.215 --> 00:15:16.517
(Laughter)

00:15:16.541 --> 00:15:19.688
"And she had a baby,
and that's the son of God,"

00:15:19.712 --> 00:15:21.976
I mean, I would think
that's equally ridiculous.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.862
I'm just so used to that story.

00:15:23.886 --> 00:15:24.976
(Laughter)

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.456
So, I couldn't let myself feel
condescending towards these boys.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:31.040
But the question they asked me
when they first arrived

00:15:31.064 --> 00:15:32.524
really stuck in my head:

00:15:32.548 --> 00:15:35.423
Did I believe that God
loved me with all his heart?

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.154
Because I wasn't exactly sure
how I felt about that question.

00:15:39.542 --> 00:15:40.817
Now, if they had asked me,

00:15:40.841 --> 00:15:44.067
"Do you feel that God loves
you with all his heart?"

00:15:44.091 --> 00:15:48.097
Well, that would have been much different,
I think I would have instantly answered,

00:15:48.121 --> 00:15:49.746
"Yes, yes, I feel it all the time.

00:15:49.770 --> 00:15:52.515
I feel God's love
when I'm hurt and confused,

00:15:52.539 --> 00:15:55.167
and I feel consoled and cared for.

00:15:55.191 --> 00:15:59.259
I take shelter in God's love when
I don't understand why tragedy hits,

00:15:59.283 --> 00:16:02.976
and I feel God's love when I look
with gratitude at all the beauty I see."

00:16:03.548 --> 00:16:06.750
But since they asked me that question
with the word "believe" in it,

00:16:06.774 --> 00:16:08.232
somehow it was all different,

00:16:08.256 --> 00:16:14.000
because I wasn't exactly sure
if I believed what I so clearly felt.
