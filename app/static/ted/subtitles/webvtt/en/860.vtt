WEBVTT

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
About a year ago,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I asked myself a question:

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
"Knowing what I know,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
why am I not a vegetarian?"

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
After all, I'm one of the green guys:

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I grew up with hippie parents in a log cabin.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I started a site called TreeHugger --

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I care about this stuff.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I knew that eating a mere hamburger a day

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
can increase my risk of dying by a third.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Cruelty: I knew that the 10 billion

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
animals we raise each year for meat

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
are raised in factory farm conditions

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
that we, hypocritically, wouldn't even consider

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
for our own cats, dogs and other pets.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Environmentally, meat, amazingly,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
causes more emissions

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
than all of transportation combined:

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
cars, trains, planes, buses, boats, all of it.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And beef production uses 100 times the water

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
that most vegetables do.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I also knew that I'm not alone.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
We as a society

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
are eating twice as much meat

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
as we did in the 50s.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
So what was once the special little side treat

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
now is the main, much more regular.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So really, any of these angles

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
should have been enough to convince me to go vegetarian.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Yet, there I was -- chk, chk, chk --

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
tucking into a big old steak.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So why was I stalling?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I realized that what I was being pitched

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
was a binary solution.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
It was either

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
you're a meat eater or you're a vegetarian,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and I guess I just wasn't quite ready.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Imagine your last hamburger.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
(Laughter)

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
So my common sense,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
my good intentions,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
were in conflict with my taste buds.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And I'd commit to doing it later,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and not surprisingly, later never came.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Sound familiar?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
So I wondered,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
might there be a third solution?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And I thought about it, and I came up with one.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
I've been doing it for the last year, and it's great.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
It's called weekday veg.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
The name says it all:

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Nothing with a face Monday through Friday.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
On the weekend, your choice.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Simple.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
If you want to take it to the next level,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
remember, the major culprits

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
in terms of environmental damage and health

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
are red and processed meats.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
So you want to swap those out

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
with some good, sustainably harvested fish.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
It's structured,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
so it ends up being simple to remember,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and it's okay to break it here and there.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
After all, cutting five days a week

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
is cutting 70 percent of your meat intake.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
The program has been great, weekday veg.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
My footprint's smaller,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
I'm lessening pollution,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
I feel better about the animals,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
I'm even saving money.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Best of all, I'm healthier,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I know that I'm going to live longer,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and I've even lost a little weight.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
So, please ask yourselves,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
for your health,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
for your pocketbook,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
for the environment, for the animals:

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
What's stopping you from giving weekday veg a shot?

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
After all, if all of us

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
ate half as much meat,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
it would be like half of us

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
were vegetarians.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Thank you.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
(Applause)
