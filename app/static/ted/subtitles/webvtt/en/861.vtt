00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I want to talk about penguins today.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
But first, I want to start by saying that

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
we need a new operating system,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
for the oceans and for the Earth.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
When I came to the Galapagos 40 years ago,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
there were 3,000 people

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
that lived in the Galapagos.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Now there are over 30,000.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
There were two Jeeps on Santa Cruz.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Now, there are around a thousand trucks

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and buses and cars there.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So the fundamental problems that we face

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
are overconsumption and too many people.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
It's the same problems in the Galapagos,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
except, obviously,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
it's worse here, in some ways, than other places.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Because we've only doubled the population of the Earth

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
since the 1960s -- a little more than doubled --

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
but we have 6.7 billion people in the world,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and we all like to consume.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And one of the major problems that we have

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
is our operating system

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
is not giving us the proper feedback.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We're not paying the true

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
environmental costs of our actions.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And when I came at age 22 to live on Fernandina,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
let me just say, that I had never

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
camped before.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I had never lived alone

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
for any period of time,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and I'd never slept with sea lions

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
snoring next to me all night.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
But moreover, I'd never lived on an uninhabited island.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Punta Espinosa is where I lived for over a year,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and we call it uninhabited

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
because there are no people there.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
But it's alive with life;

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
it's hardly uninhabited.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
So a lot has happened in the last 40 years,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and what I learned when I came to the Galapagos

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
is the importance of wild places, wild things,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
certainly wildlife,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and the amazing qualities that penguins have.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Penguins are real athletes:

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
They can swim 173 kilometers in a day.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
They can swim at the same speed day and night --

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
that's faster than any Olympic swimmer.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I mean, they can do like seven kilometers an hour

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and sustain it.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
But what is really amazing, because of this deepness here,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Emperor penguins can go down

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
more than 500 meters

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
and they can hold their breath for 23 minutes.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Magellanic penguins, the ones that I work on,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
they can dive to about 90 meters

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and they can stay down for

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
about 4.6 minutes.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Humans, without fins: 90 meters, 3.5 minutes.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
And I doubt anybody in this room

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
could really hold their breath for 3.5 minutes.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
You have to train to be able to do that.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
So penguins are amazing athletes.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
The other thing is, I've never met anybody

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
that really doesn't say that they like penguins.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
They're comical, they walk upright,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and, of course, they're diligent.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And, more importantly, they're well-dressed.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
So they have all the criteria

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
that people normally like.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
But scientifically, they're amazing because they're sentinels.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
They tell us about our world in a lot of different ways,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and particularly the ocean.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
This is a picture of a Galapagos penguin

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
that's on the front of a little zodiac here in the Galapagos.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And that's what I came to study.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
I thought I was going to study the social behavior of Galapagos penguins,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
but you already know

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
penguins are rare.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
These are the rarest penguins in the world.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Why I thought I was going to be able to do that, I don't know.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
But the population has changed

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
dramatically since I was first here.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
When I counted penguins for the first time

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
and tried to do a census,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
we just counted all the individual beaks that we could

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
around all these islands.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
We counted around 2,000, so I don't know how many penguins there really are,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
but I know I can count 2,000.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
If you go and do it now, the national parks

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
count about 500.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
So we have a quarter of the penguins

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
that we did 40 years ago.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And this is true of most of our living systems.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
We have less than we had before,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and most of them are in fairly steep decline.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And I want to just show you a little bit about why.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
(Braying)

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
That's a penguin braying

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
to tell you that

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
it's important to pay attention to penguins.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Most important of all,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
I didn't know what that was the first time I heard it.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
And you can imagine sleeping on Fernandina your first night there

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
and you hear this lonesome, plaintful call.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
I fell in love with penguins,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
and it certainly has changed the rest of my life.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
What I found out I was studying

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
is really the difference in how the Galapagos changes,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
the most extreme variation.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
You've heard about these El Ninos,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
but this is the extreme that penguins all over the world

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
have to adapt to.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
This is a cold-water event

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
called La Nina.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Where it's blue and it's green, it means the water is really cold.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
And so you can see this current coming up --

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
in this case, the Humboldt Current --

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
that comes all the way out to the Galapagos Islands,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
and this deep undersea current, the Cromwell Current,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
that upwells around the Galapagos.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
That brings all the nutrients:

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
When this is cold in the Galapagos,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
it's rich, and there's plenty of food for everyone.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
When we have extreme El Nino events,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
you see all this red,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
and you see no green

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
out here around the Galapagos.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
That means that there's no upwelling,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
and there's basically no food.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
So it's a real desert

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
for not only for the penguins and the sea lions and the marine iguanas ...

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
things die when there's no food.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
But we didn't even know that that

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
affected the Galapagos when I went to study penguins.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And you can imagine being on an island hoping you're going to see penguins,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
and you're in the middle of an El Nino event

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
and there are no penguins.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
They're not breeding; they're not even around.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
I studied marine iguanas at that point.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
But this is a global phenomenon, we know that.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And if you look along the coast of Argentina, where I work now,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
at a place called Punta Tombo --

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
the largest Magellanic penguin colony in the world

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
down here about 44 degrees south latitude --

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
you see that there's great variation here.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Some years, the cold water

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
goes all the way up to Brazil,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
and other years, in these La Nina years, it doesn't.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
So the oceans don't always act together; they act differently,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
but that is the kind of variation

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
that penguins have to live with,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
and it's not easy.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
So when I went to study the Magellanic penguins,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
I didn't have any problems.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
There were plenty of them.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
This is a picture at Punta Tombo in February

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
showing all the penguins along the beach.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
I went there because the Japanese wanted to start harvesting them

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
and turning them into high fashion golf gloves,

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
protein and oil.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Fortunately, nobody has harvested any penguins

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and we're getting over 100,000 tourists a year to see them.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
But the population is declining

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
and it's declined fairly substantially, about 21 percent

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
since 1987, when I started these surveys,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
in terms of number of active nests.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Here, you can see where Punta Tombo is,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
and they breed in incredibly dense colonies.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
We know this because of long-term science,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
because we have long-term studies there.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
And science is important in informing decision makers,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
and also in changing how we do

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
and knowing the direction of change that we're going in.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
And so we have this penguin project. The Wildlife Conservation Society

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
has funded me along with a lot of individuals

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
over the last 27 years

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
to be able to produce these kinds of maps.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And also, we know that it's not only

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Galapagos penguins that are in trouble,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
but Magellanics and many other species of penguins.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
And so we have started a global penguin society

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
to try to focus on the real plight of penguins.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
This is one of the plights of penguins: oil pollution.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Penguins don't like oil

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
and they don't like to swim through oil.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
The nice thing is, if you look down here in Argentina,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
there's no surface oil pollution from this composite map.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
But, in fact, when we went to Argentina,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
penguins were often found

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
totally covered in oil.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
So they were just minding their own business.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
They ended up swimming through ballast water that had oil in it.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Because when tankers carry oil

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
they have to have ballast at some point,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
so when they're empty, they have the ballast water in there.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
When they come back, they actually dump

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
this oily ballast water into the ocean.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Why do they do that? Because it's cheaper,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
because they don't pay the real environmental costs.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
We usually don't, and we want to start

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
getting the accounting system right

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
so we can pay the real cost.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
At first, the Argentine government said, "No, there's no way.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
You can't find oiled penguins in Argentina.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
We have laws,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
and we can't have illegal dumping; it's against the law."

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
So we ended up spending nine years

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
convincing the government that there were lots of oiled penguins.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
In some years, like this year, we found

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
more than 80 percent

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
of the adult penguins dead on the beach

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
were covered in oil.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
These little blue dots are the fledglings --

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
we do this survey every March --

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
which means that they're only in the environment

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
from January until March,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
so maybe three months at the most

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
that they could get covered in oil.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
And you can see, in some years over 60 percent

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
of the fledglings were oiled.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Eventually, the government listened

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
and, amazingly, they changed their laws.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
They moved the tanker lanes

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
40 kilometers farther off shore,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
and people are not doing as much illegal dumping.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
So what we're seeing now

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
is very few penguins are oiled.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Why are there even these penguins oiled?

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Because we've solved the problem in Chubut province,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
which is like a state in Argentina

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
where Punta Tombo is --

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
so that's about 1,000 kilometers of coastline --

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
but we haven't solved the problem

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
in northern Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
So now I want to show you that penguins are affected.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
I'm just going to talk about two things.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
This is climate change. Now this has really been a fun study

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
because I put satellite tags on the back

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
of these Magellanic penguins.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Try to convince donors to give you a couple thousand dollars

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
to glue a satellite tag on the back of penguins.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
But we've been doing this now for more than a decade to learn where they go.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
We thought we needed a marine protected area

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
of about 30 kilometers,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
and then we put a satellite tag on the back of a penguin.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
And what the penguins show us --

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
and these are all the little dots

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
from where the penguins' positions were

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
for penguins in incubation in 2003 --

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
and what you see is some of these individuals

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
are going 800 kilometers away from their nests.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
So that means as their mate

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
is sitting on the nest incubating the eggs,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
the other one is out there foraging,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
and the longer they have to stay gone,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
the worse condition the mate is in when the mate comes back.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
And, of course, all of this then leads to a vicious cycle

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
and you can't raise a lot of chicks.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Here you see in 2003 --

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
these are all the dots of where the penguins are --

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
they were raising a little over

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
a half of a chick.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Here, you can see in 2006,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
they raised almost three quarters

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
of a chick per nest,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
and you can see that they're closer to Punta Tombo;

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
they're not going as far away.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
This past year, in 2009,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
you can see that they're now raising

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
about a fourth of a chick,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
and some of these individuals are going

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
more than 900 kilometers away from their nests.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
So it's kind of like you having a job in Chicago,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
and then you get transferred

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
to St. Louis,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
and your mate is not happy about this

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
because you've got to pay airfare,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
because you're gone longer.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
The same thing's true for penguins as well.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
And they're going about, on average now,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
40 kilometers farther than they did a decade ago.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
We need to be able to get information out to the general public.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
And so we started a publication

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
with the Society for Conservation

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
that we think presents cutting-edge science

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
in a new, novel way,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
because we have reporters that are good writers

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
that actually can distill the information

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
and make it accessible to the general public.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
So if you're interested in cutting-edge science

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
and smarter conservation,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
you should join with our 11 partners --

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
some of them here in this room, like the Nature Conservancy --

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
and look at this magazine

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
because we need to get information out about conservation

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
to the general public.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Lastly I want to say that

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
all of you, probably,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
have had some relationship at some time in your life

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
with a dog, a cat, some sort of pet,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
and you recognized that those are individuals.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
And some of you consider them almost part of your family.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
If you had a relationship with a penguin,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
you'd see it in the same sort of way.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
They're amazing creatures

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
that really change how you view the world

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
because they're not that different from us:

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
They're trying to make a living,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
they're trying to raise their offspring,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
they're trying to get on and survive in the world.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
This is Turbo the Penguin.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Turbo's never been fed.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
He met us and got his name

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
because he started standing under

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
my diesel truck: a turbo truck,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
so we named him Turbo.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Turbo has taken to knocking on the door with his beak,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
we let him in and he comes in here.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
And I just wanted to show you

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
what happened one day

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
when Turbo brought in a friend.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
So this is Turbo.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
He's coming up to one of my graduate students and flipper patting,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
which he would do to a female penguin.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
And you can see, he's not trying to bite.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
This guy has never been in before

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
and he's trying to figure out, "What is going on?

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
What is this guy doing?

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
This is really pretty weird."

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
And you'll see soon

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
that my graduate student ...

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
and you see, Turbo's pretty intent

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
on his flipper patting.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
And now he's looking at the other guy,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
saying, "You are really weird."

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
And now look at this: not friendly.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
So penguins really differ in their personalities

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
just like our dogs and our cats.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
We're also trying to collect our information

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
and become more technologically literate.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
So we're trying to put that

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
in computers in the field.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
And penguins are always involved in helping us

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
or not helping us in one way or another.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
This is a radio frequency ID system.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
You put a little piece of rice in the foot of a penguin

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
that has a barcode, so it tells you who it is.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
It walks over the pad, and you know who it is.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Okay, so here are a few penguins coming in.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
See, this one's coming back to its nest.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
They're all coming in at this time,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
walking across there, just kind of leisurely coming in.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Here's a female that's in a hurry. She's got food.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
She's really rushing back, because it's hot,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
to try to feed her chicks.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
And then there's another fellow that will leisurely come by.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Look how fat he is. He's walking back to feed his chicks.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Then I realize that they're playing

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
king of the box.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
This is my box up here, and this is the system that works.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
You can see this penguin, he goes over, he looks at those wires,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
does not like that wire.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
He unplugs the wire; we have no data.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
(Laughter)

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
So, they really are pretty amazing creatures.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
OK.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Most important thing is:

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Only you can change yourself,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
and only you can change the world

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
and make it better, for people

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
as well as penguins.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
So, thank you very much. (Applause)
