00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
For the next few minutes we're going to talk about energy,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and it's going to be a bit of a varied talk.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I'll try to spin a story about energy,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and oil's a convenient starting place.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The talk will be broadly about energy,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
but oil's a good place to start.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And one of the reasons is this is remarkable stuff.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
You take about eight or so carbon atoms,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
about 20 hydrogen atoms,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
you put them together in exactly the right way

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and you get this marvelous liquid:

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
very energy-dense and very easy to refine

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
into a number of very useful products and fuels.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It's great stuff.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Now, as far as it goes,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
there's a lot of oil out there in the world.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Here's my little pocket map

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
of where it's all located.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
A bigger one for you to look at.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
But this is it, this is the oil in the world.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Geologists have a pretty good idea of where the oil is.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
This is about 100 trillion gallons

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
of crude oil

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
still to be developed and produced in the world today.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Now, that's just one story about oil,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and we could end it there and say,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
"Well, oil's going to last forever

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
because, well, there's just a lot of it."

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
But there's actually more to the story than that.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Oh, by the way, if you think you're very far from some of this oil,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
1000 meters below where you're all sitting

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
is one of the largest producing oil fields in the world.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Come talk to me about it, I'll fill in some of the details if you want.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
So, that's one of the stories of oil; there's just a lot of it.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
But what about oil? Where is it in the energy system?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Here's a little snapshot of 150 years of oil,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and it's been a dominant part of our energy system

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
for most of those 150 years.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Now, here's another little secret I'm going to tell you about:

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
For the last 25 years,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
oil has been playing less and less of a role

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
in global energy systems.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
There was one kind of peak oil in 1985,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
when oil represented 50 percent of global energy supply.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Now, it's about 35 percent.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
It's been declining

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and I believe it will continue to decline.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Gasoline consumption in the U.S. probably peaked in 2007

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and is declining.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
So oil is playing a less significant role

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
every year.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And so, 25 years ago,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
there was a peak oil;

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
just like, in the 1920s,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
there was a peak coal;

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and a hundred years before that,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
there was a peak wood.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
This is a very important picture of the evolution of energy systems.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
And what's been taking up the slack in the last few decades?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Well, a lot of natural gas

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and a little bit of nuclear, for starters.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And what goes on in the future?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Well, I think out ahead of us a few decades

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
is peak gas,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
and beyond that,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
peak renewables.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Now, I'll tell you another little, very important

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
story about this picture.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Now, I'm not pretending that energy use in total

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
isn't increasing, it is --

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
that's another part of the story. Come talk to me about it,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
we'll fill in some of the details --

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
but there's a very important message here:

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
This is 200 years of history,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and for 200 years we've been systematically decarbonizing

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
our energy system.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Energy systems of the world

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
becoming progressively -- year on year,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
decade on decade, century on century --

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
becoming less carbon intense.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And that continues into the future

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
with the renewables that we're developing today,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
reaching maybe 30 percent of primary energy

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
by mid century.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Now that might be the end of the story --

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Okay, we just replace it all with conventional renewables --

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
but I think, actually, there's more to the story than that.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
And to tell the next part of the story --

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
and this is looking out say 2100 and beyond.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
What is the future

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
of truly sustainable, carbon-free energy?

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Well, we have to take a little excursion,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
and we'll start in central Texas.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Here's a piece of limestone.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
I picked it up outside of Marble Falls, Texas.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
It's about 400 million years old.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
And it's just limestone, nothing really special about it.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Now, here's a piece of chalk.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
I picked this up at MIT. It's a little younger.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
And it's different than this limestone, you can see that.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
You wouldn't build a building out of this stuff,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and you wouldn't try to give a lecture and write on the chalkboard with this.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Yeah, it's very different -- no, it's not different.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
It's not different, it's the same stuff:

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
calcium carbonate, calcium carbonate.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
What's different is how the molecules are put together.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Now, if you think that's kind of neat,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
the story gets really neat right now.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Off the coast of California comes this:

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
It's an abalone shell.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Now, millions of abalone every year

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
make this shell.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Oh, by the way, just in case you weren't already guessing,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
it's calcium carbonate.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
It's the same stuff as this

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
and the same stuff as this.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
But it's not the same stuff; it's different.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
It's thousands of times,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
maybe 3,000 times tougher than this.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And why? Because the lowly abalone

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
is able to lay down

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
the calcium carbonate crystals in layers,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
making this beautiful, iridescent

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
mother of pearl.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Very specialized material

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
that the abalone self-assembles,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
millions of abalone,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
all the time, every day, every year.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
This is pretty incredible stuff.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
All the same, what's different?

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
How the molecules are put together.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Now, what does this have to do with energy?

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Here's a piece of coal.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
And I'll suggest that this coal

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
is about as exciting

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
as this chalk.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Now, whether we're talking about fuels

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
or energy carriers,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
or perhaps novel materials for batteries

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
or fuel cells,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
nature hasn't ever built those perfect materials yet

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
because nature didn't need to.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Nature didn't need to because, unlike the abalone shell,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
the survival of a species didn't depend

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
on building those materials,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
until maybe now when it might just matter.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
So, when we think about the future of energy,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
imagine

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
what would it be like

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
if instead of this,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
we could build the energy equivalent of this

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
just by rearranging the molecules differently.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
And so that is my story.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
The oil will never run out.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
It's not because we have a lot of it.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
It's not because we're going to build a bajillion windmills.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
It's because, well,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
thousands of years ago,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
people invented ideas --

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
they had ideas, innovations, technology --

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
and the Stone Age ended,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
not because we ran out of stones.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
(Laughter)

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
It's ideas, it's innovation, it's technology

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
that will end the age of oil, long before we run out of oil.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Thank you very much.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
(Applause)
