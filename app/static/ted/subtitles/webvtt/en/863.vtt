WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
We're here today to announce

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
the first synthetic cell,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
a cell made by

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
starting with the digital code in the computer,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
building the chromosome

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
from four bottles of chemicals,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
assembling that chromosome in yeast,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
transplanting it into

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
a recipient bacterial cell

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and transforming that cell

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
into a new bacterial species.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
So this is the first self-replicating species

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
that we've had on the planet

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
whose parent is a computer.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
It also is the first species

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
to have its own website

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
encoded in its genetic code.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
But we'll talk more about

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
the watermarks in a minute.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
This is a project that had its inception

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
15 years ago

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
when our team then --

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
we called the institute TIGR --

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
was involved in sequencing

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
the first two genomes in history.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We did Haemophilus influenzae

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and then the smallest genome of a self-replicating organism,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
that of Mycoplasma genitalium.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And as soon as

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
we had these two sequences

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
we thought, if this is supposed to be the smallest genome

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
of a self-replicating species,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
could there be even a smaller genome?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Could we understand the basis of cellular life

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
at the genetic level?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
It's been a 15-year quest

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
just to get to the starting point now

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
to be able to answer those questions,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
because it's very difficult to eliminate

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
multiple genes from a cell.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
You can only do them one at a time.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
We decided early on

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
that we had to take a synthetic route,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
even though nobody had been there before,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
to see if we could synthesize

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
a bacterial chromosome

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
so we could actually vary the gene content

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
to understand the essential genes for life.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
That started our 15-year quest

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
to get here.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
But before we did the first experiments,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
we actually asked

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Art Caplan's team at the University of Pennsylvania

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
to undertake a review

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
of what the risks, the challenges,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
the ethics around creating new

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
species in the laboratory were

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
because it hadn't been done before.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
They spent about two years

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
reviewing that independently

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and published their results in Science in 1999.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Ham and I took two years off

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
as a side project to sequence the human genome,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
but as soon as that was done

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
we got back to the task at hand.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
In 2002, we started

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
a new institute,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
the Institute for Biological Energy Alternatives,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
where we set out two goals:

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
One, to understand

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
the impact of our technology on the environment,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and how to understand the environment better,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and two, to start down this process

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
of making synthetic life

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
to understand basic life.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
In 2003,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
we published our first success.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
So Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
developed some new methods

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
for making error-free DNA

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
at a small level.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Our first task was

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
a 5,000-letter code bacteriophage,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
a virus that attacks only E. coli.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
So that was

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
the phage phi X 174,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
which was chosen for historical reasons.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
It was the first DNA phage,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
DNA virus, DNA genome

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
that was actually sequenced.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
So once we realized

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
that we could make 5,000-base pair

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
viral-sized pieces,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
we thought, we at least have the means

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
then to try and make serially lots of these pieces

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
to be able to eventually assemble them together

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
to make this mega base chromosome.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
So, substantially larger than

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
we even thought we would go initially.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
There were several steps to this. There were two sides:

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
We had to solve the chemistry

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
for making large DNA molecules,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and we had to solve the biological side

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
of how, if we had this new chemical entity,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
how would we boot it up, activate it

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
in a recipient cell.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
We had two teams working in parallel:

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
one team on the chemistry,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
and the other on trying to

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
be able to transplant

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
entire chromosomes

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
to get new cells.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
When we started this out, we thought the synthesis would be the biggest problem,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
which is why we chose the smallest genome.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
And some of you have noticed that we switched from the smallest genome

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
to a much larger one.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And we can walk through the reasons for that,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
but basically the small cell

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
took on the order of

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
one to two months to get results from,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
whereas the larger, faster-growing cell

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
takes only two days.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
So there's only so many cycles we could go through

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
in a year at six weeks per cycle.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And you should know that basically

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
99, probably 99 percent plus

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
of our experiments failed.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
So this was a debugging,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
problem-solving scenario from the beginning

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
because there was no recipe

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
of how to get there.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
So, one of the most important publications we had

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
was in 2007.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Carole Lartigue led the effort

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
to actually transplant a bacterial chromosome

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
from one bacteria to another.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
I think philosophically, that was one of the most important papers

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
that we've ever done

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
because it showed how dynamic life was.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
And we knew, once that worked,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
that we actually had a chance

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
if we could make the synthetic chromosomes

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
to do the same with those.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
We didn't know that it was going to take us

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
several years more to get there.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
In 2008,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
we reported the complete synthesis

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
of the Mycoplasma genitalium genome,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
a little over 500,000 letters of genetic code,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
but we have not yet succeeded in booting up that chromosome.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
We think in part, because of its slow growth

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
and, in part,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
cells have all kinds of unique defense mechanisms

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
to keep these events from happening.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
It turned out the cell that we were trying to transplant into

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
had a nuclease, an enzyme that chews up DNA on its surface,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
and was happy to eat

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
the synthetic DNA that we gave it

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
and never got transplantations.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
But at the time, that was the largest

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
molecule of a defined structure

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
that had been made.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
And so both sides were progressing,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
but part of the synthesis

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
had to be accomplished or was able to be accomplished

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
using yeast, putting the fragments in yeast

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
and yeast would assemble these for us.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
It's an amazing step forward,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
but we had a problem because now we had

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
the bacterial chromosomes growing in yeast.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
So in addition to doing the transplant,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
we had to find out how to get a bacterial chromosome

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
out of the eukaryotic yeast

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
into a form where we could transplant it

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
into a recipient cell.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
So our team developed new techniques

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
for actually growing, cloning

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
entire bacterial chromosomes in yeast.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
So we took the same mycoides genome

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
that Carole had initially transplanted,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
and we grew that in yeast

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
as an artificial chromosome.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
And we thought this would be a great test bed

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
for learning how to get chromosomes out of yeast

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
and transplant them.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
When we did these experiments, though,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
we could get the chromosome out of yeast

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
but it wouldn't transplant and boot up a cell.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
That little issue took the team two years to solve.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
It turns out, the DNA in the bacterial cell

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
was actually methylated,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
and the methylation protects it from the restriction enzyme,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
from digesting the DNA.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
So what we found is if we took the chromosome

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
out of yeast and methylated it,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
we could then transplant it.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Further advances came

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
when the team removed the restriction enzyme genes

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
from the recipient capricolum cell.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
And once we had done that, now we can take

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
naked DNA out of yeast and transplant it.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
So last fall

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
when we published the results of that work in Science,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
we all became overconfident

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
and were sure we were only

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
a few weeks away

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
from being able to now boot up

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
a chromosome out of yeast.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Because of the problems with

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Mycoplasma genitalium and its slow growth

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
about a year and a half ago,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
we decided to synthesize

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
the much larger chromosome, the mycoides chromosome,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
knowing that we had the biology worked out on that

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
for transplantation.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
And Dan led the team for the synthesis

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
of this over one-million-base pair chromosome.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
But it turned out it wasn't going to be as simple in the end,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
and it set us back three months

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
because we had one error

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
out of over a million base pairs in that sequence.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
So the team developed new debugging software,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
where we could test each synthetic fragment

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
to see if it would grow in a background

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
of wild type DNA.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And we found that 10 out of the 11

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
100,000-base pair pieces we synthesized

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
were completely accurate

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
and compatible with

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
a life-forming sequence.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
We narrowed it down to one fragment;

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
we sequenced it

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
and found just one base pair had been deleted

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
in an essential gene.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
So accuracy is essential.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
There's parts of the genome

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
where it cannot tolerate even a single error,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
and then there's parts of the genome

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
where we can put in large blocks of DNA,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
as we did with the watermarks,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
and it can tolerate all kinds of errors.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
So it took about three months to find that error

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
and repair it.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
And then early one morning, at 6 a.m.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
we got a text from Dan

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
saying that, now, the first blue colonies existed.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
So, it's been a long route to get here:

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
15 years from the beginning.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
We felt

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
one of the tenets of this field

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
was to make absolutely certain

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
we could distinguish synthetic DNA

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
from natural DNA.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Early on, when you're working in a new area of science,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
you have to think about all the pitfalls

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
and things that could lead you

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
to believe that you had done something when you hadn't,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
and, even worse, leading others to believe it.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
So, we thought the worst problem would be

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
a single molecule contamination

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
of the native chromosome,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
leading us to believe that we actually had

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
created a synthetic cell,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
when it would have been just a contaminant.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
So early on, we developed the notion

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
of putting in watermarks in the DNA

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
to absolutely make clear

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
that the DNA was synthetic.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
And the first chromosome we built

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
in 2008 --

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
the 500,000-base pair one --

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
we simply assigned

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
the names of the authors of the chromosome

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
into the genetic code,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
but it was using just amino acid

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
single letter translations,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
which leaves out certain letters of the alphabet.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
So the team actually developed a new code

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
within the code within the code.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
So it's a new code

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
for interpreting and writing messages in DNA.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Now, mathematicians have been hiding and writing

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
messages in the genetic code for a long time,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
but it's clear they were mathematicians and not biologists

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
because, if you write long messages

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
with the code that the mathematicians developed,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
it would more than likely lead to

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
new proteins being synthesized

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
with unknown functions.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
So the code that Mike Montague and the team developed

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
actually puts frequent stop codons,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
so it's a different alphabet

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
but allows us to use

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
the entire English alphabet

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
with punctuation and numbers.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
So, there are four major watermarks

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
all over 1,000 base pairs of genetic code.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
The first one actually contains within it

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
this code for interpreting

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
the rest of the genetic code.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
So in the remaining information,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
in the watermarks,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
contain the names of, I think it's

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
46 different authors

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
and key contributors

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
to getting the project to this stage.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
And we also built in

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
a website address

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
so that if somebody decodes the code

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
within the code within the code,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
they can send an email to that address.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
So it's clearly distinguishable

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
from any other species,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
having 46 names in it,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
its own web address.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
And we added three quotations,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
because with the first genome

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
we were criticized for not trying to say something more profound

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
than just signing the work.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
So we won't give the rest of the code,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
but we will give the three quotations.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
The first is,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
"To live, to err,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
to fall, to triumph

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
and to recreate life out of life."

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
It's a James Joyce quote.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
The second quotation is, "See things not as they are,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
but as they might be."

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
It's a quote from the "American Prometheus"

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
book on Robert Oppenheimer.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
And the last one is a Richard Feynman quote:

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
"What I cannot build,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
I cannot understand."

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
So, because this is as much a philosophical advance

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
as a technical advance in science,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
we tried to deal with both the philosophical

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
and the technical side.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
The last thing I want to say before turning it over to questions

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
is that the extensive work

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
that we've done --

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
asking for ethical review,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
pushing the envelope

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
on that side as well as the technical side --

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
this has been broadly discussed in the scientific community,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
in the policy community

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
and at the highest levels of the federal government.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Even with this announcement,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
as we did in 2003 --

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
that work was funded by the Department of Energy,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
so the work was reviewed

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
at the level of the White House,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
trying to decide whether to classify the work or publish it.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
And they came down on the side of open publication,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
which is the right approach --

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
we've briefed the White House,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
we've briefed members of Congress,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
we've tried to take and push

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
the policy issues

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
in parallel with the scientific advances.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
So with that, I would like

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
to open it first to the floor for questions.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Yes, in the back.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Reporter: Could you explain, in layman's terms,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
how significant a breakthrough this is please?

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Craig Venter: Can we explain how significant this is?

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
I'm not sure we're the ones that should be explaining how significant it is.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
It's significant to us.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Perhaps it's a giant philosophical change

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
in how we view life.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
We actually view it as a baby step in terms of,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
it's taken us 15 years to be able

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
to do the experiment

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
we wanted to do 15 years ago

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
on understanding life at its basic level.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
But we actually believe

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
this is going to be a very powerful set of tools

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
and we're already starting

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
in numerous avenues

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
to use this tool.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
We have, at the Institute,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
ongoing funding now from NIH

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
in a program with Novartis

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
to try and use these new

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
synthetic DNA tools

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
to perhaps make the flu vaccine

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
that you might get next year.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Because instead of taking weeks to months to make these,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Dan's team can now make these

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
in less than 24 hours.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
So when you see how long it took to get an H1N1 vaccine out,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
we think we can shorten that process

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
quite substantially.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
In the vaccine area,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Synthetic Genomics and the Institute

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
are forming a new vaccine company

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
because we think these tools can affect vaccines

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
to diseases that haven't been possible to date,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
things where the viruses rapidly evolve,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
such with rhinovirus.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Wouldn't it be nice to have something that actually blocked common colds?

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Or, more importantly, HIV,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
where the virus evolves so quickly

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
the vaccines that are made today

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
can't keep up

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
with those evolutionary changes.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Also, at Synthetic Genomics,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
we've been working

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
on major environmental issues.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
I think this latest oil spill in the Gulf

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
is a reminder.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
We can't see CO2 --

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
we depend on scientific measurements for it

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
and we see the beginning results

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
of having too much of it --

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
but we can see pre-CO2 now

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
floating on the waters

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
and contaminating the beaches in the Gulf.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
We need some alternatives

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
for oil.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
We have a program with Exxon Mobile

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
to try and develop new strains of algae

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
that can efficiently capture carbon dioxide

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
from the atmosphere or from concentrated sources,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
make new hydrocarbons that can go into their refineries

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
to make normal gasoline

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
and diesel fuel out of CO2.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
Those are just a couple of the approaches

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
and directions that we're taking.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
