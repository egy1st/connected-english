WEBVTT

00:00:01.658 --> 00:00:03.158
I was here four years ago,

00:00:03.182 --> 00:00:04.976
and I remember, at the time,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.519
that the talks weren't put online.

00:00:08.543 --> 00:00:11.976
I think they were given
to TEDsters in a box,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.851
a box set of DVDs,

00:00:13.875 --> 00:00:16.367
which they put on their shelves,
where they are now.

00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:18.367
(Laughter)

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:22.977
And actually, Chris called me
a week after I'd given my talk, and said,

00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:26.205
"We're going to start putting them online.
Can we put yours online?"

00:00:26.229 --> 00:00:28.109
And I said, "Sure."

00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:30.712
And four years later,

00:00:30.736 --> 00:00:34.976
it's been downloaded four million times.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.712
So I suppose you could multiply that
by 20 or something

00:00:38.736 --> 00:00:40.784
to get the number
of people who've seen it.

00:00:40.808 --> 00:00:44.912
And, as Chris says, there is
a hunger for videos of me.

00:00:45.365 --> 00:00:48.009
(Laughter)

00:00:48.033 --> 00:00:51.033
(Applause)

00:00:54.076 --> 00:00:55.078
Don't you feel?

00:00:55.102 --> 00:00:58.020
(Laughter)

00:00:59.857 --> 00:01:03.601
So, this whole event
has been an elaborate build-up

00:01:03.625 --> 00:01:06.264
to me doing another one
for you, so here it is.

00:01:06.288 --> 00:01:07.775
(Laughter)

00:01:09.301 --> 00:01:14.976
Al Gore spoke at the TED conference
I spoke at four years ago

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.702
and talked about the climate crisis.

00:01:17.726 --> 00:01:20.797
And I referenced that
at the end of my last talk.

00:01:21.408 --> 00:01:22.976
So I want to pick up from there

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.050
because I only had 18 minutes, frankly.

00:01:25.074 --> 00:01:26.106
(Laughter)

00:01:26.636 --> 00:01:27.976
So, as I was saying --

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
(Laughter)

00:01:37.291 --> 00:01:38.322
You see, he's right.

00:01:38.346 --> 00:01:40.976
I mean, there is a major
climate crisis, obviously,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.096
and I think if people don't believe it,
they should get out more.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.296
(Laughter)

00:01:47.828 --> 00:01:51.343
But I believe there is
a second climate crisis,

00:01:51.367 --> 00:01:53.542
which is as severe,

00:01:53.566 --> 00:01:55.976
which has the same origins,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.422
and that we have to deal with
with the same urgency.

00:02:00.034 --> 00:02:02.202
And you may say, by the way,

00:02:02.226 --> 00:02:03.910
"Look, I'm good.

00:02:03.934 --> 00:02:07.116
I have one climate crisis,
I don't really need the second one."

00:02:07.424 --> 00:02:08.441
(Laughter)

00:02:08.465 --> 00:02:10.838
But this is a crisis of,
not natural resources --

00:02:10.862 --> 00:02:12.784
though I believe that's true --

00:02:12.808 --> 00:02:15.008
but a crisis of human resources.

00:02:15.643 --> 00:02:16.976
I believe fundamentally,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.770
as many speakers have said
during the past few days,

00:02:19.794 --> 00:02:24.240
that we make very poor use of our talents.

00:02:24.904 --> 00:02:27.000
Very many people go
through their whole lives

00:02:27.024 --> 00:02:29.976
having no real sense
of what their talents may be,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.976
or if they have any to speak of.

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:34.110
I meet all kinds of people

00:02:34.134 --> 00:02:36.698
who don't think
they're really good at anything.

00:02:37.253 --> 00:02:41.125
Actually, I kind of divide the world
into two groups now.

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:44.553
Jeremy Bentham, the great
utilitarian philosopher,

00:02:44.577 --> 00:02:45.976
once spiked this argument.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.664
He said, "There are two types
of people in this world:

00:02:48.688 --> 00:02:50.648
those who divide the world into two types

00:02:50.672 --> 00:02:51.848
and those who do not."

00:02:51.872 --> 00:02:54.872
(Laughter)

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.729
Well, I do.

00:02:58.753 --> 00:03:00.753
(Laughter)

00:03:04.482 --> 00:03:09.442
I meet all kinds of people
who don't enjoy what they do.

00:03:09.466 --> 00:03:12.259
They simply go through their lives
getting on with it.

00:03:12.713 --> 00:03:15.142
They get no great pleasure
from what they do.

00:03:15.166 --> 00:03:18.639
They endure it rather than enjoy it,

00:03:18.663 --> 00:03:20.106
and wait for the weekend.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.895
But I also meet people

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:26.976
who love what they do
and couldn't imagine doing anything else.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.807
If you said, "Don't do this anymore,"

00:03:28.831 --> 00:03:30.828
they'd wonder what you're talking about.

00:03:30.852 --> 00:03:32.928
It isn't what they do, it's who they are.

00:03:32.952 --> 00:03:34.893
They say, "But this is me, you know.

00:03:34.917 --> 00:03:36.822
It would be foolish to abandon this,

00:03:36.846 --> 00:03:38.948
because it speaks
to my most authentic self."

00:03:39.453 --> 00:03:42.103
And it's not true of enough people.

00:03:42.587 --> 00:03:46.071
In fact, on the contrary, I think
it's still true of a minority of people.

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:49.976
And I think there are many
possible explanations for it.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.387
And high among them is education,

00:03:54.411 --> 00:03:56.785
because education, in a way,

00:03:56.809 --> 00:04:00.332
dislocates very many people
from their natural talents.

00:04:00.872 --> 00:04:03.745
And human resources
are like natural resources;

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:05.111
they're often buried deep.

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:07.271
You have to go looking for them,

00:04:07.295 --> 00:04:09.462
they're not just lying around
on the surface.

00:04:09.486 --> 00:04:12.690
You have to create the circumstances
where they show themselves.

00:04:12.714 --> 00:04:16.214
And you might imagine
education would be the way that happens,

00:04:16.238 --> 00:04:17.738
but too often, it's not.

00:04:18.555 --> 00:04:22.313
Every education system in the world
is being reformed at the moment

00:04:22.337 --> 00:04:23.610
and it's not enough.

00:04:24.046 --> 00:04:26.744
Reform is no use anymore,

00:04:26.768 --> 00:04:29.395
because that's simply improving
a broken model.

00:04:30.133 --> 00:04:31.180
What we need --

00:04:31.204 --> 00:04:33.973
and the word's been used
many times in the past few days --

00:04:33.997 --> 00:04:35.751
is not evolution,

00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:38.378
but a revolution in education.

00:04:38.767 --> 00:04:41.976
This has to be transformed
into something else.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.022
(Applause)

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.305
One of the real challenges
is to innovate fundamentally in education.

00:04:54.106 --> 00:04:56.217
Innovation is hard,

00:04:56.241 --> 00:04:59.437
because it means doing something
that people don't find very easy,

00:04:59.461 --> 00:05:00.823
for the most part.

00:05:00.847 --> 00:05:03.255
It means challenging
what we take for granted,

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:05.271
things that we think are obvious.

00:05:05.895 --> 00:05:09.976
The great problem for reform
or transformation

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.015
is the tyranny of common sense.

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:14.194
Things that people think,

00:05:14.218 --> 00:05:16.747
"It can't be done differently,
that's how it's done."

00:05:16.771 --> 00:05:19.588
I came across a great quote recently
from Abraham Lincoln,

00:05:19.612 --> 00:05:22.453
who I thought you'd be pleased
to have quoted at this point.

00:05:22.477 --> 00:05:24.222
(Laughter)

00:05:24.246 --> 00:05:30.507
He said this in December 1862
to the second annual meeting of Congress.

00:05:31.198 --> 00:05:34.507
I ought to explain that I have no idea
what was happening at the time.

00:05:35.952 --> 00:05:38.705
We don't teach
American history in Britain.

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:40.642
(Laughter)

00:05:40.666 --> 00:05:42.976
We suppress it.
You know, this is our policy.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.304
(Laughter)

00:05:46.137 --> 00:05:48.708
No doubt, something fascinating
was happening then,

00:05:48.732 --> 00:05:51.442
which the Americans among us
will be aware of.

00:05:53.347 --> 00:05:54.354
But he said this:

00:05:55.656 --> 00:06:01.801
"The dogmas of the quiet past
are inadequate to the stormy present.

00:06:02.761 --> 00:06:06.579
The occasion
is piled high with difficulty,

00:06:06.603 --> 00:06:09.981
and we must rise with the occasion."

00:06:10.552 --> 00:06:11.583
I love that.

00:06:11.607 --> 00:06:13.623
Not rise to it, rise with it.

00:06:15.203 --> 00:06:17.192
"As our case is new,

00:06:17.216 --> 00:06:22.296
so we must think anew and act anew.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.976
We must disenthrall ourselves,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.965
and then we shall save our country."

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.315
I love that word, "disenthrall."

00:06:31.711 --> 00:06:32.816
You know what it means?

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.976
That there are ideas
that all of us are enthralled to,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.033
which we simply take for granted
as the natural order of things,

00:06:39.057 --> 00:06:40.429
the way things are.

00:06:40.453 --> 00:06:43.103
And many of our ideas have been formed,

00:06:43.127 --> 00:06:45.365
not to meet the circumstances
of this century,

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:48.056
but to cope with the circumstances
of previous centuries.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.253
But our minds
are still hypnotized by them,

00:06:50.277 --> 00:06:52.976
and we have to disenthrall ourselves
of some of them.

00:06:53.523 --> 00:06:55.928
Now, doing this is easier said than done.

00:06:55.952 --> 00:06:59.165
It's very hard to know, by the way,
what it is you take for granted.

00:06:59.689 --> 00:07:01.984
And the reason
is that you take it for granted.

00:07:02.008 --> 00:07:03.010
(Laughter)

00:07:03.034 --> 00:07:05.368
Let me ask you something
you may take for granted.

00:07:05.392 --> 00:07:07.561
How many of you here
are over the age of 25?

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.122
That's not what you take for granted,
I'm sure you're familiar with that.

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:14.976
Are there any people here
under the age of 25?

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:17.976
Great. Now, those over 25,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.976
could you put your hands up
if you're wearing your wristwatch?

00:07:21.795 --> 00:07:23.976
Now that's a great deal of us, isn't it?

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.993
Ask a room full of teenagers
the same thing.

00:07:27.572 --> 00:07:29.635
Teenagers do not wear wristwatches.

00:07:29.659 --> 00:07:31.573
I don't mean they can't,

00:07:31.597 --> 00:07:33.048
they just often choose not to.

00:07:33.445 --> 00:07:37.041
And the reason is we were brought up
in a pre-digital culture,

00:07:37.065 --> 00:07:38.276
those of us over 25.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.449
And so for us,
if you want to know the time,

00:07:40.473 --> 00:07:42.419
you have to wear something to tell it.

00:07:42.443 --> 00:07:45.142
Kids now live in a world
which is digitized,

00:07:45.166 --> 00:07:46.976
and the time, for them, is everywhere.

00:07:47.277 --> 00:07:48.718
They see no reason to do this.

00:07:49.146 --> 00:07:50.991
And by the way, you don't need either;

00:07:51.015 --> 00:07:53.984
it's just that you've always done it
and you carry on doing it.

00:07:54.008 --> 00:07:57.253
My daughter never wears a watch,
my daughter Kate, who's 20.

00:07:57.277 --> 00:07:58.670
She doesn't see the point.

00:07:58.694 --> 00:08:00.481
As she says,

00:08:00.505 --> 00:08:02.376
"It's a single-function device."

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:07.528
(Laughter)

00:08:07.552 --> 00:08:09.219
"Like, how lame is that?"

00:08:09.896 --> 00:08:12.136
And I say, "No, no,
it tells the date as well."

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:16.160
(Laughter)

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.603
"It has multiple functions."

00:08:18.627 --> 00:08:19.976
(Laughter)

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.452
But, you see, there are things
we're enthralled to in education.

00:08:24.033 --> 00:08:25.388
A couple of examples.

00:08:25.412 --> 00:08:28.135
One of them is the idea of linearity:

00:08:28.159 --> 00:08:30.795
that it starts here
and you go through a track

00:08:30.819 --> 00:08:32.342
and if you do everything right,

00:08:32.366 --> 00:08:34.993
you will end up set
for the rest of your life.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.524
Everybody who's spoken at TED
has told us implicitly,

00:08:39.548 --> 00:08:42.224
or sometimes explicitly,
a different story:

00:08:42.248 --> 00:08:44.976
that life is not linear; it's organic.

00:08:45.478 --> 00:08:47.470
We create our lives symbiotically

00:08:47.494 --> 00:08:49.343
as we explore our talents

00:08:49.367 --> 00:08:52.207
in relation to the circumstances
they help to create for us.

00:08:52.596 --> 00:08:55.976
But, you know, we have become obsessed
with this linear narrative.

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:59.700
And probably the pinnacle for education
is getting you to college.

00:09:00.216 --> 00:09:02.976
I think we are obsessed
with getting people to college.

00:09:03.422 --> 00:09:04.701
Certain sorts of college.

00:09:04.725 --> 00:09:07.629
I don't mean you shouldn't go,
but not everybody needs to go,

00:09:07.653 --> 00:09:08.846
or go now.

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:11.502
Maybe they go later, not right away.

00:09:11.526 --> 00:09:14.654
And I was up in San Francisco
a while ago doing a book signing.

00:09:14.678 --> 00:09:17.477
There was this guy buying a book,
he was in his 30s.

00:09:17.501 --> 00:09:18.771
I said, "What do you do?"

00:09:18.795 --> 00:09:20.779
And he said, "I'm a fireman."

00:09:21.881 --> 00:09:23.976
I asked, "How long
have you been a fireman?"

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.317
"Always. I've always been a fireman."

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:29.307
"Well, when did you decide?"
He said, "As a kid.

00:09:29.331 --> 00:09:31.427
Actually, it was
a problem for me at school,

00:09:31.451 --> 00:09:33.977
because at school,
everybody wanted to be a fireman."

00:09:34.001 --> 00:09:35.015
(Laughter)

00:09:35.039 --> 00:09:36.976
He said, "But I wanted to be a fireman."

00:09:37.752 --> 00:09:40.541
And he said, "When I got
to the senior year of school,

00:09:40.565 --> 00:09:42.976
my teachers didn't take it seriously.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.252
This one teacher didn't take it seriously.

00:09:45.276 --> 00:09:47.323
He said I was throwing my life away

00:09:47.347 --> 00:09:49.363
if that's all I chose to do with it;

00:09:49.387 --> 00:09:52.693
that I should go to college, I should
become a professional person,

00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:53.976
that I had great potential

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.130
and I was wasting my talent to do that."

00:09:56.154 --> 00:09:57.568
He said, "It was humiliating.

00:09:57.592 --> 00:10:00.178
It was in front of the whole class
and I felt dreadful.

00:10:00.202 --> 00:10:02.709
But it's what I wanted,
and as soon as I left school,

00:10:02.733 --> 00:10:05.031
I applied to the fire service
and I was accepted.

00:10:05.055 --> 00:10:07.341
You know, I was thinking
about that guy recently,

00:10:07.365 --> 00:10:10.556
just a few minutes ago when you
were speaking, about this teacher,

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:13.414
because six months ago, I saved his life."

00:10:13.833 --> 00:10:17.045
(Laughter)

00:10:17.069 --> 00:10:21.428
He said, "He was in a car wreck,
and I pulled him out, gave him CPR,

00:10:21.452 --> 00:10:23.301
and I saved his wife's life as well."

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.191
He said, "I think he thinks
better of me now."

00:10:26.215 --> 00:10:27.976
(Laughter)

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.810
(Applause)

00:10:34.532 --> 00:10:35.731
You know, to me,

00:10:35.755 --> 00:10:39.976
human communities depend
upon a diversity of talent,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.456
not a singular conception of ability.

00:10:42.928 --> 00:10:44.905
And at the heart of our challenges --

00:10:44.929 --> 00:10:47.570
(Applause)

00:10:47.594 --> 00:10:48.976
At the heart of the challenge

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.971
is to reconstitute our sense of ability
and of intelligence.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:55.703
This linearity thing is a problem.

00:10:56.154 --> 00:10:58.976
When I arrived in L.A.
about nine years ago,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.129
I came across a policy statement --

00:11:03.153 --> 00:11:04.416
very well-intentioned --

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.898
which said, "College
begins in kindergarten."

00:11:08.864 --> 00:11:10.054
No, it doesn't.

00:11:10.078 --> 00:11:13.809
(Laughter)

00:11:14.571 --> 00:11:15.631
It doesn't.

00:11:16.373 --> 00:11:18.826
If we had time,
I could go into this, but we don't.

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:21.064
(Laughter)

00:11:21.088 --> 00:11:23.564
Kindergarten begins in kindergarten.

00:11:23.588 --> 00:11:25.898
(Laughter)

00:11:25.922 --> 00:11:27.675
A friend of mine once said,

00:11:27.699 --> 00:11:30.136
"A three year-old
is not half a six year-old."

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.976
(Laughter)

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.529
(Applause)

00:11:37.553 --> 00:11:38.665
They're three.

00:11:38.689 --> 00:11:40.689
But as we just heard in this last session,

00:11:40.713 --> 00:11:43.976
there's such competition now
to get into kindergarten --

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.859
to get to the right kindergarten --

00:11:45.883 --> 00:11:49.715
that people are being interviewed
for it at three.

00:11:51.839 --> 00:11:53.913
Kids sitting in front
of unimpressed panels,

00:11:53.937 --> 00:11:55.414
you know, with their resumes --

00:11:55.438 --> 00:11:58.029
(Laughter)

00:11:58.053 --> 00:12:00.327
Flicking through and saying,
"What, this is it?"

00:12:00.351 --> 00:12:01.976
(Laughter)

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.319
(Applause)

00:12:05.343 --> 00:12:08.299
"You've been around
for 36 months, and this is it?"

00:12:08.323 --> 00:12:15.376
(Laughter)

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.154
"You've achieved nothing -- commit.

00:12:17.178 --> 00:12:18.564
(Laughter)

00:12:18.588 --> 00:12:21.389
Spent the first six months
breastfeeding, I can see."

00:12:21.413 --> 00:12:24.072
(Laughter)

00:12:26.532 --> 00:12:29.119
See, it's outrageous as a conception.

00:12:29.143 --> 00:12:31.333
The other big issue is conformity.

00:12:31.357 --> 00:12:34.976
We have built our education systems
on the model of fast food.

00:12:35.615 --> 00:12:38.488
This is something Jamie Oliver
talked about the other day.

00:12:38.512 --> 00:12:41.059
There are two models
of quality assurance in catering.

00:12:41.083 --> 00:12:43.723
One is fast food,
where everything is standardized.

00:12:43.747 --> 00:12:46.062
The other is like Zagat
and Michelin restaurants,

00:12:46.086 --> 00:12:47.849
where everything is not standardized,

00:12:47.873 --> 00:12:49.898
they're customized to local circumstances.

00:12:49.922 --> 00:12:53.299
And we have sold ourselves
into a fast-food model of education,

00:12:53.323 --> 00:12:56.398
and it's impoverishing
our spirit and our energies

00:12:56.422 --> 00:12:59.243
as much as fast food is depleting
our physical bodies.

00:12:59.809 --> 00:13:05.120
(Applause)

00:13:05.889 --> 00:13:08.004
We have to recognize
a couple of things here.

00:13:08.028 --> 00:13:10.376
One is that human talent
is tremendously diverse.

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.203
People have very different aptitudes.

00:13:12.227 --> 00:13:15.976
I worked out recently
that I was given a guitar as a kid

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.976
at about the same time
that Eric Clapton got his first guitar.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.604
(Laughter)

00:13:20.628 --> 00:13:22.860
It worked out for Eric,
that's all I'm saying.

00:13:22.884 --> 00:13:23.906
(Laughter)

00:13:23.930 --> 00:13:25.017
In a way --

00:13:26.145 --> 00:13:27.412
it did not for me.

00:13:27.436 --> 00:13:29.977
I could not get this thing to work

00:13:30.001 --> 00:13:32.533
no matter how often
or how hard I blew into it.

00:13:32.557 --> 00:13:34.264
It just wouldn't work.

00:13:34.288 --> 00:13:35.612
(Laughter)

00:13:37.898 --> 00:13:39.279
But it's not only about that.

00:13:39.303 --> 00:13:40.461
It's about passion.

00:13:41.151 --> 00:13:44.058
Often, people are good at things
they don't really care for.

00:13:44.082 --> 00:13:45.276
It's about passion,

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:47.976
and what excites
our spirit and our energy.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.381
And if you're doing the thing
that you love to do, that you're good at,

00:13:51.405 --> 00:13:53.675
time takes a different course entirely.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:56.297
My wife's just finished writing a novel,

00:13:56.321 --> 00:13:59.352
and I think it's a great book,

00:13:59.376 --> 00:14:01.976
but she disappears for hours on end.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.381
You know this, if you're doing
something you love,

00:14:04.405 --> 00:14:06.290
an hour feels like five minutes.

00:14:06.943 --> 00:14:09.991
If you're doing something
that doesn't resonate with your spirit,

00:14:10.015 --> 00:14:11.606
five minutes feels like an hour.

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:14.314
And the reason so many people
are opting out of education

00:14:14.338 --> 00:14:16.655
is because it doesn't feed their spirit,

00:14:16.679 --> 00:14:19.457
it doesn't feed their energy
or their passion.

00:14:19.774 --> 00:14:21.764
So I think we have to change metaphors.

00:14:22.303 --> 00:14:25.834
We have to go from what is essentially
an industrial model of education,

00:14:25.858 --> 00:14:27.659
a manufacturing model,

00:14:27.683 --> 00:14:32.046
which is based on linearity
and conformity and batching people.

00:14:32.468 --> 00:14:34.373
We have to move to a model

00:14:34.397 --> 00:14:36.976
that is based more
on principles of agriculture.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.263
We have to recognize

00:14:38.287 --> 00:14:42.214
that human flourishing
is not a mechanical process;

00:14:42.238 --> 00:14:44.167
it's an organic process.

00:14:44.191 --> 00:14:47.777
And you cannot predict
the outcome of human development.

00:14:47.801 --> 00:14:50.494
All you can do, like a farmer,
is create the conditions

00:14:50.518 --> 00:14:52.691
under which they will begin to flourish.

00:14:53.279 --> 00:14:56.540
So when we look at reforming
education and transforming it,

00:14:56.564 --> 00:14:58.822
it isn't like cloning a system.

00:14:58.846 --> 00:15:01.418
There are great ones,
like KIPP's; it's a great system.

00:15:01.442 --> 00:15:03.281
There are many great models.

00:15:03.305 --> 00:15:06.527
It's about customizing
to your circumstances

00:15:06.551 --> 00:15:09.976
and personalizing education
to the people you're actually teaching.

00:15:10.628 --> 00:15:13.701
And doing that, I think,
is the answer to the future

00:15:13.725 --> 00:15:17.140
because it's not
about scaling a new solution;

00:15:17.164 --> 00:15:19.481
it's about creating
a movement in education

00:15:19.505 --> 00:15:21.976
in which people develop
their own solutions,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.285
but with external support
based on a personalized curriculum.

00:15:25.309 --> 00:15:26.976
Now in this room,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.976
there are people who represent
extraordinary resources in business,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.292
in multimedia, in the Internet.

00:15:33.316 --> 00:15:34.976
These technologies,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.766
combined with the extraordinary
talents of teachers,

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:41.643
provide an opportunity
to revolutionize education.

00:15:41.667 --> 00:15:43.762
And I urge you to get involved in it

00:15:43.786 --> 00:15:47.406
because it's vital, not just to ourselves,
but to the future of our children.

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:49.833
But we have to change
from the industrial model

00:15:49.857 --> 00:15:51.508
to an agricultural model,

00:15:51.532 --> 00:15:54.556
where each school can be
flourishing tomorrow.

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:56.428
That's where children experience life.

00:15:56.452 --> 00:15:58.318
Or at home, if that's what they choose,

00:15:58.342 --> 00:16:00.555
to be educated
with their families or friends.

00:16:00.579 --> 00:16:04.730
There's been a lot of talk about dreams
over the course of these few days.

00:16:05.214 --> 00:16:07.240
And I wanted to just very quickly --

00:16:07.264 --> 00:16:10.169
I was very struck
by Natalie Merchant's songs last night,

00:16:10.193 --> 00:16:11.478
recovering old poems.

00:16:12.208 --> 00:16:14.344
I wanted to read you
a quick, very short poem

00:16:14.368 --> 00:16:16.458
from W. B. Yeats,
who some of you may know.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.869
He wrote this to his love, Maud Gonne,

00:16:20.893 --> 00:16:23.774
and he was bewailing the fact

00:16:23.798 --> 00:16:27.048
that he couldn't really give her
what he thought she wanted from him.

00:16:27.072 --> 00:16:30.468
And he says, "I've got something else,
but it may not be for you."

00:16:30.492 --> 00:16:31.634
He says this:

00:16:32.508 --> 00:16:35.380
"Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths,

00:16:35.404 --> 00:16:38.277
Enwrought with gold and silver light,

00:16:39.372 --> 00:16:42.809
The blue and the dim and the dark cloths

00:16:42.833 --> 00:16:45.760
Of night and light and the half-light,

00:16:46.902 --> 00:16:49.047
I would spread the cloths under your feet:

00:16:50.054 --> 00:16:54.028
But I, being poor, have only my dreams;

00:16:54.896 --> 00:16:57.480
I have spread my dreams under your feet;

00:16:58.749 --> 00:16:59.757
Tread softly

00:17:00.401 --> 00:17:02.161
because you tread on my dreams."

00:17:02.857 --> 00:17:05.641
And every day, everywhere,

00:17:05.665 --> 00:17:08.854
our children spread
their dreams beneath our feet.

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.024
And we should tread softly.

00:17:12.189 --> 00:17:13.262
Thank you.

00:17:13.286 --> 00:17:16.920
(Applause)

00:17:16.944 --> 00:17:18.323
Thank you very much.

00:17:18.347 --> 00:17:22.365
(Applause)

00:17:22.389 --> 00:17:23.404
Thank you.

00:17:23.428 --> 00:17:26.428
(Applause)
