00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I heard this amazing story about Miuccia Prada.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
She's an Italian fashion designer.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
She goes to this vintage store in Paris

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
with a friend of hers.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
She's rooting around, she finds this one jacket by Balenciaga --

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
she loves it.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
She's turning it inside out.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
She's looking at the seams. She's looking at the construction.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Her friend says, "Buy it already."

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
She said, "I'll buy it, but I'm also going to replicate it."

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Now, the academics in this audience may think,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
"Well, that sounds like plagiarism."

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
But to a fashionista, what it really is

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
is a sign of Prada's genius:

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
that she can root through the history of fashion

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and pick the one jacket

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
that doesn't need to be changed by one iota,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and to be current and to be now.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
You might also be asking whether it's possible

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
that this is illegal for her to do this.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Well, it turns out that it's actually not illegal.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
In the fashion industry, there's very little

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
intellectual property protection.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
They have trademark protection,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
but no copyright protection

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and no patent protection to speak of.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
All they have, really, is trademark protection,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and so it means that anybody

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
could copy any garment

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
on any person in this room

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and sell it as their own design.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The only thing that they can't copy

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
is the actual trademark label

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
within that piece of apparel.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
That's one reason that you see logos

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
splattered all over these products.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
It's because it's a lot harder for knock-off artists

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
to knock off these designs

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
because they can't knock off the logo.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
But if you go to Santee Alley, yeah.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
(Laughter) Well, yeah.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Canal Street, I know.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And sometimes these are fun, right?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Now, the reason for this, the reason that the fashion industry

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
doesn't have any copyright protection

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
is because the courts decided long ago

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
that apparel is too utilitarian

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
to qualify for copyright protection.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
They didn't want a handful of designers

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
owning the seminal building blocks of our clothing.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And then everybody else would have to license this cuff or this sleeve

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
because Joe Blow owns it.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
But too utilitarian? I mean is that the way you think of fashion?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
This is Vivienne Westwood. No!

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
We think of it as maybe too silly,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
too unnecessary.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Now, those of you who are familiar with the logic

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
behind copyright protection --

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
which is that without ownership, there is no incentive to innovate --

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
might be really surprised

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
by both the critical success of the fashion industry

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and the economic success of this industry.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
What I'm going to argue today is that

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
because there's no copyright protection

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
in the fashion industry,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
fashion designers have actually been able to elevate

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
utilitarian design,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
things to cover our naked bodies,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
into something that we consider art.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Because there's no copyright protection

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
in this industry,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
there's a very open and creative

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
ecology of creativity.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Unlike their creative brothers and sisters,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
who are sculptors or photographers

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
or filmmakers or musicians,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
fashion designers can sample

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
from all their peers' designs.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
They can take any element from any garment

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
from the history of fashion

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
and incorporate it into their own design.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
They're also notorious for riffing off of the zeitgeist.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And here, I suspect,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
they were influenced by the costumes in Avatar.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Maybe just a little.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Can't copyright a costume either.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Now, fashion designers have

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
the broadest palette imaginable

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
in this creative industry.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
This wedding dress here

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
is actually made of sporks,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
and this dress is actually made of aluminum.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
I've heard this dress actually sort of sounds like wind chimes

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
as they walk through.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
So, one of the magical side effects

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
of having a culture of copying,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
which is really what it is,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
is the establishment of trends.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
People think this is a magical thing. How does it happen?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Well, it's because it's legal for people to copy one another.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Some people believe that

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
there are a few people at the top of the fashion food chain

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
who sort of dictate to us what we're all going to wear,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
but if you talk to any designer at any level,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
including these high-end designers,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
they always say

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
their main inspiration comes from the street:

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
where people like you and me remix and match

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
our own fashion looks.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And that's where they really get a lot of their

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
creative inspiration,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
so it's both a top-down and a bottom-up kind of industry.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Now, the fast fashion giants have

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
probably benefited the most

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
from the lack of copyright protection in the fashion industry.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
They are notorious for knocking off high-end designs

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
and selling them at very low prices.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
And they've been faced with a lot of lawsuits,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
but those lawsuits are usually not won by fashion designers.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
The courts have said over and over again, "You don't need

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
any more intellectual property protection."

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
When you look at copies like this,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
you wonder: How do the luxury high-end brands

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
remain in business?

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
If you can get it for 200 bucks, why pay a thousand?

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Well, that's one reason we had a conference here at USC a few years ago.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
We invited Tom Ford to come --

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
the conference was called, "Ready to Share:

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Fashion and the Ownership of Creativity" --

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and we asked him exactly this question.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Here's what he had to say.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
He had just come off a successful stint as the lead designer at Gucci,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
in case you didn't know.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Tom Ford: And we found after much research

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
that -- actually not much research, quite simple research --

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
that the counterfeit customer was not our customer.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Johanna Blakley: Imagine that.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
The people on Santee Alley

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
are not the ones who shop at Gucci.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
(Laughter)

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
This is a very different demographic.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And, you know, a knock-off is never the same

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
as an original high-end design,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
at least in terms of the materials; they're always made of cheaper materials.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
But even sometimes a cheaper version

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
can actually have some charming aspects,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
can breathe a little extra life into a dying trend.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
There's lots of virtues of copying.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
One that a lot of cultural critics have pointed to

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
is that we now have

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
a much broader palette

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
of design choices to choose from than we ever have before,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
and this is mainly because of the fast fashion industry, actually.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And this is a good thing. We need lots of options.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Fashion, whether you like it or not,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
helps you project who you are to the world.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Because of fast fashion,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
global trends actually get established much more quickly than they used to.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And this, actually, is good news to trendsetters;

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
they want trends to be set

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
so that they can move product.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
For fashionistas,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
they want to stay ahead of the curve.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
They don't want to be wearing what everybody else is wearing.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
And so, they want to move on to the next trend

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
as soon as possible.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
I tell you, there is no rest for the fashionable.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Every season, these designers have to struggle

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
to come up with the new fabulous idea that everybody's going to love.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And this, let me tell you,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
is very good for the bottom line.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Now of course, there's a bunch of effects

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
that this culture of copying has

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
on the creative process.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
And Stuart Weitzman is a very successful shoe designer.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
He has complained a lot about people copying him,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
but in one interview I read,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
he said it has really forced him to up his game.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
He had to come up with new ideas,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
new things that would be hard to copy.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
He came up with this Bowden-wedge heel

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
that has to be made out of steel or titanium;

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
if you make it from some sort of cheaper material,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
it'll actually crack in two.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
It forced him to be a little more innovative. (Music)

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
And that actually reminded me

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
of jazz great, Charlie Parker.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
I don't know if you've heard this anecdote, but I have.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
He said that one of the reasons he invented bebop

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
was that he was pretty sure

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
that white musicians wouldn't be able to replicate the sound. (Laughter)

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
He wanted to make it too difficult to copy,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
and that's what fashion designers are doing all the time.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
They're trying to put together

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
a signature look, an aesthetic

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
that reflects who they are.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
When people knock it off, everybody knows

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
because they've put that look out on the runway,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
and it's a coherent aesthetic.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
I love these Gallianos.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Okay, we'll move on. (Laughter)

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
This is not unlike the world of comedy.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
I don't know if you know that jokes

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
also can't be copyright protected.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
So when one-liners were really popular,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
everybody stole them from one another.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
But now, we have a different kind of comic.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
They develop a persona,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
a signature style, much like fashion designers.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
And their jokes,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
much like the fashion designs by a fashion designer,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
really only work within that aesthetic.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
If somebody steals a joke

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
from Larry David, for instance,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
it's not as funny.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Now, the other thing that fashion designers have done

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
to survive in this culture of copying

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
is they've learned how to copy themselves.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
They knock themselves off.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
They make deals with the fast fashion giants

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
and they come up with a way to sell their product

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
to a whole new demographic:

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
the Santee Alley demographic.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Now, some fashion designers will say,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
"It's only in the United States that we don't have any respect.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
In other countries there is protection

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
for our artful designs."

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
But if you take a look at the two other biggest markets in the world,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
it turns out that the protection that's offered

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
is really ineffectual.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
In Japan, for instance, which I think is the third largest market,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
they have a design law; it protects apparel,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
but the novelty standard is so high,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
you have to prove that your garment has never existed before,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
it's totally unique.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And that's sort of like

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
the novelty standard for a U.S. patent,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
which fashion designers never get --

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
rarely get here in the states.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
In the European Union, they went in the other direction.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Very low novelty standard,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
anybody can register anything.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
But even though it's the home of the fast fashion industry

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
and you have a lot of luxury designers there,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
they don't register their garments, generally,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
and there's not a lot of litigation.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
It turns out it's because the novelty standard is too low.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
A person can come in and take somebody else's gown,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
cut off three inches from the bottom,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
go to the E.U. and register it as a new, original design.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
So, that does not stop the knock-off artists.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
If you look at the registry, actually,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
a lot of the registered things in the E.U.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
are Nike T-shirts

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
that are almost identical to one another.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
But this has not stopped Diane von Furstenberg.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
She is the head of

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
the Council of Fashion Designers of America,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
and she has told her constituency that

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
she is going to get copyright protection

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
for fashion designs.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
The retailers have kind of quashed this notion though.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
I don't think the legislation is going anywhere,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
because they realized it is so hard

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
to tell the difference between a pirated design

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
and something that's just part of a global trend.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Who owns a look?

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
That is a very difficult question to answer.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
It takes lots of lawyers and lots of court time,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
and the retailers decided that would be way too expensive.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
You know, it's not just the fashion industry

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
that doesn't have copyright protection.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
There's a bunch of other industries that don't have copyright protection,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
including the food industry.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
You cannot copyright a recipe

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
because it's a set of instructions, it's fact,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
and you cannot copyright the look and feel

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
of even the most unique dish.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Same with automobiles.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
It doesn't matter how wacky they look or how cool they look,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
you cannot copyright the sculptural design.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
It's a utilitarian article, that's why.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Same with furniture,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
it's too utilitarian.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Magic tricks, I think they're instructions, sort of like recipes:

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
no copyright protection.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Hairdos, no copyright protection.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Open source software, these guys decided

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
they didn't want copyright protection.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
They thought it'd be more innovative without it.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
It's really hard to get copyright for databases.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Tattoo artists, they don't want it; it's not cool.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
They share their designs.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Jokes, no copyright protection.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Fireworks displays,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
the rules of games,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
the smell of perfume: no.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
And some of these industries may seem

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
sort of marginal to you,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
but these are the gross sales

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
for low I.P. industries,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
industries with very little copyright protection,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
and there's the gross sales of

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
films and books.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
(Applause)

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
It ain't pretty.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
(Applause)

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
So you talk to people in the fashion industry

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
and they're like, "Shhh!

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Don't tell anybody

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
we can actually steal from each other's designs.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
It's embarrassing."

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
But you know what? It's revolutionary,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
and it's a model that a lot of other industries --

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
like the ones we just saw with the really small bars --

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
they might have to think about this.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Because right now, those industries with a lot of copyright protection

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
are operating in an atmosphere

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
where it's as if they don't have any protection,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
and they don't know what to do.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
When I found out that there are a whole bunch of industries

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
that didn't have copyright protection,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
I thought, "What exactly is the underlying logic?

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
I want a picture." And the lawyers do not provide a picture,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
so I made one.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
These are the two main

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
sort of binary oppositions within the logic of copyright law.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
It is more complex than this, but this will do.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
First: Is something an artistic object?

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Then it deserves protection.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Is it a utilitarian object?

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Then no, it does not deserve protection.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
This is a difficult, unstable binary.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
The other one is: Is it an idea?

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Is it something that needs to

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
freely circulate in a free society?

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
No protection.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Or is it a physically fixed

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
expression of an idea:

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
something that somebody made

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
and they deserve to own it for a while and make money from it?

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
The problem is that digital technology

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
has completely subverted the logic

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
of this physically fixed, expression

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
versus idea concept.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Nowadays,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
we don't really recognize a book

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
as something that sits on our shelf

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
or music as something that is

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
a physical object that we can hold.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
It's a digital file.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
It is barely tethered to any sort of

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
physical reality in our minds.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
And these things, because we can copy and transmit them so easily,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
actually circulate within our culture

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
a lot more like ideas

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
than like physically instantiated objects.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Now, the conceptual issues are truly profound

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
when you talk about creativity

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
and ownership

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
and, let me tell you, we don't want to leave this just to lawyers to figure out.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
They're smart.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
I'm with one. He's my boyfriend, he's okay.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
He's smart, he's smart.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
But you want an interdisciplinary team of people

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
hashing this out,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
trying to figure out: What is the kind of ownership model,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
in a digital world,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
that's going to lead to the most innovation?

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
And my suggestion is that

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
fashion might be a really good place

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
to start looking for a model

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
for creative industries in the future.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
If you want more information about this research project,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
please visit our website: it's ReadyToShare.org.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
And I really want to thank Veronica Jauriqui

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
for making this very fashionable presentation.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Thank you so much. (Applause)
