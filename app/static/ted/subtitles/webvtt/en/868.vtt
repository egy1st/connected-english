00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Today, I want you to look at

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
children who become suicide bombers

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
through a completely different lens.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
In 2009, there were 500

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
bomb blasts across Pakistan.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I spent the year working

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
with children

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
who were training to become suicide bombers

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and with Taliban recruiters,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
trying to understand how the Taliban

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
were converting these children

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
into live ammunition

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and why these children were actively

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
signing up to their cause.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I want you to watch a short video

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
from my latest documentary film, "Children of the Taliban."

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
(Singing)

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The Taliban now run their own schools.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
They target poor families

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and convince the parents to send their children.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
In return, they provide free food and shelter

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and sometimes pay the families a monthly stipend.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We've obtained a propaganda video

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
made by the Taliban.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Young boys are taught justifications

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
for suicide attacks

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and the execution of spies.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I made contact with a child from Swat

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
who studied in a madrassa like this.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Hazrat Ali is from a

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
poor farming family in Swat.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
He joined the Taliban a year ago

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
when he was 13.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
How do the Taliban in your area get people to join them?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Hazrat Ali: They first call us to the mosque and preach to us.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Then they take us to a madrassa

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and teach us things from the Koran.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy: He tells me that children

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
are then given months of military training.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
HA: They teach us to use machine guns, Kalashnikov,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
rocket launchers, grenades, bombs.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
They ask us to use them only against the infidels.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Then they teach us to do a suicide attack.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
SOC: Would you like to carry out a suicide attack?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
HA: If God gives me strength.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
SOC: I, in my research,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
have seen that the Taliban have perfected

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
the way in which they recruit

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and train children,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
and I think it's a five-step process.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Step one is that the Taliban prey

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
on families that are large, that are poor,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
that live in rural areas.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
They separate the parents from the children

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
by promising to provide food, clothing,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
shelter to these children.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Then they ship them off, hundreds of miles away

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
to hard-line schools

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
that run along the Taliban agenda.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Step two:

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
They teach the children the Koran, which is Islam's holiest book,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
in Arabic, a language these children do not understand

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
and cannot speak.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
They rely very heavily on teachers,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
who I have personally seen

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
distort the message to these children

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
as and when it suits their purpose to.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
These children are explicitly forbidden

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
from reading newspapers, listening to radio,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
reading any books

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
that the teachers do not prescribe them.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
If any child is found violating these rules,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
he is severely reprimanded.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Effectively, the Taliban create

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
a complete blackout

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
of any other source of information for these children.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Step three: The Taliban want these children

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
to hate the world that they currently live in.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
So they beat these children --

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
I have seen it;

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
they feed them twice a day dried bread and water;

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
they rarely allow them to play games;

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
they tell them that, for eight hours at a time,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
all they have to do is read the Koran.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
The children are virtual prisoners;

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
they cannot leave, they cannot go home.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Their parents are so poor,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
they have no resources to get them back.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Step four: The older members of the Taliban,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
the fighters,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
start talking to the younger boys

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
about the glories of martyrdom.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
They talk to them about how when they die,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
they will be received up

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
with lakes of honey and milk,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
how there will be 72 virgins

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
waiting for them in paradise,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
how there will be unlimited food,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
and how this glory

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
is going to propel them to become

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
heroes in their neighborhoods.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Effectively, this is the brainwashing process

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
that has begun.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Step five: I believe the Taliban have

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
one of the most effective

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
means of propaganda.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Their videos that they use

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
are intercut with photographs

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
of men and women and children

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
dying in Iraq and Afghanistan

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and in Pakistan.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
And the basic message is that the Western powers

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
do not care about civilian deaths,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
so those people who live

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
in areas and support governments

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
that work with Western powers are fair game.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
That's why Pakistani civilians,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
over 6,000 of whom have been killed in the last two years alone,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
are fair game.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Now these children are primed

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
to become suicide bombers.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
They're ready to go out and fight

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
because they've been told that this is

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
effectively their only way

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
to glorify Islam.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
I want you to watch another excerpt from the film.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
This boy is called Zenola.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
He blew himself up, killing six.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
This boy is called Sadik.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
He killed 22.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
This boy is called Messoud.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
He killed 28.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
The Taliban are running suicide schools,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
preparing a generation of boys

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
for atrocities against civilians.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Do you want to carry out a suicide attack?

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Boy: I would love to.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
But only if I get permission from my dad.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000
When I look at suicide bombers younger than me, or my age,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
I get so inspired by their terrific attacks.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
SOC: What blessing would you get

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
from carrying out a suicide attack?

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Boy: On the day of judgment, God will ask me,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
"Why did you do that?"

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
I will answer, "My Lord! Only to make you happy!

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
I have laid down my life fighting the infidels."

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Then God will look at my intention.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000
If my intention was to eradicate evil for Islam,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
then I will be rewarded with paradise.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Singer: ♫ On the day of judgment ♫

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
♫ My God will call me ♫

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
♫ My body will be put back together ♫

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
♫ And God will ask me why I did this ♫

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
SOC: I leave you all with this thought:

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
If you grew up in these circumstances,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
faced with these choices,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
would you choose to live in this world

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
or in the glorious afterlife?

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
As one Taliban recruiter told me,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
"There will always be sacrificial lambs in this war."

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Thank you.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
(Applause)
