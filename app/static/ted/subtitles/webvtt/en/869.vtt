00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Do you worry about what is going to kill you?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Heart disease, cancer,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
a car accident?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Most of us worry about things we can't control,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
like war, terrorism,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
the tragic earthquake that just occurred in Haiti.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
But what really threatens humanity?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
A few years ago, Professor Vaclav Smil

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
tried to calculate the probability

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
of sudden disasters

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
large enough to change history.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
He called these,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
"massively fatal discontinuities,"

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
meaning that they could kill

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
up to 100 million people

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
in the next 50 years.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
He looked at the odds of another world war,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
of a massive volcanic eruption,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
even of an asteroid hitting the Earth.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
But he placed the likelihood of one such event

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
above all others

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
at close to 100 percent,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and that is a severe flu pandemic.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Now, you might think of flu

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
as just a really bad cold,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
but it can be a death sentence.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Every year, 36,000 people in the United States

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
die of seasonal flu.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
In the developing world, the data is much sketchier

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
but the death toll is almost

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
certainly higher.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
You know, the problem is if

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
this virus occasionally mutates

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
so dramatically,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
it essentially is a new virus

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and then we get a pandemic.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
In 1918, a new virus appeared

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
that killed some 50 to 100 million people.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
It spread like wildfire

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and some died within hours of developing symptoms.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Are we safer today?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Well, we seem to have dodged

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
the deadly pandemic this year

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
that most of us feared,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
but this threat could reappear at any time.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
The good news is that

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
we're at a moment in time

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
when science, technology, globalization is converging

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
to create an unprecedented possibility:

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
the possibility to make history

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
by preventing infectious diseases

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
that still account for one-fifth of all deaths

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and countless misery on Earth.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
We can do this.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
We're already preventing millions of deaths

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
with existing vaccines,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and if we get these to more people,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
we can certainly save more lives.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
But with new or better vaccines

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
for malaria, TB, HIV,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
pneumonia, diarrhea, flu,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
we could end suffering

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
that has been on the Earth since the beginning of time.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
So, I'm here to trumpet vaccines for you.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
But first, I have to explain why they're important

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
because vaccines, the power of them,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
is really like a whisper.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
When they work, they can make history,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
but after a while

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
you can barely hear them.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Now, some of us are old enough

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
to have a small, circular scar on our arms

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
from an inoculation we received as children.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
But when was the last time you worried about smallpox,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
a disease that killed half a billion people last century

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and no longer is with us?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Or polio? How many of you remember the iron lung?

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
We don't see scenes like this anymore

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
because of vaccines.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Now, it's interesting

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
because there are 30-odd diseases

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
that can be treated with vaccines now,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
but we're still threatened by things like HIV and flu.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Why is that?

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Well, here's the dirty little secret.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Until recently, we haven't had to know

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
exactly how a vaccine worked.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
We knew they worked through old-fashioned trial and error.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
You took a pathogen, you modified it,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
you injected it into a person or an animal

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
and you saw what happened.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
This worked well for most pathogens,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
somewhat well for crafty bugs like flu,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
but not at all for HIV,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
for which humans have no natural immunity.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
So let's explore how vaccines work.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
They basically create a cache

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
of weapons for your immune system

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
which you can deploy when needed.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Now, when you get a viral infection,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
what normally happens is it takes days or weeks

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
for your body to fight back

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
at full strength,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
and that might be too late.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
When you're pre-immunized,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
what happens is you have forces in your body

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
pre-trained to recognize

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
and defeat specific foes.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
So that's really how vaccines work.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Now, let's take a look at a video

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
that we're debuting at TED, for the first time,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
on how an effective HIV vaccine might work.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000
(Music)

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Narrator: A vaccine trains the body in advance

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
how to recognize and neutralize

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
a specific invader.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
After HIV penetrates the body's mucosal barriers,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
it infects immune cells to replicate.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
The invader draws the attention

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
of the immune system's front-line troops.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Dendritic cells, or macrophages,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
capture the virus and display pieces of it.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Memory cells generated by the HIV vaccine

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
are activated when they learn

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
HIV is present from the front-line troops.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
These memory cells immediately deploy

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
the exact weapons needed.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Memory B cells turn into plasma cells,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
which produce wave after wave

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
of the specific antibodies

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
that latch onto HIV

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
to prevent it from infecting cells,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
while squadrons of killer T cells

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
seek out and destroy cells

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
that are already HIV infected.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
The virus is defeated.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Without a vaccine,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
these responses would have taken more than a week.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
By that time, the battle against HIV

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
would already have been lost.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Seth Berkley: Really cool video, isn't it?

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
The antibodies you just saw in this video,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
in action, are the ones that make most vaccines work.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
So the real question then is:

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
How do we ensure that your body makes

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
the exact ones that we need to protect

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
against flu and HIV?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
The principal challenge for both of these viruses

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
is that they're always changing.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
So let's take a look at the flu virus.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
In this rendering of the flu virus,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
these different colored spikes are what it uses to infect you.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And also, what the antibodies use is a handle

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
to essentially grab and neutralize the virus.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
When these mutate, they change their shape,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
and the antibodies don't know what they're looking at anymore.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
So that's why every year

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
you can catch a slightly different strain of flu.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
It's also why in the spring,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
we have to make a best guess

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
at which three strains are going to prevail the next year,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
put those into a single vaccine

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
and rush those into production for the fall.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Even worse,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
the most common influenza -- influenza A --

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
also infects animals

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
that live in close proximity to humans,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
and they can recombine

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
in those particular animals.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
In addition, wild aquatic birds

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
carry all known strains

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
of influenza.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
So, you've got this situation:

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
In 2003,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
we had an H5N1 virus

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
that jumped from birds into humans

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
in a few isolated cases

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
with an apparent mortality rate of 70 percent.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Now luckily, that particular virus,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
although very scary at the time,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
did not transmit from person to person

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
very easily.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
This year's H1N1 threat

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
was actually a human, avian, swine mixture

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
that arose in Mexico.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
It was easily transmitted,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
but, luckily, was pretty mild.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
And so, in a sense,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
our luck is holding out,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
but you know, another wild bird could fly over at anytime.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Now let's take a look at HIV.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
As variable as flu is,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
HIV makes flu

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
look like the Rock of Gibraltar.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
The virus that causes AIDS

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
is the trickiest pathogen

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
scientists have ever confronted.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
It mutates furiously,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
it has decoys to evade the immune system,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
it attacks the very cells that are trying to fight it

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
and it quickly hides itself

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
in your genome.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Here's a slide looking at

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
the genetic variation of flu

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
and comparing that to HIV,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
a much wilder target.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
In the video a moment ago,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
you saw fleets of new viruses launching from infected cells.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Now realize that in a recently infected person,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
there are millions of these ships;

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
each one is just slightly different.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Finding a weapon that recognizes

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
and sinks all of them

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
makes the job that much harder.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Now, in the 27 years since HIV

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
was identified as the cause of AIDS,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
we've developed more drugs to treat HIV

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
than all other viruses put together.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
These drugs aren't cures,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
but they represent a huge triumph of science

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
because they take away the automatic death sentence

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
from a diagnosis of HIV,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
at least for those who can access them.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
The vaccine effort though is really quite different.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Large companies moved away from it

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
because they thought the science was so difficult

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
and vaccines were seen as poor business.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Many thought that it was just impossible to make an AIDS vaccine,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
but today, evidence tells us otherwise.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
In September,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
we had surprising but exciting findings

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
from a clinical trial that took place in Thailand.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
For the first time, we saw an AIDS vaccine work in humans --

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
albeit, quite modestly --

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
and that particular vaccine was made

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
almost a decade ago.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Newer concepts and early testing now

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
show even greater promise in the best of our animal models.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
But in the past few months, researchers have also isolated

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
several new broadly neutralizing antibodies

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
from the blood of an HIV infected individual.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Now, what does this mean?

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
We saw earlier that HIV

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
is highly variable,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
that a broad neutralizing antibody

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
latches on and disables

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
multiple variations of the virus.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
If you take these and you put them

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
in the best of our monkey models,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
they provide full protection from infection.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
In addition, these researchers found

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
a new site on HIV

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
where the antibodies can grab onto,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
and what's so special about this spot

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
is that it changes very little

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
as the virus mutates.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
It's like, as many times

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
as the virus changes its clothes,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000
it's still wearing the same socks,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
and now our job is to make sure

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
we get the body to really hate those socks.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
So what we've got is a situation.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
The Thai results tell us

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
we can make an AIDS vaccine,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
and the antibody findings

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
tell us how we might do that.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
This strategy, working backwards

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
from an antibody to create a vaccine candidate,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
has never been done before in vaccine research.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
It's called retro-vaccinology,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
and its implications extend

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
way beyond that of just HIV.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
So think of it this way.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
We've got these new antibodies we've identified,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
and we know that they latch onto many, many variations of the virus.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
We know that they have to latch onto a specific part,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
so if we can figure out the precise structure of that part,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
present that through a vaccine,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
what we hope is we can prompt

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
your immune system to make these matching antibodies.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
And that would create

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
a universal HIV vaccine.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Now, it sounds easier than it is

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
because the structure actually looks more like

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
this blue antibody diagram

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
attached to its yellow binding site,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
and as you can imagine, these three-dimensional structures

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
are much harder to work on.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
And if you guys have ideas to help us solve this,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
we'd love to hear about it.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
But, you know, the research that has occurred from HIV now

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
has really helped with innovation with other diseases.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
So for instance, a biotechnology company

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
has now found broadly neutralizing

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
antibodies to influenza,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
as well as a new antibody target on the flu virus.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
They're currently making a cocktail --

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
an antibody cocktail -- that can be used to treat

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
severe, overwhelming cases of flu.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
In the longer term, what they can do

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
is use these tools of retro-vaccinology

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
to make a preventive flu vaccine.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Now, retro-vaccinology is just one technique

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
within the ambit of so-called rational vaccine design.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Let me give you another example.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
We talked about before the H and N spikes

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
on the surface of the flu virus.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Notice these other, smaller protuberances.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
These are largely hidden from the immune system.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Now it turns out that these spots

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
also don't change much when the virus mutates.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
If you can cripple these with specific antibodies,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
you could cripple all versions of the flu.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
So far, animal tests indicate

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
that such a vaccine could prevent severe disease,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
although you might get a mild case.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
So if this works in humans, what we're talking about

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
is a universal flu vaccine,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
one that doesn't need to change every year

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
and would remove the threat of death.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
We really could think of flu, then,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
as just a bad cold.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Of course, the best vaccine imaginable

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
is only valuable to the extent

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
we get it to everyone who needs it.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
So to do that, we have to combine

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
smart vaccine design with smart production methods

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
and, of course, smart delivery methods.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
So I want you to think back a few months ago.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
In June, the World Health Organization

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
declared the first global

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
flu pandemic in 41 years.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
The U.S. government promised

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
150 million doses of vaccine

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
by October 15th for the flu peak.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Vaccines were promised to developing countries.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Hundreds of millions of dollars were spent

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
and flowed to accelerating vaccine manufacturing.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
So what happened?

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Well, we first figured out

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
how to make flu vaccines, how to produce them,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
in the early 1940s.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
It was a slow, cumbersome process

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
that depended on chicken eggs,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
millions of living chicken eggs.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Viruses only grow in living things,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
and so it turned out that, for flu,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
chicken eggs worked really well.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
For most strains, you could get one to two doses

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
of vaccine per egg.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Luckily for us,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
we live in an era of breathtaking

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
biomedical advances.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
So today, we get our flu vaccines from ...

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
chicken eggs,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
(Laughter)

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
hundreds of millions of chicken eggs.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Almost nothing has changed.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
The system is reliable

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
but the problem is you never know how well

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
a strain is going to grow.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
This year's swine flu strain

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
grew very poorly in early production:

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
basically .6 doses per egg.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
So, here's an alarming thought.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
What if that wild bird flies by again?

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
You could see an avian strain

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
that would infect the poultry flocks,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
and then we would have no eggs for our vaccines.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
So, Dan [Barber], if you want

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
billions of chicken pellets

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
for your fish farm,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
I know where to get them.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
So right now, the world can produce

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
about 350 million doses

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
of flu vaccine for the three strains,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
and we can up that to about 1.2 billion doses

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
if we want to target a single variant

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
like swine flu.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
But this assumes that our factories are humming

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
because, in 2004,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
the U.S. supply was cut in half

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
by contamination at one single plant.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
And the process still takes

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
more than half a year.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
So are we better prepared

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
than we were in 1918?

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Well, with the new technologies emerging now,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
I hope we can say definitively, "Yes."

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Imagine we could produce enough flu vaccine

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
for everyone in the entire world

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
for less than half of what we're currently spending

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
now in the United States.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
With a range of new technologies, we could.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Here's an example:

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
A company I'm engaged with has found

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
a specific piece of the H spike of flu

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
that sparks the immune system.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
If you lop this off and attach it

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
to the tail of a different bacterium,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
which creates a vigorous immune response,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
they've created a very powerful flu fighter.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
This vaccine is so small

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
it can be grown in a common bacteria, E. coli.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Now, as you know, bacteria reproduce quickly --

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
it's like making yogurt --

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
and so we could produce enough swine origin flu

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
for the entire world in a few factories, in a few weeks,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
with no eggs,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
for a fraction of the cost of current methods.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000
(Applause)

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
So here's a comparison of several of these new vaccine technologies.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
And, aside from the radically increased production

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
and huge cost savings --

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
for example, the E. coli method I just talked about --

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
look at the time saved: this would be lives saved.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
The developing world,

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
mostly left out of the current response,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
sees the potential of these alternate technologies

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
and they're leapfrogging the West.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
India, Mexico and others are already

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
making experimental flu vaccines,

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
and they may be the first place

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
we see these vaccines in use.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Because these technologies are so efficient

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
and relatively cheap,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
billions of people can have access to lifesaving vaccines

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
if we can figure out how to deliver them.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Now think of where this leads us.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
New infectious diseases

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
appear or reappear

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
every few years.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Some day, perhaps soon,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
we'll have a virus that is going to threaten all of us.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
Will we be quick enough to react

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
before millions die?

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Luckily, this year's flu was relatively mild.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
I say, "luckily" in part

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
because virtually no one in the developing world

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
was vaccinated.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
So if we have the political and financial foresight

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
to sustain our investments,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
we will master these and new tools of vaccinology,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
and with these tools we can produce

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
enough vaccine for everyone at low cost

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
and ensure healthy productive lives.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
No longer must flu have to kill half a million people a year.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
No longer does AIDS

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
need to kill two million a year.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
No longer do the poor and vulnerable

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
need to be threatened by infectious diseases,

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
or indeed, anybody.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Instead of having Vaclav Smil's

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
"massively fatal discontinuity" of life,

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
we can ensure

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
the continuity of life.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
What the world needs now are these new vaccines,

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
and we can make it happen.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Thank you very much.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:44.000
(Applause)

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
Chris Anderson: Thank you.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:51.000
(Applause)

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Thank you.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
So, the science is changing.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
In your mind, Seth -- I mean, you must dream about this --

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
what is the kind of time scale

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
on, let's start with HIV,

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
for a game-changing vaccine that's actually out there and usable?

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
SB: The game change can come at any time,

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
because the problem we have now is

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
we've shown we can get a vaccine to work in humans;

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
we just need a better one.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
And with these types of antibodies, we know humans can make them.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
So, if we can figure out how to do that,

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
then we have the vaccine,

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
and what's interesting is there already is

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
some evidence that we're beginning to crack that problem.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
So, the challenge is full speed ahead.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
CA: In your gut, do you think it's probably going to be at least another five years?

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
SB: You know, everybody says it's 10 years,

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
but it's been 10 years every 10 years.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
So I hate to put a timeline

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
on scientific innovation,

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
but the investments that have occurred are now paying dividends.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
CA: And that's the same with universal flu vaccine, the same kind of thing?

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
SB: I think flu is different. I think what happened with flu is

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000
we've got a bunch -- I just showed some of this --

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000
a bunch of really cool and useful technologies that are ready to go now.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
They look good. The problem has been that,

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000
what we did is we invested in traditional technologies

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
because that's what we were comfortable with.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000
You also can use adjuvants, which are chemicals you mix.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
That's what Europe is doing, so we could have diluted out

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
our supply of flu and made more available,

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
but, going back to what Michael Specter said,

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
the anti-vaccine crowd didn't really want that to happen.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
CA: And malaria's even further behind?

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
SB: No, malaria, there is a candidate

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000
that actually showed efficacy in an earlier trial

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
and is currently in phase three trials now.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
It probably isn't the perfect vaccine, but it's moving along.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
CA: Seth, most of us do work where every month,

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
we produce something;

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
we get that kind of gratification.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000
You've been slaving away at this for more than a decade,

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000
and I salute you and your colleagues for what you do.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
The world needs people like you. Thank you.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
SB: Thank you.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
(Applause)
