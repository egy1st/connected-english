You know, when Chris first approached me
to speak at TED, I said no,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.143
because I felt
like I wasn't going to be able

00:00:08.167 --> 00:00:11.406
to make that personal connection,
you know, that I wanted to.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:12.976
It's such a large conference.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.499
But he explained to me
that he was in a bind,

00:00:15.523 --> 00:00:18.976
and that he was having trouble
finding the kind of sex appeal

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.976
and star power that
the conference was known for.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.835
So I said fine, Ted -- I mean Chris.

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:26.976
I'll come on two conditions.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.842
One: I want to speak as early
in the morning as possible.

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.616
And two: I want to pick
the theme for TED 2006.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.749
And luckily he agreed.

00:00:38.773 --> 00:00:43.455
And the theme, in two years,
is going to be "Cute Pictures Of Puppies."

which he kept away from the rebel
leaders during the course of the war.

for the rehabilitation of water reserves

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:55.531
When the war broke out,

00:02:55.555 --> 00:02:58.001
the rebel leader demanded
the fund be given to him,

00:02:58.025 --> 00:03:01.328
my father insisted it
was not in his possession,

00:03:01.352 --> 00:03:04.267
and he was killed because of his refusal
to release the fund.

00:03:04.655 --> 00:03:05.898

in a safe, reliable security company
in Dakar, Senegal,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.976
where I was only given temporary asylum.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.976
I do not wish to invest
the money in Senegal

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.743
due to unfavorable economic climate,
and so close to my country.

The only assistance I need from you,
which I know you would do for me,

00:03:41.811 --> 00:03:44.752
are the following:
one, be a silent partner

and receive the funds
in your account in trust;

under your control

(Laughter)

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.915
And I know what you're saying,

00:09:40.939 --> 00:09:42.170
"Holy crap!

00:09:42.194 --> 00:09:43.976
How is his presentation so smooth?"

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.348
(Laughter)

00:09:47.372 --> 00:09:50.195
And I have to say
that it's not all me this year.

00:09:50.219 --> 00:09:54.976
I guess Chris has to take some credit
here, because in years past,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.710
I guess there's been
some sort of subpar speakers at TED.

00:09:57.734 --> 00:09:58.976
I don't know.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.976
And so, this year, Chris sent us
a TED conference simulator.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.407
(Laughter)

00:10:04.431 --> 00:10:09.976
Which really allowed us as speakers
to get there, in the trenches,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.976
and practice at home so that we would be
ready for this experience.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.976
And I've got to say that, you know,
it's really, really great to be here.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.845
(Pre-recorded applause)

00:10:20.869 --> 00:10:22.965
I'd like to tell all of you a little joke.

00:10:23.019 --> 00:10:25.454
(Pre-recorded applause and cheering)

00:10:25.478 --> 00:10:27.611
Not just the good stuff, though.

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.627
You can do heckler mode.

00:10:30.651 --> 00:10:33.375
Voice: Hey, moron, get off the stage!

00:10:33.399 --> 00:10:34.976
ZF: You get off the stage.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.976
(Laughter)

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.195
Voice: We want Malcolm Gladwell.

00:10:39.219 --> 00:10:42.970
(Laughter)

00:10:42.994 --> 00:10:45.389
(Baby cooing)

00:10:45.413 --> 00:10:50.886
(Huge crowd applauding)

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:52.484
In case you run over time.

00:10:52.508 --> 00:10:53.658
(Heroic music)

00:10:53.682 --> 00:10:56.076
Just one last thing
I'd like to say, I'd, really --

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:57.976
(Laughter)

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.343
I'd like to thank all of you
for being here.

00:11:00.367 --> 00:11:01.530
(Loud music)

00:11:01.554 --> 00:11:03.690
(Laughter)

00:11:03.714 --> 00:11:05.118
And frog mode.

00:11:05.142 --> 00:11:07.959
(Singing)

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.371
(Sings) "Ah, the first time that I made
love to a rock shrimp --"

00:11:20.395 --> 00:11:23.842
(Laughter)

00:11:23.866 --> 00:11:26.466
[Spam jokes are the new airplane jokes]

00:11:27.104 --> 00:11:28.176
(Sighs)

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.472
It's true.

00:11:29.496 --> 00:11:32.168
Some people say to me,

00:11:32.192 --> 00:11:34.731
"Ze, you're doing all this stuff,
this Internet stuff,

00:11:34.755 --> 00:11:36.386
and you're not making any money."

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:38.976
(Laughter)

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.328
"Why?" And I say, "Mom, Dad --

00:11:41.352 --> 00:11:44.976
(Laughter)

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.194
I'm trying."

00:11:46.863 --> 00:11:48.976
I don't know if you're all aware of this,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.976
but the video game market,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.844
kids are playing these video games,

00:11:53.868 --> 00:11:55.920
but, supposedly, there's tons of money.

00:11:55.944 --> 00:11:59.167
I mean, like, I think,
100,000 dollars or so a year

00:11:59.191 --> 00:12:00.786
is being spent on these things.

00:12:01.239 --> 00:12:04.797
So I decided to try my hand.

00:12:05.177 --> 00:12:06.604
I came up with a few games.

00:12:06.628 --> 00:12:08.722
(Laughter)

00:12:08.746 --> 00:12:09.976
This is called "Atheist."

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.643
I figured it would be popular
with the young kids.

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:14.364
OK.

00:12:14.388 --> 00:12:17.000
Look, I'll move around
and say some things.

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:19.560
(Sighs)

00:12:20.218 --> 00:12:22.526
[Game over. There is no replay.]

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:24.328
(Laughter)

00:12:24.352 --> 00:12:25.976
So that didn't go over so well.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.333
(Laughter)

00:12:29.357 --> 00:12:31.627
I don't really understand
why you're laughing.

00:12:31.651 --> 00:12:32.976
(Laughter)

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.479
Should have done this
before I tried to pitch it.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.976
"Buddhist," of course, looks
very, very similar to "Atheist."

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.085
(Laughter)

00:12:42.109 --> 00:12:43.976
But you come back as a duck.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.976
(Laughter)

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.429
And this is great because,
you know, for a quarter,

00:12:52.453 --> 00:12:54.429
you can play this for a long time.

00:12:54.453 --> 00:12:55.977
(Laughter)

00:12:56.001 --> 00:12:57.778
And Chris had said in an email

00:12:57.802 --> 00:13:00.149
that we should really bring
something new to TED,

00:13:00.173 --> 00:13:02.625
something that we haven't shown anyone.

00:13:03.849 --> 00:13:05.976
So, I made this for TED. It's "Christian."

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.454
It's the third in the series.

00:13:07.478 --> 00:13:09.610
I'm hoping it's going
to do well this year.

00:13:10.191 --> 00:13:11.341
(Sighs)

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.976
(Laughter)

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.254
Do you have a preference?

00:13:16.278 --> 00:13:18.407
(Laughter)

00:13:18.431 --> 00:13:19.581
Good choice.

00:13:19.605 --> 00:13:22.647
(Laughter)

00:13:22.671 --> 00:13:25.381
So you can wait for the Second Coming,

00:13:25.405 --> 00:13:29.976
which is a random number
between one and 500 million.

00:13:30.744 --> 00:13:33.926
(Laughter)

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:36.717
So really, what are we talking about here?

00:13:36.741 --> 00:13:37.976
Oh, tech joy.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.393
(Laughter)

00:13:40.417 --> 00:13:44.119
Tech joy, to me, means something,
because I get a lot of joy out of tech.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.976
And in fact, making things
using technology --

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.428
and I'm being serious here,

00:13:50.452 --> 00:13:53.597
even though I'm using
my sarcastic voice -- I won't -- hold on.

00:13:54.657 --> 00:13:57.712
Making things, you know --

00:13:57.736 --> 00:14:00.042
making things actually
does give me a lot of joy.

00:14:00.066 --> 00:14:02.381
It's the process of creation that keeps me

00:14:02.405 --> 00:14:05.976
sort of a bubble and a half
above perpetual anxiety in my life,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.429
and it's that feeling of being
about 80 percent complete on a project --

00:14:09.453 --> 00:14:11.644
where you know you still have
something to do,

00:14:11.668 --> 00:14:14.976
but it's not finished,
and you're not starting something --

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.690
that really fills my entire life.

00:14:17.714 --> 00:14:19.548
And so, what I've done is,

00:14:19.572 --> 00:14:23.178
I started getting interested
in creating online social spaces

00:14:23.202 --> 00:14:24.672
to share that feeling

00:14:24.696 --> 00:14:27.100
with people who don't consider
themselves artists.

00:14:27.124 --> 00:14:29.598
We're in a culture of guru-ship.

00:14:29.622 --> 00:14:33.454
It's so hard to use some software
because, you know, it's unapproachable,

00:14:33.478 --> 00:14:36.054
people feel like they have
to read the manual.

00:14:36.078 --> 00:14:41.670
So I try to create
these very minimal activities

00:14:41.694 --> 00:14:45.124
that allow people to express
themselves, and, hopefully --

00:14:45.148 --> 00:14:48.976
("The End" by The Doors)

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.976
Whoa! I'm like -- on the page,
but it doesn't exist.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.362
(Laughter)

00:14:56.386 --> 00:14:59.374
It's, like -- seriously, though --

00:14:59.398 --> 00:15:01.976
(Laughter)

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.976
I try to create meaningful environments
for people to express themselves.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.063
(Laughter)

00:15:07.087 --> 00:15:10.976
Here I created a contest called,
"When Office Supplies Attack,"

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.976
which, I think, really resonated
with the working population.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.158
(Laughter)

00:15:17.182 --> 00:15:20.643
Over 500 entries in three weeks.

00:15:21.554 --> 00:15:22.976
Toilet paper fashion.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.843
(Laughter)

00:15:25.867 --> 00:15:28.154
Again, people from all over the country.

00:15:28.178 --> 00:15:30.286
The watch is particularly incredible.

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:32.976
(Laughter)

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.784
Online drawing tools --
you've probably seen a lot of them.

00:15:35.808 --> 00:15:37.055
I think they're wonderful.

00:15:37.079 --> 00:15:39.551
It's a chance for people
to get to play with crayons

00:15:39.575 --> 00:15:40.861
and all that kind of stuff.

00:15:40.885 --> 00:15:43.238
But I'm interested
in the process of creating,

00:15:43.262 --> 00:15:46.440
as the real event that I'm interested in.

00:15:46.464 --> 00:15:50.598
And the problem is that
a lot of people suck at drawing,

00:15:50.622 --> 00:15:54.588
and they get bummed out at this,
sort of, you know, stick figure,

00:15:54.612 --> 00:15:56.815
awful little thing that they created.

00:15:56.839 --> 00:15:59.976
And eventually, it just makes them
stop playing with it,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.521
or they draw penises and things like that.

00:16:02.545 --> 00:16:03.976
(Laughter)

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.405
So, the Scribbler is an attempt
to create a generative tool.

00:16:07.429 --> 00:16:09.976
In other words, it's a helping tool.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.810
You can draw your simple stick figure,

00:16:11.834 --> 00:16:15.976
and it collaborates with you to create
sort of a post-war German etching.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.206
(Laughter)

00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:25.055
In fact, it's tuned to be better
at drawing things that look worse.

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:28.944
So, we go ahead, and we start scribbling.

00:16:29.888 --> 00:16:33.976
So the idea is that you can really,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.976
you know, partake in this process,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.976
but watch something
really crappy look beautiful.

00:16:40.853 --> 00:16:42.563
And here are some of my favorites.

00:16:42.587 --> 00:16:46.445
This is the little trap marionette
that was submitted to me.

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:50.548
Very cool.

00:16:50.572 --> 00:16:51.693
(Laughter)

00:16:53.257 --> 00:16:54.486
Darling.

00:16:55.201 --> 00:16:56.490
Beautiful stuff.

00:16:57.713 --> 00:16:59.391
I mean this is incredible.

00:16:59.415 --> 00:17:02.116
An 11-year-old girl drew this
and submitted it.

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:03.847
It's just gorgeous.

00:17:03.871 --> 00:17:05.395
(Laughter)

00:17:05.419 --> 00:17:07.187
I'm dead serious here.

00:17:07.211 --> 00:17:08.658
This is not a joke.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.976
(Laughter)

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.295
But, I think it's a really fun
and wonderful thing.

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:17.481
So this is called the "Fiction Project."

00:17:17.505 --> 00:17:19.478
This is an online space,

00:17:19.502 --> 00:17:22.976
which is basically
a refurbished message board

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.730
that encourages collaborative
fiction writing.

00:17:25.754 --> 00:17:26.976
These are haikus.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.381
None of the haikus were written
by the same person.

00:17:29.405 --> 00:17:33.361
In fact, each line is contributed
by a different person

00:17:33.385 --> 00:17:34.976
at a different time.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.842
I think that the "now tied up, tied down,

00:17:38.866 --> 00:17:41.646
mistress cruel approaches me,
now tied down, it's up."

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.976
It's an amazing way, and I'll tell you,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.428
if you come home, and your spouse,
or whoever it is,

00:17:51.452 --> 00:17:53.198
says, "Let's talk" --

00:17:55.063 --> 00:17:58.545
That, like, chills you to the very core.

00:17:58.569 --> 00:17:59.624
(Laughter)

00:17:59.648 --> 00:18:01.823
But it's peripheral activities like these

00:18:01.847 --> 00:18:04.976
that allow people to get together,
doing fun things.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.762
They actually get to know each other,

00:18:06.786 --> 00:18:10.356
and it's sort of like low-threshold
peripheral activities

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:12.346
that I think are the key to bringing up

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:14.894
some of our bonding social capital
that we're lacking.

00:18:14.918 --> 00:18:17.282
And very, very quickly --
I love puppets.

00:18:17.306 --> 00:18:19.291
Here's a puppet.

00:18:19.315 --> 00:18:20.499
It dances to music.

00:18:20.523 --> 00:18:24.976
Lotte Reiniger, an amazing
shadow puppeteer in the 20s,

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.969
that started doing more elaborate things.

00:18:26.993 --> 00:18:28.470
I became interested in puppets,

00:18:28.494 --> 00:18:30.683
and I just want to show
one last thing to you.

00:18:30.707 --> 00:18:32.279
Oh, this is how you make puppets.

00:18:32.303 --> 00:18:33.889
(Applause)

00:18:33.913 --> 00:18:36.429
Chris Anderson: Ladies
and gentlemen, Mr. Ze Frank.

00:18:36.453 --> 00:18:39.453
(Applause)
