WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I want to talk about

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
what we learn from conservatives.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And I'm at a stage in life where I'm yearning for my old days,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
so I want to confess to you

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
that when I was a kid,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
indeed, I was a conservative.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I was a Young Republican, a Teenage Republican,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
a leader in the Teenage Republicans.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Indeed, I was the youngest member

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
of any delegation

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
in the 1980 convention that elected Ronald Reagan

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
to be the Republican nominee for president.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Now, I know what you're thinking.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
(Laughter)

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
You're thinking, "That's not what the Internets say."

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
You're thinking, "Wikipedia doesn't say this fact."

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And indeed, this is just one of the examples

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
of the junk that flows across the tubes

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
in these Internets here.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Wikipedia reports that this guy,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
this former congressman from Erie, Pennsylvania

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
was, at the age of 20, one of the youngest people

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
at the Republican National Convention,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
but it's just not true.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
(Laughter)

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Indeed, it drives me so nuts, let me just change this little fact here.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
(Laughter)

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
(Applause)

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
All right. Okay, so ... perfect.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Perfect.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
(Laughter)

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Okay, speaker Lawrence Lessig, right.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Okay.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Finally, truth will be brought here.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Okay, see? It's done. It's almost done. Here we go.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
"... Youngest Republican," okay, we're finished.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
That's it. Please save this.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Great, here we go.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
And ... Wikipedia is fixed, finally.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Okay, but no, this is really besides the point.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
(Applause)

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
But the thing I want you to think about when we think about conservatives --

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
not so much this issue of the 1980 convention --

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
the thing to think about is this:

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
They go to church.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Now, you know, I mean, a lot of people go to church.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I'm not talking about that only conservatives go to church.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And I'm not talking about the God thing.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I don't want to get into that, you know; that's not my point.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
They go to church, by which I mean,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
they do lots of things for free for each other.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
They hold potluck dinners.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Indeed, they sell books about potluck dinners.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
They serve food to poor people.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
They share, they give,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
they give away for free.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And it's the very same people

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
leading Wall Street firms

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
who, on Sundays, show up

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and share.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And not only food, right.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
These very same people

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
are strong believers, in lots of contexts,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
in the limits on the markets.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
They are in many important places

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
against markets.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Indeed, they, like all of us, celebrate this kind of relationship.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
But they're very keen that we don't

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
let money drop into that relationship,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
else it turns into something like this.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
They want to regulate us, those conservatives,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
to stop us from allowing the market to spread in those places.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Because they understand:

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
There are places for the market

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
and places where the market should not exist,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
where we should be free

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
to enjoy the fellowship of others.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
They recognize: Both of these things have to live together.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And the second great thing about conservatives:

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
they get ecology.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Right, it was the first great Republican president of the 20th century

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
who taught us about

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
environmental thinking -- Teddy Roosevelt.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
They first taught us about ecology

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
in the context of natural resources.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
And then they began to teach us in the context of

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
innovation, economics.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
They understand, in that context,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
"free." They understand "free" is an important

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
essential part of the

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
cultural ecology as well.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
That's the thing I want you to think about them.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Now, I know

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
you don't believe me, really, here.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
So here's exhibit number one.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
I want to share with you my latest hero, Julian Sanchez,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
a libertarian who works at the, for many people,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
"evil" Cato Institute.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Okay, so Julian made this video.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
He's a terrible producer of videos,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
but it's great content, so I'm going to give you a little bit of it.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
So here he is beginning.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Julian Sanchez: I'm going to make an observation about the way

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
remix culture seems to be evolving ...

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Larry Lessig: So what he does is he begins to tell us

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
about these three videos.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
This is this fantastic Brat Pack remix

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
set to Lisztomania.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Which, of course, spread virally.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Hugely successful.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
(Music)

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
And then some people from Brooklyn saw it.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
They decided they wanted to do the same.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.000
(Music)

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
And then, of course, people from San Fransisco saw it.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And San Franciscans thought they had to do the same as well.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:38.000
(Music)

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
And so they're beautiful, but this libertarian

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
has some important lessons he wants us to learn from this.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Here's lesson number one.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
JS: There's obviously also something really deeply great about this.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
They are acting in the sense that they're

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
emulating the original mashup.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
And the guy who shot it obviously has a strong eye

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
and some experience with video editing.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
But this is also basically just a group of friends

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
having an authentic social moment

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
and screwing around together.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
It should feel familiar and kind of resonate

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
for anyone who's had a sing-a-long or a dance party

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
with a group of good friends.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
LL: Or ...

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
JS: So that's importantly different from the earlier videos we looked at

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
because here, remix isn't just about

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
an individual doing something alone in his basement;

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
it becomes an act of social creativity.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
And it's not just that it yields

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
a different kind of product at the end,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
it's that potentially it changes the way that we relate to each other.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
All of our normal social interactions

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
become a kind of invitation

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
to this sort of collective expression.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
It's our real social lives themselves

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
that are transmuted into art.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
LL: And so then, what this libertarian draws from these two points ...

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
JS: One remix is about

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
individuals using our shared culture

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
as a kind of language to communicate something to an audience.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Stage two, social remix,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
is really about using it to mediate

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
people's relationships to each other.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
First, within each video,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
the Brat Pack characters are used as a kind of template

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
for performing the social reality of each group.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
But there's also a dialogue between the videos,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
where, once the basic structure is established,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
it becomes a kind of platform

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
for articulating the similarities and differences

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
between the groups' social and physical worlds.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
LL: And then, here's for me,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
the critical key to what

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Julian has to say ...

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
JS: Copyright policy isn't just about

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
how to incentivize the production

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
of a certain kind of artistic commodity;

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
it's about what level of control

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
we're going to permit to be exercised

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
over our social realities --

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
social realities that are now inevitably

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
permeated by pop culture.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
I think it's important that we

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
keep these two different kinds of public goods in mind.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
If we're only focused on how to maximize

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
the supply of one,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
I think we risk suppressing

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
this different and richer

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
and, in some ways, maybe even more important one.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
LL: Right. Bingo. Point.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Freedom needs this opportunity

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
to both have the commercial success

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
of the great commercial works

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
and the opportunity

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
to build this different kind of culture.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
And for that to happen, you need

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
ideas like fair use to be central and protected,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
to enable this kind of innovation,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
as this libertarian tells us,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
between these two creative cultures,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
a commercial and a sharing culture.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
The point is they, he, here,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
gets that culture.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Now, my concern is, we Dems,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
too often, not so much.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
All right, take for example this great company.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
In the good old days when this Republican ran that company,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
their greatest work was work that built on the past, right.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
All of the great Disney works

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
were works that took works that

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
were in the public domain and remixed them,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
or waited until they entered the public domain to remix them,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
to celebrate this add-on remix creativity.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Indeed, Mickey Mouse himself, of course,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
as "Steamboat Willie,"

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
is a remix of the then, very dominant,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
very popular "Steamboat Bill"

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
by Buster Keaton.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
This man was a remixer extraordinaire.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
He is the celebration and ideal

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
of exactly this kind of creativity.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
But then the company passes

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
through this dark stage

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
to this Democrat.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Wildly different.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
This is the mastermind behind

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
the eventual passage of what we call

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
extending the term of existing copyrights

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
by 20 years,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
so that no one could do to Disney

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
what Disney did to the Brothers Grimm.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Now, when we tried to challenge this,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
going to the Supreme Court, getting the Supreme Court, the bunch of conservatives there --

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
if we could get them to wake up to this -- to strike it down,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
we had the assistance of Nobel Prize winners

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
including this right-wing

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Nobel Prize winner, Milton Friedman,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
who said he would join our brief

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
only if the word "no brainer"

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
was in the brief somewhere.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
(Laughter)

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
But apparently, no brains

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
existed in this place

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
when Democrats passed and signed

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
this bill into law.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Now, tiny little quibble of a footnote:

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Sonny Bono, you might say, was a Republican,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
but I don't buy it.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
This guy is no Republican.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
Okay, for a second example,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
think about this cultural hero,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
icon on the Left,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
creator of this character.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Look at the site that he built: "Star Wars" MashUps,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
inviting people to come and use their creative energy

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
to produce a new generation of attention

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
towards this extraordinarily important cultural icon.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Read the license.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
The license for these remixers

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
assigns all of the rights

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
to the remix back to Lucas.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
The mashup is owned by Lucas.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Indeed, anything you add to the mashup,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
music you might add,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Lucas has a worldwide perpetual right

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
to exploit that for free.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
There is no creator here to be recognized.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
The creator doesn't have any rights.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
The creator is a sharecropper in this story.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
And we should remember

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
who employed the sharecroppers:

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
the Democrats, right?

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
So the point is the Republicans here

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
recognize that there's a certain need

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
of ownership,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
a respect for ownership,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
the respect we should give the creator,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
the remixer, the owner, the property owner,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
the copyright owner

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
of this extraordinarily powerful stuff,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000
and not a generation of sharecroppers.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Now, I think there are lessons we should learn here,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
lessons about openness.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Our lives are sharing activities,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
at least in part.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Even for the head of Goldman Sachs,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
at least in part.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
And for that sharing activity to happen, we have to have

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
well-protected spaces of fair use.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
That's number one. Number two:

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
This ecology of sharing

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
needs freedom

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
within which to create.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Freedom, which means without permission from anyone,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
the ability to create.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
And number three: We need to

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
respect the creator,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
the creator of these remixes

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
through rights that are

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
directly tied to them.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Now, this explains the right-wing nonprofit

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Creative Commons.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Actually, it's not a right-wing nonprofit,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
but of course -- let me just tie it here --

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
the Creative Commons, which is

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
offering authors this simple way to mark their content

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
with the freedoms

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
they intended to carry.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
So that we go from a "all rights reserved" world

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
to a "some rights reserved" world

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
so that people can know the freedoms they have attached to the content,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
building and creating

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
on the basis of this

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
creative copyrighted work.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
These tools that we built

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
enable this sharing in parts

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
through licenses that make it clear

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
and a freedom to create

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
without requiring permission first

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
because the permission has already been granted

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
and a respect for the creator because it builds upon

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
a copyright the creator

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
has licensed freely.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
And it explains the vast right-wing conspiracy

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
that's obviously developed around these licenses,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
as now more than 350 million digital objects

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
are out there, licensed freely

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
in this way.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Now that picture of an ecology of creativity,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
the picture of an ecology

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
of balanced creativity,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
is that the ecology of creativity we have right now?

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Well, as you all know,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
not many of us believe we do.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
I tripped on the reality of this ecology of creativity

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
just last week.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
I created a video which was based

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
on a Wireside Chat that I'd given,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
and I uploaded it to YouTube.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
I then got this email from YouTube

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
weirdly notifying me

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
that there was content in that

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
owned by the mysterious WMG

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
that matched their content ID.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
So I didn't think much about it.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
And then on Twitter, somebody said to me,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
"Your talk on YouTube was DMCA'd. Was that your purpose?"

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
imagining that I had this deep conspiracy

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
to reveal the obvious flaws in the DMCA.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
I answered, "No." I didn't even think about it.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
But then I went to the site

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
and all of the audio in my site had been silenced.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
My whole 45-minute video

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
had been silenced

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
because there were snippets in that video,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
a video about fair use,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
that included Warner Music Group music.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Now, interestingly,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
they still sold ads for that music,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
if you played the silent video.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
You could still buy the music,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
but you couldn't hear anything

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
because it had been silenced.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
So I did what the current regime

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
says I must do

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
to be free to use

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
YouTube to talk about fair use.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
I went to this site, and I had to answer these questions.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
And then in an extraordinarily

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Bart Simpson-like, juvenile way

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
you've actually got to type out these words

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
and get them right

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
to reassert your freedom to speak.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
And I felt like I was in third grade again.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
"I will not put tacks on the teacher's chair.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
I will not put tacks on the teacher's chair."

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
This is absurd.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
It is outrageous.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
It is an extraordinary perversion of the system of freedom

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
we should be encouraging.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
And the question I ask you is: Who's fighting it?

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Well, interestingly, in the last presidential election,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
who was the number one, active

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
opponent of this system of regulation

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
in online speech?

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
John McCain.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Letter after letter attacking YouTube's refusal

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
to be more respectful of fair use

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
with their extraordinary notice and take down system,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
that led his campaign so many times

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
to be thrown off the Internet.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
Now, that was the story of me then,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
my good old days of right-wing lunacy.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Let me come back to now,

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
now when I'm a little leftist --

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
I'm certainly left-handed, so at least a lefty --

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
And I wonder, can we on the Left

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
expect to build this

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
ecology of freedom, now,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
in a world where

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
we know the extraordinarily powerful

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
influences against it,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
where even icons of the Left like this

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
entertain and push bills

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
that would effectively ban the requirement

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
of open access for government-funded research?

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
The president, who has supported

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
a process that secretly negotiates agreements,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
which effectively lock us into the insane system

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
of DMCA

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
that we have adopted

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
and likely lock us down a path of three strikes, you're out

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
that, of course, the rest of the world are increasingly adopting.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
Not a single example of reform

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
has been produced yet.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
And we're not going to see this change

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
in this system

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
anytime soon.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
So here's the lessons of openness

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
that I think we need to learn.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Openness is a commitment

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
to a certain set of values.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
We need to speak of those values.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
The value of freedom. It's a value of community.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
It's a value of the limits in regulation.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
It's a value respecting the creator.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Now, if we can learn those values

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
from at least some influences on the Right,

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
if we can take them and incorporate them,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
maybe we could do a little trade.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
We learn those values on the Left,

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
and maybe they'll do health care

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
or global warming legislation or something in the Right.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Anyway, please join me

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
in teaching these values.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Thank you very much.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
