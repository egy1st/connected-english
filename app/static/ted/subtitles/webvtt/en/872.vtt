00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
We're 25, 26 years after

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
the advent of the Macintosh,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
which was an astoundingly seminal event

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
in the history

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
of human-machine interface

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and in computation in general.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
It fundamentally changed the way

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that people thought about computation,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
thought about computers,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
how they used them and who and how many people were able to use them.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It was such a radical change, in fact,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
that the early Macintosh development team

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
in '82, '83, '84

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
had to write an entirely new operating system from the ground up.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Now, this is an interesting little message,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and it's a lesson that has since, I think,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
been forgotten or lost or something,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and that is, namely, that the OS is the interface.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The interface is the OS.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It's like the land and the king (i.e. Arthur) they're inseparable, they are one.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And to write a new operating system was not a capricious matter.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
It wasn't just a matter of tuning up some graphics routines.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
There were no graphics routines. There were no mouse drivers.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So it was a necessity.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
But in the quarter-century since then,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
we've seen all of the fundamental

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
supporting technologies go berserk.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So memory capacity and disk capacity

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
have been multiplied by something between 10,000 and a million.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Same thing for processor speeds.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Networks, we didn't have networks at all

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
at the time of the Macintosh's introduction,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and that has become the single most salient aspect

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
of how we live with computers.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And, of course, graphics: Today

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
84 dollars and 97 cents at Best Buy

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
buys you more graphics power

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
than you could have gotten for a million bucks from SGI only a decade ago.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So we've got that incredible ramp-up.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Then, on the side, we've got the Web

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and, increasingly, the cloud,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
which is fantastic,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
but also -- in the regard in which an interface is fundamental --

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
kind of a distraction.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
So we've forgotten to invent new interfaces.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Certainly we've seen in recent years a lot of change in that regard,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and people are starting to wake up about that.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
So what happens next? Where do we go from there?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
The problem, as we see it,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
has to do with a single, simple word: "space,"

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
or a single, simple phrase:

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
"real world geometry."

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Computers and the programming languages

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
that we talk to them in, that we teach them in,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
are hideously insensate when it comes to space.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
They don't understand real world space.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
It's a funny thing because the rest of us occupy it quite frequently and quite well.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
They also don't understand time, but that's a matter for a separate talk.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
So what happens if you start to

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
explain space to them?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
One thing you might get is something like the Luminous Room.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
The Luminous Room is a system

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
in which it's considered that

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
input and output spaces are co-located.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
That's a strangely simple,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
and yet unexplored idea, right?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
When you use a mouse, your hand is down here on the mouse pad.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
It's not even on the same plane as what you're talking about:

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
The pixels are up on the display.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
So here was a room in which all the walls, floors, ceilings,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
pets, potted plants, whatever was in there,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
were capable, not only of display but of sensing as well.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And that means input and output are in the same space

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
enabling stuff like this.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
That's a digital storage in a physical container.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
The contract is the same

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
as with real word objects in real world containers.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Has to come back out, whatever you put in.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
This little design experiment

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
that was a small office here knew a few other tricks as well.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
If you presented it with a chess board,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
it tried to figure out what you might mean by that.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And if there was nothing for them to do,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
the chess pieces eventually got bored

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
and hopped away.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
The academics who were overseeing this work

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
thought that that was too frivolous,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
so we built deadly serious applications

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
like this optics prototyping workbench

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
in which a toothpaste cap on a cardboard box

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
becomes a laser.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
The beam splitters and lenses are represented by physical objects,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
and the system projects down the laser beam path.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
So you've got an interface that has no interface.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
You operate the world as you operate the real world,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
which is to say, with your hands.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Similarly, a digital wind tunnel with digital wind

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
flowing from right to left --

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
not that remarkable in a sense; we didn't invent the mathematics.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
But if you displayed that on a CRT or flat panel display,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
it would be meaningless to hold up an arbitrary object,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
a real world object in that.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Here, the real world merges with the simulation.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And finally, to pull out all the stops,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
this is a system called Urp, for urban planners,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
in which we give architects and urban planners back

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
the models that we confiscated

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
when we insisted that they use CAD systems.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And we make the machine meet them half way.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
It projects down digital shadows, as you see here.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
And if you introduce tools like this inverse clock,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
then you can control the sun's position in the sky.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
That's 8 a.m. shadows.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
They get a little shorter at 9 a.m.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
There you are, swinging the sun around.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Short shadows at noon and so forth.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
And we built up a series of tools like this.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
There are inter-shadowing studies

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
that children can operate,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
even though they don't know anything about urban planning:

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
To move a building, you simply reach out your hand and you move the building.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
A material wand makes the building

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
into a sort of Frank Gehry thing that reflects light in all directions.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Are you blinding passers by and motorists on the freeways?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
A zoning tool connects distant structures, a building and a roadway.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Are you going to get sued by the zoning commission? And so forth.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Now, if these ideas seem familiar

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
or perhaps even a little dated,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
that's great; they should seem familiar.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
This work is 15 years old.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
This stuff was undertaken at MIT and the Media Lab

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
under the incredible direction of Professor Hiroshi Ishii,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
director of the Tangible Media Group.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
But it was that work that was seen

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
by Alex McDowell,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
one of the world's legendary production designers.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
But Alex was preparing a little, sort of obscure, indie, arthouse film

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
called "Minority Report" for Steven Spielberg,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
and invited us to come out from MIT

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
and design the interfaces

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
that would appear in that film.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
And the great thing about it was

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
that Alex was so dedicated to the idea of verisimilitude,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
the idea that the putative 2054

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
that we were painting in the film be believable,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
that he allowed us to take on that design work

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
as if it were an R&amp;D effort.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
And the result is sort of

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
gratifyingly perpetual.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
People still reference those sequences in "Minority Report"

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
when they talk about new UI design.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
So this led full circle, in a strange way,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
to build these ideas into what we believe

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
is the necessary future of human machine interface:

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
the Spatial Operating Environment, we call it.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
So here we have a bunch of stuff, some images.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
And, using a hand,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
we can actually exercise six degrees of freedom,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
six degrees of navigational control.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
And it's fun to fly through Mr. Beckett's eye.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
And you can come back out

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
through the scary orangutan.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And that's all well and good.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Let's do something a little more difficult.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Here, we have a whole bunch of disparate images.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
We can fly around them.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
So navigation is a fundamental issue.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
You have to be able to navigate in 3D.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Much of what we want computers to help us with in the first place

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
is inherently spatial.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
And the part that isn't spatial can often be spatialized

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
to allow our wetware to make greater sense of it.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Now we can distribute this stuff in many different ways.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
So we can throw it out like that. Let's reset it.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
We can organize it this way.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
And, of course, it's not just about navigation,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
but about manipulation as well.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
So if we don't like stuff,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
or we're intensely curious about

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Ernst Haeckel's scientific falsifications,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
we can pull them out like that.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
And then if it's time for analysis, we can pull back a little bit

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
and ask for a different distribution.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Let's just come down a bit

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
and fly around.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
So that's a different way to look at stuff.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
If you're of a more analytical nature

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
then you might want, actually, to look at this

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
as a color histogram.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
So now we've got the stuff color-sorted,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
angle maps onto color.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
And now, if we want to select stuff,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
3D, space,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
the idea that we're tracking hands in real space

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
becomes really important because we can reach in,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
not in 2D, not in fake 2D, but in actual 3D.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Here are some selection planes.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
And we'll perform this Boolean operation

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
because we really love yellow and tapirs on green grass.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
So, from there to the world of real work.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Here's a logistics system,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
a small piece of one that we're currently building.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
There're a lot of elements.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
And one thing that's very important is to combine traditional tabular data

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
with three-dimensional and geospatial information.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
So here's a familiar place.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And we'll bring this back here for a second.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Maybe select a little bit of that.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
And bring out this graph.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
And we should, now,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
be able to fly in here

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
and have a closer look.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
These are logistics elements

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
that are scattered across the United States.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
One thing that three-dimensional interactions

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
and the general idea of imbuing

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
computation with space affords you

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
is a final destruction of that unfortunate

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
one-to-one pairing between human beings and computers.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
That's the old way, that's the old mantra:

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
one machine, one human, one mouse, one screen.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Well, that doesn't really cut it anymore.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
In the real world, we have people who collaborate;

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
we have people who have to work together,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
and we have many different displays.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
And we might want to look at these various images.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
We might want to ask for some help.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
The author of this new pointing device

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
is sitting over there,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
so I can pull this from there to there.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
These are unrelated machines, right?

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
So the computation is space soluble and network soluble.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
So I'm going to leave that over there

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
because I have a question for Paul.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Paul is the designer of this wand, and maybe its easiest

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
for him to come over here and tell me in person what's going on.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
So let me get some of these out of the way.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Let's pull this apart:

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
I'll go ahead and explode it.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Kevin, can you help?

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Let me see if I can help us find the circuit board.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Mind you, it's a sort of gratuitous field-stripping exercise,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
but we do it in the lab all the time.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
All right.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
So collaborative work, whether it's immediately co-located

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
or distant and distinct, is always important.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
And again, that stuff

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
needs to be undertaken in the context of space.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
And finally, I'd like to leave you with a glimpse

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
that takes us back to the world of imagery.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
This is a system called TAMPER,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
which is a slightly whimsical look

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
at what the future of editing

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
and media manipulation systems might be.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
We at Oblong believe that media should be

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
accessible in much more fine-grained form.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
So we have a large number of movies

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
stuck inside here.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
And let's just pick out a few elements.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
We can zip through them

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
as a possibility.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
We can grab elements off the front,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
where upon they reanimate, come to life,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
and drag them down onto the table here.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
We'll go over to Jacques Tati here

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
and grab our blue friend

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
and put him down on the table as well.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
We may need more than one.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
And we probably need,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
well, we probably need a cowboy

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
to be quite honest.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
(Laughter)

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Yeah, let's

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
take that one.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
(Laughter)

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
You see, cowboys and French farce people

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
don't go well together, and the system knows that.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Let me leave with one final thought,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
and that is that

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
one of the greatest English language writers

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
of the last three decades

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
suggested that great art is always a gift.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
And he wasn't talking about whether the novel costs 24.95 [dollars],

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
or whether you have to spring 70 million bucks

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
to buy the stolen Vermeer;

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
he was talking about the circumstances of its creation

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
and of its existence.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
And I think that it's time that we asked

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
for the same from technology.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Technology is capable of

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
expressing and being imbued with

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
a certain generosity,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
and we need to demand that, in fact.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
For some of this kind of technology,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
ground center is

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
a combination of design, which is crucially important.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
We can't have advances in technology any longer

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
unless design is integrated from the very start.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
And, as well, as of efficacy, agency.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
We're, as human beings, the creatures that create,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
and we should make sure that our machines aid us in that task

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
and are built in that same image.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
So I will leave you with that. Thank you.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:16.000
(Applause)

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Chris Anderson: So to ask the obvious question --

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
actually this is from Bill Gates --

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
when? (John Underkoffler: When?)

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
CA: When real? When for us, not just in a lab and on a stage?

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Can it be for every man, or is this just for corporations and movie producers?

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
JU: No, it has to be for every human being.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
That's our goal entirely.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
We won't have succeeded

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
unless we take that next big step.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
I mean it's been 25 years.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Can there really be only one interface? There can't.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
CA: But does that mean that, at your desk or in your home,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
you need projectors, cameras?

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
You know, how can it work?

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
JU: No, this stuff will be built into the bezel of every display.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
It'll be built into architecture.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
The gloves go away in a matter of months or years.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
So this is the inevitability about it.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
CA: So, in your mind, five years time,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
someone can buy this as part of

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
a standard computer interface?

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
JU: I think in five years time when you buy a computer,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
you'll get this.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
CA: Well that's cool.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
(Applause)

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
The world has a habit of surprising us as to how these things are actually used.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
What do you think, what in your mind is the first killer app for this?

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
JU: That's a good question, and we ask ourselves that every day.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
At the moment, our early-adopter customers --

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
and these systems are deployed out in the real world --

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
do all the big data intensive, data heavy problems with it.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
So, whether it's logistics and supply chain management

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
or natural gas and resource extraction,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
financial services, pharmaceuticals, bioinformatics,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
those are the topics right now, but that's not a killer app.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
And I understand what you're asking.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
CA: C'mon, c'mon. Martial arts, games. C'mon.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
(Laughter)

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
John, thank you for making science-fiction real.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
JU: It's been a great pleasure.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
Thank you to you all.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
(Applause)
