00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I would like to share with you this morning

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
some stories about the ocean

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
through my work as a still photographer

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
for National Geographic magazine.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I guess I became an underwater photographer

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and a photojournalist

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
because I fell in love with the sea as a child.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And I wanted to tell stories

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
about all the amazing things I was seeing underwater,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
incredible wildlife and interesting behaviors.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And after even 30 years of doing this,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
after 30 years of exploring the ocean,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I never cease to be amazed

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
at the extraordinary encounters that I have while I'm at sea.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
But more and more frequently these days

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I'm seeing terrible things underwater as well,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
things that I don't think most people realize.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And I've been compelled to turn my camera towards these issues

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
to tell a more complete story.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
I want people to see what's happening underwater,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
both the horror and the magic.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The first story that I did for National Geographic,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
where I recognized the ability to include

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
environmental issues within a natural history coverage,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
was a story I proposed on harp seals.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The story I wanted to do initially

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
was just a small focus to look at the few weeks each year

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
where these animals migrate down from the Canadian arctic

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
to the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Canada

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
to engage in courtship, mating and to have their pups.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And all of this is played out against

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
the backdrop of transient pack ice

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
that moves with wind and tide.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And because I'm an underwater photographer,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I wanted to do this story from both above and below,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
to make pictures like this that show one of these little pups

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
making its very first swim in the icy 29-degree water.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
But as I got more involved in the story,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I realized that there were two big environmental issues I couldn't ignore.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
The first was that these animals continue to be hunted,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
killed with hakapiks at about eight, 15 days old.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
It actually is the largest marine mammal

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
slaughter on the planet,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
with hundreds of thousands of these seals being killed every year.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
But as disturbing as that is,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I think the bigger problem for harp seals

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
is the loss of sea ice due to global warming.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
This is an aerial picture that I made that shows

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
the Gulf of St. Lawrence during harp seal season.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And even though we see a lot of ice in this picture,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
there's a lot of water as well, which wasn't there historically.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And the ice that is there is quite thin.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
The problem is that these pups need a stable platform of solid ice

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
in order to nurse from their moms.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
They only need 12 days from the moment they're born until they're on their own.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
But if they don't get 12 days,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
they can fall into the ocean and die.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
This is a photo that I made showing

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
one of these pups that's only about five or seven days old --

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
still has a little bit of the umbilical cord on its belly --

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
that has fallen in because of the thin ice,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and the mother is frantically trying to push it up to breathe

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and to get it back to stable purchase.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
This problem has continued to grow each year since I was there.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I read that last year the pup mortality rate

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
was 100 percent in parts of the Gulf of St. Lawrence.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
So, clearly, this species has a lot of problems going forward.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
This ended up becoming a cover story at National Geographic.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And it received quite a bit of attention.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And with that, I saw the potential to begin

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
doing other stories about ocean problems.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
So I proposed a story on the global fish crisis,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
in part because I had personally witnessed

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
a lot of degradation in the ocean over the last 30 years,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
but also because I read a scientific paper

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
that stated that 90 percent of the big fish in the ocean

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
have disappeared in the last 50 or 60 years.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
These are the tuna, the billfish and the sharks.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
When I read that, I was blown away by those numbers.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
I thought this was going to be headline news in every media outlet,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
but it really wasn't, so I wanted to do a story

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
that was a very different kind of underwater story.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
I wanted it to be more like war photography,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
where I was making harder-hitting pictures

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
that showed readers what was happening

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
to marine wildlife around the planet.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
The first component of the story that I thought was essential, however,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
was to give readers a sense of appreciation

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
for the ocean animals that they were eating.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
You know, I think people go into a restaurant,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and somebody orders a steak, and we all know where steak comes from,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and somebody orders a chicken, and we know what a chicken is,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
but when they're eating bluefin sushi,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
do they have any sense of the magnificent animal that they're consuming?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
These are the lions and tigers of the sea.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
In reality, these animals have no terrestrial counterpart;

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
they're unique in the world.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
These are animals that can practically swim

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
from the equator to the poles

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
and can crisscross entire oceans in the course of a year.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
If we weren't so efficient at catching them, because they grow their entire life,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
would have 30-year-old bluefin out there that weigh a ton.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
But the truth is we're way too efficient at catching them,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
and their stocks have collapsed worldwide.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
This is the daily auction at the Tsukiji Fish Market

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
that I photographed a couple years ago.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And every single day these tuna, bluefin like this,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
are stacked up like cordwood,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
just warehouse after warehouse.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
As I wandered around and made these pictures,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
it sort of occurred to me that the ocean's not a grocery store, you know.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
We can't keep taking without expecting

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
serious consequences as a result.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
I also, with the story, wanted to show readers

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
how fish are caught, some of the methods that are used to catch fish,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
like a bottom trawler, which is one of the most common methods in the world.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
This was a small net that was being used in Mexico to catch shrimp,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
but the way it works is essentially the same everywhere in the world.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
You have a large net in the middle

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
with two steel doors on either end.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And as this assembly is towed through the water,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
the doors meet resistance with the ocean,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
and it opens the mouth of the net,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
and they place floats at the top and a lead line on the bottom.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And this just drags over the bottom, in this case to catch shrimp.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
But as you can imagine, it's catching everything else in its path as well.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
And it's destroying that precious benthic community on the bottom,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
things like sponges and corals,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
that critical habitat for other animals.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
This photograph I made of the fisherman

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
holding the shrimp that he caught after towing his nets for one hour.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
So he had a handful of shrimp, maybe seven or eight shrimp,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
and all those other animals on the deck of the boat are bycatch.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
These are animals that died in the process,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
but have no commercial value.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
So this is the true cost of a shrimp dinner,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
maybe seven or eight shrimp

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
and 10 pounds of other animals that had to die in the process.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And to make that point even more visual, I swam under the shrimp boat

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
and made this picture of the guy shoveling

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
this bycatch into the sea as trash

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
and photographed this cascade of death,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
you know, animals like guitarfish, bat rays,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
flounder, pufferfish, that only an hour before,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
were on the bottom of the ocean, alive,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
but now being thrown back as trash.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
I also wanted to focus on the shark fishing industry

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
because, currently on planet Earth,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
we're killing over 100 million sharks

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
every single year.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
But before I went out to photograph this component,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
I sort of wrestled with the notion of how do you make a picture of a dead shark

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
that will resonate with readers

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
You know, I think there's still a lot of people out there who think

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
the only good shark is a dead shark.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
But this one morning I jumped in and found this thresher

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
that had just recently died in the gill net.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
And with its huge pectoral fins and eyes still very visible,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
it struck me as sort of a crucifixion, if you will.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
This ended up being the lead picture

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
in the global fishery story in National Geographic.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
And I hope that it helped readers to take notice

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
of this problem of 100 million sharks.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
And because I love sharks -- I'm somewhat obsessed with sharks --

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
I wanted to do another, more celebratory, story about sharks,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
as a way of talking about the need for shark conservation.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
So I went to the Bahamas

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
because there're very few places in the world

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
where sharks are doing well these days,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
but the Bahamas seem to be a place where stocks were reasonably healthy,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
largely due to the fact that the government there

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
had outlawed longlining several years ago.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
And I wanted to show several species

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
that we hadn't shown much in the magazine and worked in a number of locations.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
One of the locations was this place called Tiger Beach,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
in the northern Bahamas where tiger sharks

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
aggregate in shallow water.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
This is a low-altitude photograph that I made

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
showing our dive boat with about a dozen of these big old tiger sharks

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
sort of just swimming around behind.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
But the one thing I definitely didn't want to do with this coverage

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
was to continue to portray sharks as something like monsters.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
I didn't want them to be overly threatening or scary.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
And with this photograph of a beautiful

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
15-feet, probably 14-feet, I guess,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
female tiger shark,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
I sort of think I got to that goal,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
where she was swimming with these little barjacks off her nose,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
and my strobe created a shadow on her face.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And I think it's a gentler picture, a little less threatening,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
a little more respectful of the species.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
I also searched on this story

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
for the elusive great hammerhead,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
an animal that really hadn't been photographed much

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
until maybe about seven or 10 years ago.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
It's a very solitary creature.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
But this is an animal that's considered data deficient by science

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
in both Florida and in the Bahamas.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
You know, we know almost nothing about them.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
We don't know where they migrate to or from,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
where they mate, where they have their pups,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
and yet, hammerhead populations in the Atlantic

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
have declined about 80 percent in the last 20 to 30 years.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
You know, we're losing them faster than we can possibly find them.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
This is the oceanic whitetip shark,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
an animal that is considered the fourth most dangerous species,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
if you pay attention to such lists.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
But it's an animal that's about 98 percent in decline

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
throughout most of its range.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Because this is a pelagic animal and it lives out in the deeper water,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
and because we weren't working on the bottom,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
I brought along a shark cage here,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
and my friend, shark biologist Wes Pratt is inside the cage.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
You'll see that the photographer, of course, was not inside the cage here,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
so clearly the biologist is a little smarter than the photographer I guess.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
And lastly with this story,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
I also wanted to focus on baby sharks, shark nurseries.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
And I went to the island of Bimini, in the Bahamas,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
to work with lemon shark pups.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
This is a photo of a lemon shark pup,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
and it shows these animals where they live for the first two to three years of their lives

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
in these protective mangroves.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
This is a very sort of un-shark-like photograph.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
It's not what you typically might think of as a shark picture.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
But, you know, here we see a shark that's maybe 10 or 11 inches long

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
swimming in about a foot of water.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
But this is crucial habitat and it's where they spend the first two, three years of their lives,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
until they're big enough to go out on the rest of the reef.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
After I left Bimini, I actually learned

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
that this habitat was being bulldozed

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
to create a new golf course and resort.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
And other recent stories have looked at

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
single, flagship species, if you will,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
that are at risk in the ocean

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
as a way of talking about other threats.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
One such story I did documented the leatherback sea turtle.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
This is the largest, widest-ranging,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
deepest-diving and oldest of all turtle species.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Here we see a female crawling

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
out of the ocean under moonlight

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
on the island of Trinidad.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
These are animals whose lineage dates back about 100 million years.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
And there was a time in their lifespan

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
where they were coming out of the water to nest

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
and saw Tyrannosaurus rex running by.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
And today, they crawl out and see condominiums.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
But despite this amazing longevity,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
they're now considered critically endangered.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
In the Pacific, where I made this photograph,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
their stocks have declined about 90 percent

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
in the last 15 years.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
This is a photograph that shows a hatchling

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
about to taste saltwater for the very first time

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
beginning this long and perilous journey.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Only one in a thousand

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
leatherback hatchlings will reach maturity.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
But that's due to natural predators

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
like vultures that pick them off on a beach

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
or predatory fish that are waiting offshore.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Nature has learned to compensate with that,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
and females have multiple clutches of eggs

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
to overcome those odds.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
But what they can't deal with is anthropogenic stresses,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
human things, like this picture that shows

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
a leatherback caught at night in a gill net.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
I actually jumped in and photographed this,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
and with the fisherman's permission,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
I cut the turtle out, and it was able to swim free.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
But, you know, thousands of other leatherbacks each year

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
are not so fortunate,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
and the species' future is in great danger.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Another charismatic megafauna species that I worked with

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
is the story I did on the right whale.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
And essentially, the story is this with right whales,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
that about a million years ago, there was

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
one species of right whale on the planet,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
but as land masses moved around and oceans became isolated,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
the species sort of separated,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
and today we have essentially two distinct stocks.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
We have the Southern right whale that we see here

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
and the North Atlantic right whale that we see here

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
with a mom and calf off the coast of Florida.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Now, both species were hunted to the brink of extinction

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
by the early whalers,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
but the Southern right whales have rebounded a lot better

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
because they're located in places

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
farther away from human activity.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
The North Atlantic right whale is listed as

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
the most endangered species on the planet today

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
because they are urban whales; they live along the east coast

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
of North America, United States and Canada,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
and they have to deal with all these urban ills.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
This photo shows an animal popping its head out at sunset off the coast of Florida.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
You can see the coal burning plant in the background.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
They have to deal with things like toxins and pharmaceuticals

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
that are flushed out into the ocean,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
and maybe even affecting their reproduction.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
They also get entangled in fishing gear.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
This is a picture that shows the tail of a right whale.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
And those white markings are not natural markings.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
These are entanglement scars.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
72 percent of the population has such scars,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
but most don't shed the gear, things like lobster traps and crab pots.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
They hold on to them, and it eventually kills them.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And the other problem is they get hit by ships.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
And this was an animal that was struck by a ship

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
in Nova Scotia, Canada

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
being towed in, where they did a necropsy

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
to confirm the cause of death,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
which was indeed a ship strike.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
So all of these ills are stacking up against these animals

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
and keeping their numbers very low.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
And to draw a contrast with that beleaguered North Atlantic population,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
I went to a new pristine population of Southern right whales

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
that had only been discovered about 10 years ago

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
in the sub-Antarctic of New Zealand, a place called the Auckland Islands.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
I went down there in the winter time.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
And these are animals that had never seen humans before,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
and I was one of the first people they probably had ever seen.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
And I got in the water with them,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
and I was amazed at how curious they were.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
This photograph shows my assistant standing on the bottom at about 70 feet

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
and one of these amazingly beautiful, 45-foot,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
70-ton whales,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
like a city bus just swimming up, you know.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
They were in perfect condition,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
very fat and healthy, robust, no entanglement scars,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
the way they're supposed to look.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
You know, I read that the pilgrims, when they landed at Plymouth Rock

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
in Massachusetts in 1620,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
wrote that you could walk across Cape Cod Bay

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
on the backs of right whales.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
And we can't go back and see that today,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
but maybe we can preserve what we have left.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
And I wanted to close this program with a story of hope,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
a story I did on marine reserves

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
as sort of a solution

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
to the problem of overfishing, the global fish crisis story.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
I settled on working in the country of New Zealand

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
because New Zealand was rather progressive,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
and is rather progressive in terms of protecting their ocean.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
And I really wanted this story to be about three things:

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
I wanted it to be about abundance,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
about diversity and about resilience.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
And one of the first places I worked

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
was a reserve called Goat Island

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
in Leigh of New Zealand.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
What the scientists there told me was that

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
when protected this first marine reserve in 1975,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
they hoped and expected that certain things might happen.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
For example, they hoped that certain species of fish

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
like the New Zealand snapper would return

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
because they had been fished to the brink of commercial extinction.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
And they did come back. What they couldn't predict was that other things would happen.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
For example, these fish

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
predate on sea urchins,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
and when the fish were all gone,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
all anyone ever saw underwater

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
was just acres and acres of sea urchins.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
But when the fish came back

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
and began predating and controlling the urchin population,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
low and behold, kelp forests emerged in shallow water.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
And that's because the urchins eat kelp.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
So when the fish control the urchin population,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
the ocean was restored to its natural equilibrium.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
You know, this is probably how the ocean looked here

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
one or 200 years ago, but nobody was around to tell us.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
I worked in other parts of New Zealand as well,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
in beautiful, fragile, protected areas

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
like in Fiordland, where this sea pen colony was found.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Little blue cod swimming in for a dash of color.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
In the northern part of New Zealand,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
I dove in the blue water, where the water's a little warmer,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
and photographed animals like this giant sting ray

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
swimming through an underwater canyon.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Every part of the ecosystem in this place

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
seems very healthy,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
from tiny, little animals like a nudibrank

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
crawling over encrusting sponge

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
or a leatherjacket

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
that is a very important animal in this ecosystem

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
because it grazes on the bottom and allows new life to take hold.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
And I wanted to finish with this photograph,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
a picture I made on a very stormy day in New Zealand

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
when I just laid on the bottom

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
amidst a school of fish swirling around me.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
And I was in a place that had only been protected

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
about 20 years ago.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
And I talked to divers that had been diving there for many years,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
and they said that the marine life was better here today

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
than it was in the 1960s.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
And that's because it's been protected,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
that it has come back.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
So I think the message is clear.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
The ocean is, indeed, resilient and tolerant to a point,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
but we must be good custodians.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
I became an underwater photographer

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
because I fell in love with the sea,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
and I make pictures of it today because I want to protect it,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
and I don't think it's too late.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
Thank you very much.
