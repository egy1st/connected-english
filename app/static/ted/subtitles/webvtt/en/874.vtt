00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Tom Green: That's a 4chan thing.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
These kids on the Internet, they have this group of kids

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and they like to say funny words

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
like "barrel roll."

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
It's a video game move from "Star Fox."

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
"Star Fox 20"? (Assistant: "Star Fox 64.")

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Tom Green: Yeah. And they've been dogging me for a year.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I got to tell you, it's driving me nuts, actually.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and I scream,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
"4chan!"

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Christopher Poole: When I was 15,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I found this website called Futaba Channel.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And it was a Japanese forum and imageboard.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
That format of forum, at that time,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
was not well-known outside of Japan.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And so what I did is I took it, I translated it into English,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and I stuck it up for my friends to use.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Now, six and a half years later,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
over seven million people are using it,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
contributing over 700,000 posts per day.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And we've gone from one board

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
to 48 boards.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
This is what it looks like.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
So, what's unique about the site

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
is that it's anonymous,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and it has no memory.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
There's no archive, there are no barriers, there's no registration.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
These things that we're used to with forums

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
don't exist on 4chan.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
And that's led to this

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
discussion that's completely raw, completely unfiltered.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
What the site's known for,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
because it has this environment,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
is it's fostered the creation of a lot of

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Internet phenomena, viral videos and whatnot, known as "memes."

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Two of the largest memes that have come out of this site

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
some of you might be familiar with are these LOLcats --

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
just silly pictures of cats with text.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And this resonates with millions of people, apparently,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
because there are tens of thousands of these,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and there is a whole blogging empire now

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
dedicated to pictures like these.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
And Rick Astley's kind of rebirth

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
these past two years ...

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Rickroll was this bait and switch,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
really simple, classic bait and switch.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Somebody says they're linking to something interesting,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and you get an '80s pop song. That's all it was.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And it got big enough to the point where

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
there was a float last year at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and Rick Astley pops out, and rickrolls

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
millions of people on television.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
(Laughter)

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
There are thousands of memes that come out of the site.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
There are a handful that have escaped into the mainstream,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
the ones I've just shown you,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
but every day, every month,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
people are producing thousands of these.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
So does a site like this have rules?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
We do; they're the codified rules that I've come up with,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
which are more-or-less ignored by the community.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And so they've come up with their own set of rules,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
the "Rules of the Internet."

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And so there are three that I want to show you specifically.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Rule one is you don't talk about /b/.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Two is you do not talk about /b/.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And this one's kind of interesting:

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
"If it exists, there is porn of it. No exceptions."

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
(Laughter)

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And I will spare you that slide.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I assure you, it is very true.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
/b/ is the first board we started with,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and it is, in many ways,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
the beating heart of the website.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
It is where a third of all the traffic is going.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And /b/ is known for,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
more than anything,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
not just the memes they've created, but the exploits.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And Chris just touched on one of those a second ago,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
and that was the Time 100 poll.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
So somebody at Time, at the magazine,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
thought it would be fun to nominate me

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
for this thing they did last year.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And so they placed me on it,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
and the Internet got wind of it. My community

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
decided they wanted me to win it.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
I didn't instruct them to do it; they just decided that that's what they wanted.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And so, you know, 390 percent approval rating ain't so bad.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
(Laughter)

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
So they broke that poll.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And I ended up on top.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
I ended up at this really fancy party.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
But that's not what's interesting about this.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
It's that they weren't putting me at the top of this list;

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
they were actually --

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
it got so sophisticated to the point where they gamed

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
all of the top 21 places

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
to spell "mARBLECAKE. ALSO, THE GAME."

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
(Laughter)

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
The amount of time and effort that went into that

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
is absolutely incredible.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And "marble cake" is significant because

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
it is the channel that this group called Anonymous organized.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Anonymous is this group of people

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
that protested, very famously,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Scientology.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
The story is,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Scientology had this embarrassing video of Tom Cruise. It went up online.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
They got it taken offline and managed to piss off part of the Internet.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
And so these people, over 7,000 people,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
less than one month later,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
organized in a hundred cities around the globe and --

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
this is L.A. --

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
protested the Church of Scientology,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and they have continued to do so,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
now, two full years after the fact.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
They are still protesting.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.000
(Laughter)

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
So we've got this activist group that's this grassroots group

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
that's come out of the site.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And last, I'm going to show you the example,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
the story of Dusty the cat.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Dusty is the name that we've given to this cat.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
This young man

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
posted a video

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
of him abusing his cat on YouTube.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And, you know, this didn't sit well with people,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
and so there was this outpouring of support

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
for people to do something about this.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
So what they did is they -- I mean, they put CSI to shame here --

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
the Internet detectives came out.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
They matched, they found his MySpace.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
They took the YouTube video and they mashed everything in the video.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Within 24 hours,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
they had his name,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
and within 48 hours, he was arrested.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000
(Applause)

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
And so, what I think is really intriguing

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
about a community like 4chan

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
is just that it's this open place.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
As I said, it's raw, it's unfiltered.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
And sites like it are kind of

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
going the way of the dinosaur right now.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
They're endangered because we're moving

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
towards social networking.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
We're moving towards persistent identity.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
We're moving towards,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
you know, a lack of privacy, really.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
We're sacrificing a lot of that, and I think in doing so,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
moving towards those things, we're losing something valuable.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Thank you.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:40.000
(Applause)

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Chris Anderson: Thank you.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Got a couple questions for you.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
But if I ask them, is the TED website going to go down?

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
CP: You're lucky that this is not

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
being streamed to them live right now.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
CA: Well, you never know. Some of them --

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
we've got people in 75 countries out there watching.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Don't tell.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
But seriously,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
this issue on anonymity is --

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
I mean, you made the case there.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
But anonymity basically allows people to say anything,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
all the rules gone.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
You've had to wrestle with issues like child pornography.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
And I'm just curious whether you

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
sometimes lie awake in the night

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
worrying that you've opened Pandora's box.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
CP: Yes and no.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
I mean, for as much good

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
that kind of comes out of this environment,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
there is plenty of bad.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
There are plenty of downsides.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
But I think that the greater good

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
is being served here by just allowing people --

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
there are very few places, now, where you can go

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
and not have identity, to be completely anonymous

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
and say whatever you'd like.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
And saying whatever you like, I think, is powerful.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Doing whatever you like is now crossing a line.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
But I think it's important to have these places.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
When I get emails, people say, "Thank you for giving me this place,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
this outlet, where I can come after work

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
and be myself."

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
CA: But words, saying things,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
you know, can be constructive; it can be really damaging.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
And if you cut the link between what is said

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
and any attribution back to you,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
I mean, surely there are huge risks with that.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
CP: There are, certainly.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
But --

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
CA: Tell me about what -- I mean, I think you asked the board

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
what you might say at TED, right?

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
CP: Yeah, I posted a thread

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
on Sunday.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
And within 24 hours,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
it had over 12,000 responses.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
And the thing is,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
I didn't make it into that presentation

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
because I can't read to you anything that they said, more or less.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
(Laughter)

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
99 percent of it is just,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
would have been, you know, bleeped out.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
But there were some good things that came out of that too.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
(Laughter)

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Love and peace were mentioned.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
CA: Love and peace were mentioned,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
kind of with quote marks around them, right?

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
CP: Cats and dogs were mentioned too.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
CA: And that content is all off the board now.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Right, it's gone? Or is it still up there?

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
CP: I stuck that thread so it lasted a few days.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
It went up to about 16,000 posts,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
and now it has been taken off.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
CA: Okay, well.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Now, I'm not sure I would have necessarily recommended

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
everyone at TED to go and check it out anyway.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Chris, you yourself? I mean, you're a figure of some intrigue.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
You've got this surprising

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
semi-underground influence,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
but it's not making you a lot of money, yet.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
What's the commercial picture here?

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
CP: The commercial picture is that there really isn't

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
much of one, I guess.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
The site has adult content on it.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
I mean, obviously, it's got some very offensive, obscene content on it,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
just in terms of language alone.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
And when you've got that, you've pretty much sacrificed

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
any hope of making lots of money.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
CA: But you still live at home, right?

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
CP: I actually moved out recently.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
CA: That's very cool.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
(Applause)

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
CP: I got out of Mom's, and I'm back in school right now.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
CA: But what conversations did you or do you

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
have with your mother about 4chan?

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
CP: At first, very kind of pained,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
awkward conversations.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
The content is not dinner table conversation in the least.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
But my parents -- I think part of why

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
they kind of are able to appreciate it

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
is because they don't understand it.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
(Laughter)

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
CA: And they were probably pleased to see you

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
on top of the Time poll.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
CP: Yeah. They still didn't know what to think of that though.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
(Laughter)

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
CA: And so, in 10 years' time,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
what do you picture yourself doing?

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
CP: That's a good question.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
As I said, I just went back to school,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
and I am considering

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
majoring in urban studies

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
and then going on to urban planning,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
kind of taking whatever I've learned from online communities

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
and trying to adapt that

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
to a physical community.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
CA: Chris, thank you. Absolutely fascinating. Thank you for coming to TED.
