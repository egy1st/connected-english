WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
We live in difficult and challenging

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
economic times, of course.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And one of the first victims

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
of difficult economic times,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I think, is public spending of any kind,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
but certainly in the firing line at the moment

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
is public spending for science,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and particularly curiosity-led science

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and exploration.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So I want to try and convince you in about 15 minutes

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
that that's a ridiculous

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and ludicrous thing to do.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
But I think to set the scene,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I want to show -- the next slide is not my attempt

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
to show the worst TED slide in the history of TED,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
but it is a bit of a mess.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
(Laughter)

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
But actually, it's not my fault; it's from the Guardian newspaper.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And it's actually a beautiful demonstration

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
of how much science costs.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Because, if I'm going to make the case

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
for continuing to spend on curiosity-driven science and exploration,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I should tell you how much it costs.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So this is a game called "spot the science budgets."

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
This is the U.K. government spend.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
You see there, it's about 620 billion a year.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
The science budget is actually --

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
if you look to your left, there's a purple set of blobs

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and then yellow set of blobs.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And it's one of the yellow set of blobs

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
around the big yellow blob.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
It's about 3.3 billion pounds per year

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
out of 620 billion.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
That funds everything in the U.K.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
from medical research, space exploration,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
where I work, at CERN in Geneva, particle physics,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
engineering, even arts and humanities,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
funded from the science budget,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
which is that 3.3 billion, that little, tiny yellow blob

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
around the orange blob at the top left of the screen.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
So that's what we're arguing about.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
That percentage, by the way, is about the same

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
in the U.S. and Germany and France.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
R&amp;D in total in the economy,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
publicly funded, is about

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
0.6 percent of GDP.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
So that's what we're arguing about.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
The first thing I want to say,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and this is straight from "Wonders of the Solar System,"

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
is that our exploration of the solar system and the universe

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
has shown us that it is indescribably beautiful.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
This is a picture that actually was sent back

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
by the Cassini space probe around Saturn,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
after we'd finished filming "Wonders of the Solar System."

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
So it isn't in the series.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
It's of the moon Enceladus.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
So that big sweeping, white

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
sphere in the corner is Saturn,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
which is actually in the background of the picture.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And that crescent there is the moon Enceladus,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
which is about as big as the British Isles.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
It's about 500 kilometers in diameter.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
So, tiny moon.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
What's fascinating and beautiful ...

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
this an unprocessed picture, by the way, I should say,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
it's black and white, straight from Saturnian orbit.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
What's beautiful is, you can probably see on the limb there

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
some faint, sort of,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
wisps of almost smoke

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
rising up from the limb.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
This is how we visualize that in "Wonders of the Solar System."

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
It's a beautiful graphic.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
What we found out were that those faint wisps

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
are actually fountains of ice

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
rising up from the surface of this tiny moon.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
That's fascinating and beautiful in itself,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
but we think that the mechanism

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
for powering those fountains

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
requires there to be lakes of liquid water

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
beneath the surface of this moon.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And what's important about that

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
is that, on our planet, on Earth,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
wherever we find liquid water,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
we find life.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
So, to find strong evidence

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
of liquid, pools of liquid, beneath the surface of a moon

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
750 million miles away from the Earth

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
is really quite astounding.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
So what we're saying, essentially,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
is maybe that's a habitat for life in the solar system.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Well, let me just say, that was a graphic. I just want to show this picture.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
That's one more picture of Enceladus.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
This is when Cassini flew beneath Enceladus.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
So it made a very low pass,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
just a few hundred kilometers above the surface.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And so this, again, a real picture of the ice fountains rising up into space,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
absolutely beautiful.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
But that's not the prime candidate for life in the solar system.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
That's probably this place,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
which is a moon of Jupiter, Europa.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
And again, we had to fly to the Jovian system

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
to get any sense that this moon, as most moons,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
was anything other than a dead ball of rock.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
It's actually an ice moon.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
So what you're looking at is the surface of the moon Europa,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
which is a thick sheet of ice, probably a hundred kilometers thick.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
But by measuring the way that

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Europa interacts

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
with the magnetic field of Jupiter,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
and looking at how those cracks in the ice

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
that you can see there on that graphic move around,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
we've inferred very strongly

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
that there's an ocean of liquid surrounding

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
the entire surface of Europa.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
So below the ice, there's an ocean of liquid around the whole moon.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
It could be hundreds of kilometers deep, we think.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
We think it's saltwater, and that would mean that

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
there's more water on that moon of Jupiter

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
than there is in all the oceans of the Earth combined.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
So that place, a little moon around Jupiter,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
is probably the prime candidate

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
for finding life on a moon

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
or a body outside the Earth, that we know of.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Tremendous and beautiful discovery.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Our exploration of the solar system

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
has taught us that the solar system is beautiful.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
It may also have pointed the way to answering

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
one of the most profound questions that you can possibly ask,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
which is: "Are we alone in the universe?"

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Is there any other use to exploration and science,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
other than just a sense of wonder?

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Well, there is.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
This is a very famous picture

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
taken, actually, on my first Christmas Eve,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
December 24th, 1968,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
when I was about eight months old.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
It was taken by Apollo 8

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
as it went around the back of the moon.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Earthrise from Apollo 8.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
A famous picture; many people have said that it's the picture

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
that saved 1968,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
which was a turbulent year --

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
the student riots in Paris,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
the height of the Vietnam War.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
The reason many people think that about this picture,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
and Al Gore has said it many times, actually, on the stage at TED,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
is that this picture, arguably, was

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
the beginning of the environmental movement.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Because, for the first time,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
we saw our world,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
not as a solid, immovable,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
kind of indestructible place,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
but as a very small, fragile-looking world

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
just hanging against the blackness of space.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
What's also not often said

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
about the space exploration, about the Apollo program,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
is the economic contribution it made.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
I mean while you can make arguments that it was wonderful

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
and a tremendous achievement

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
and delivered pictures like this,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
it cost a lot, didn't it?

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Well, actually, many studies have been done

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
about the economic effectiveness,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
the economic impact of Apollo.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
The biggest one was in 1975 by Chase Econometrics.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
And it showed that for every $1 spent on Apollo,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
14 came back into the U.S. economy.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
So the Apollo program paid for itself

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
in inspiration,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
in engineering, achievement

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
and, I think, in inspiring young scientists and engineers

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
14 times over.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
So exploration can pay for itself.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
What about scientific discovery?

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
What about driving innovation?

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Well, this looks like a picture of virtually nothing.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
What it is, is a picture of the spectrum

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
of hydrogen.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
See, back in the 1880s, 1890s,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
many scientists, many observers,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
looked at the light given off from atoms.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
And they saw strange pictures like this.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
What you're seeing when you put it through a prism

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
is that you heat hydrogen up and it doesn't just glow

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
like a white light,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
it just emits light at particular colors,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
a red one, a light blue one, some dark blue ones.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Now that led to an understanding of atomic structure

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
because the way that's explained

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
is atoms are a single nucleus

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
with electrons going around them.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
And the electrons can only be in particular places.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
And when they jump up to the next place they can be,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
and fall back down again,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
they emit light at particular colors.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
And so the fact that atoms, when you heat them up,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
only emit light at very specific colors,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
was one of the key drivers

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
that led to the development of the quantum theory,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
the theory of the structure of atoms.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
I just wanted to show this picture because this is remarkable.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
This is actually a picture of the spectrum of the Sun.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
And now, this is a picture of atoms in the Sun's atmosphere

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
absorbing light.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And again, they only absorb light at particular colors

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
when electrons jump up and fall down,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
jump up and fall down.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
But look at the number of black lines in that spectrum.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
And the element helium

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
was discovered just by staring at the light from the Sun

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
because some of those black lines were found

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
that corresponded to no known element.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
And that's why helium's called helium.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
It's called "helios" -- helios from the Sun.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Now, that sounds esoteric,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
and indeed it was an esoteric pursuit,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
but the quantum theory quickly led

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
to an understanding of the behaviors of electrons in materials

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
like silicon, for example.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
The way that silicon behaves,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
the fact that you can build transistors,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
is a purely quantum phenomenon.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
So without that curiosity-driven

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
understanding of the structure of atoms,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
which led to this rather esoteric theory, quantum mechanics,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
then we wouldn't have transistors, we wouldn't have silicon chips,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
we wouldn't have pretty much the basis

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
of our modern economy.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
There's one more, I think, wonderful twist to that tale.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
In "Wonders of the Solar System,"

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
we kept emphasizing the laws of physics are universal.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
It's one of the most incredible things about the physics

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
and the understanding of nature that you get on Earth,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
is you can transport it, not only to the planets,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
but to the most distant stars and galaxies.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
And one of the astonishing predictions

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
of quantum mechanics,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
just by looking at the structure of atoms --

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
the same theory that describes transistors --

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
is that there can be no stars in the universe

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
that have reached the end of their life

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
that are bigger than, quite specifically, 1.4 times the mass of the Sun.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
That's a limit imposed on the mass of stars.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
You can work it out on a piece of paper in a laboratory,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
get a telescope, swing it to the sky,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
and you find that there are no dead stars

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
bigger than 1.4 times the mass of the Sun.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
That's quite an incredible prediction.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
What happens when you have a star that's right on the edge of that mass?

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Well, this is a picture of it.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
This is the picture of a galaxy, a common "our garden" galaxy

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
with, what, 100 billion

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
stars like our Sun in it.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
It's just one of billions of galaxies in the universe.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
There are a billion stars in the galactic core,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
which is why it's shining out so brightly.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
This is about 50 million light years away,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
so one of our neighboring galaxies.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
But that bright star there

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
is actually one of the stars in the galaxy.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
So that star is also

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
50 million light years away.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
It's part of that galaxy, and it's shining as brightly

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
as the center of the galaxy

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
with a billion suns in it.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
That's a Type Ia supernova explosion.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Now that's an incredible phenomena,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
because it's a star that sits there.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
It's called a carbon-oxygen dwarf.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
It sits there about, say, 1.3 times the mass of the Sun.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
And it has a binary companion that goes around it,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
so a big star, a big ball of gas.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
And what it does is it sucks gas

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
off its companion star,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
until it gets to this limit called the Chandrasekhar limit,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
and then it explodes.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
And it explodes, and it shines as brightly

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
as a billion suns for about two weeks,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
and releases, not only energy,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
but a huge amount of chemical elements into the universe.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
In fact, that one is a carbon-oxygen dwarf.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Now, there was no carbon and oxygen

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
in the universe at the Big Bang.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
And there was no carbon and oxygen in the universe

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
throughout the first generation of stars.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
It was made in stars like that,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
locked away and then returned to the universe

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
in explosions like that

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
in order to recondense into planets,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
stars, new solar systems

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
and, indeed, people like us.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
I think that's a remarkable demonstration of the power

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
and beauty and universality of the laws of physics,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
because we understand that process,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
because we understand

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
the structure of atoms here on Earth.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
This is a beautiful quote that I found --

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
we're talking about serendipity there -- from Alexander Fleming:

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
"When I woke up just after dawn

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
on September 28, 1928,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
I certainly didn't plan to revolutionize all medicine

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
by discovering the world's first antibiotic."

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Now, the explorers of the world of the atom

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
did not intend to invent the transistor.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
And they certainly didn't intend to

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
describe the mechanics of supernova explosions,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
which eventually told us where

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
the building blocks of life

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
were synthesized in the universe.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
So, I think science can be --

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
serendipity is important.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
It can be beautiful. It can reveal quite astonishing things.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
It can also, I think, finally

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
reveal the most profound

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
ideas to us

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
about our place in the universe

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
and really the value of our home planet.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
This is a spectacular picture of our home planet.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Now, it doesn't look like our home planet.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
It looks like Saturn because, of course, it is.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
It was taken by the Cassini space probe.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
But it's a famous picture, not because of

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
the beauty and majesty of Saturn's rings,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
but actually because of a tiny, faint blob

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
just hanging underneath one of the rings.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
And if I blow it up there, you see it.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
It looks like a moon,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
but in fact, it's a picture of Earth.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
It was a picture of Earth captured in that frame of Saturn.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
That's our planet from 750 million miles away.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
I think the Earth has got a strange property

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
that the farther away you get from it,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
the more beautiful it seems.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
But that is not the most distant or most famous picture of our planet.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
It was taken by this thing, which is called the Voyager spacecraft.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
And that's a picture of me in front of it for scale.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
The Voyager is a tiny machine.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
It's currently 10 billion miles away from Earth,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
transmitting with that dish, with the power of 20 watts,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
and we're still in contact with it.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
But it visited Jupiter, Saturn,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Uranus and Neptune.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
And after it visited all four of those planets,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Carl Sagan, who's one of my great heroes,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
had the wonderful idea

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
of turning Voyager around

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
and taking a picture of every planet it had visited.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
And it took this picture of Earth.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Now it's very hard to see the Earth there, it's called the "Pale Blue Dot" picture,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
but Earth is suspended in that red shaft of light.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
That's Earth from four billion miles away.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
And I'd like to read you what

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Sagan wrote about it, just to finish,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
because I cannot say words as beautiful as this

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
to describe what he saw

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
in that picture that he had taken.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
He said, "Consider again that dot.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
That's here. That's home. That's us.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
On it, everyone you love,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
everyone you know, everyone you've ever heard of,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
every human being who ever was

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
lived out their lives.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
The aggregates of joy and suffering

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
thousands of confident religions,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
ideologies and economic doctrines,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
every hunter and forager, every hero and coward,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
every creator and destroyer of civilization,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
every king and peasant, every young couple in love,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
every mother and father, hopeful child,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
inventor and explorer,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
every superstar, every supreme leader,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
every saint and sinner in the history of our species,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
lived there, on a mote of dust,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
suspended in a sunbeam.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
It's been said that astronomy's a humbling

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
and character-building experience.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
There is perhaps no better demonstration

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
of the folly of human conceits

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
than this distant image of our tiny world.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
To me, it underscores our responsibility

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
to deal more kindly with one another

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
the only home we've ever known."

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Beautiful words about

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
the power of science and exploration.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
The argument has always been made, and it will always be made,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
that we know enough about the universe.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
You could have made it in the 1920s; you wouldn't have had penicillin.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
You could have made it in the 1890s; you wouldn't have the transistor.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
And it's made today in these difficult economic times.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Surely, we know enough.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
We don't need to discover anything else about our universe.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Let me leave the last words to someone

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
who's rapidly becoming a hero of mine,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Humphrey Davy, who did his science at the turn of the 19th century.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
He was clearly under assault all the time.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
"We know enough at the turn of the 19th century.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Just exploit it; just build things."

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
He said this, he said, "Nothing is more fatal

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
to the progress of the human mind

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
than to presume that our views of science

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
are ultimate,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
that our triumphs are complete,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
that there are no mysteries in nature,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
and that there are no new worlds to conquer."
