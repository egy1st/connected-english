00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Hi there.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I'm going to be talking a little bit about

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
music, machines and life.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Or, more specifically,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
what we learned from the creation of a very large and complicated machine

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
for a music video.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Some of you may recognize this image.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This is the opening frame of the video that we created.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We'll be showing the video at the end,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but before we do, I want to talk a little bit about

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
what it is that they wanted.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Now, when we first started talking to OK Go --

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
the name of the song is "This Too Shall Pass" --

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
we were really excited because

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
they expressed interest in building a machine that they could dance with.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And we were very excited about this

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
because, of course,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
they have a history of dancing with machines.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
They're responsible for this video, "Here It Goes Again."

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
50-million-plus views on YouTube.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Four guys dancing on treadmills,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
no cuts, just a static camera.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
A fantastically viral and wonderful video.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So we were really excited about working with them.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And we sort of started talking about what it is that they wanted.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And they explained that they wanted

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
kind of a Rube Goldberg machine.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Now, for those of you who don't know,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
a Rube Goldberg machine

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
is a complicated contraption,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
an incredibly over-engineered piece of machinery

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
that accomplishes a relatively simple task.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
So we were excited by this idea,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and we started talking about

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
exactly what it would look like.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And we came up with some parameters, because,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
you know, building a Rube Goldberg machine

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
has limitations,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
but it also is pretty wide open.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And we wanted to make sure that we did something

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
that would work for a music video.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
So we came up with a list of requirements,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
the "10 commandments,"

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and they were, in order of ascending difficulty:

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
The first is "No magic."

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Everything that happened on screen had to be

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
very easily understood by a typical viewer.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
The rule of thumb was that, if my mother couldn't understand it,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
then we couldn't use it in the video.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
They wanted band integration,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
that is, the machine acting upon the band members,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
specifically not the other way around.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
They wanted the machine action to follow the song feeling.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
So as the song picks up emotion,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
so should the machine

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
get grander in its process.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
They wanted us to make use of the space.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
So we have this 10,000-square-foot warehouse we were using,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
divided between two floors.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
It included an exterior loading dock.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
We used all of that, including a giant hole in the floor

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
that we actually descended the camera and cameraman through.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
They wanted it messy, and we were happy to oblige.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
The machine itself would start the music.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
So the machine would get started,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
it would travel some distance,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
reacting along the way,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
hit play on an iPod or a tape deck

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
or something that would start playback.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And the machine would maintain synchronization throughout.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And speaking of synchronization,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
they wanted it to sync to the rhythm

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and to hit specific beats along the way.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Okay. (Laughter)

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
They wanted it to end precisely on time.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Okay, so now the start to finish timing has to be perfect.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
And they wanted the music to drop out

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
at a certain point in the video

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
and actual live audio from the machine

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
to play part of the song.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And as if that wasn't enough,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
all of these incredibly complicating things, right,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
they wanted it in one shot.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
(Laughter)

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
(Applause)

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Okay.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
So, just some statistics

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
about what we went through in the process.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
The machine itself has

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
89 distinct interactions.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
It took us 85 takes

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
to get it on film

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
to our satisfaction.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Of those 85 takes,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
only three actually successfully completed their run.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
We destroyed two pianos

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and 10 televisions in the process.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
We went to Home Depot well over a hundred times.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
(Laughter)

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And we lost one high-heeled shoe

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
when one of our engineers, Heather Knight,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
left her high-heeled shoe -- after a nice dinner,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
and returned back to the build --

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
and left it in a pile of stuff.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
And another engineer thought, "Well, that would be a really good thing to use"

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
and ended up using it as a really nice trigger.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
And it's actually in the machine.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
So what did we learn from all of this?

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Well, having completed this,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
we have the opportunity to step back and reflect

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
on some of the things.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
And we learned that small stuff stinks.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Little balls in wooden tracks

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
are really susceptible to

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
humidity and temperature and a little bit of dust,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
and they fall out of the tracks,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
the exact angles makes it hard to get right.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
And yet, a bowling ball will always follow the same path.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
It doesn't matter what temperature it is,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
doesn't matter what's in its way;

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
it will pretty much get where it needs to go.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
But as much as the small stuff stinks, we needed somewhere to start,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
so that we would have somewhere to go.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And so you have to start with it. You have to focus on it.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Small stuff stinks,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
but, of course, it's essential, right?

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
What else? Planning is incredibly important.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
(Laughter)

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
You know, we spent a lot of time ideating

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and even building some of these things.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
It's been said that, "No battle plan

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
survives contact with the enemy."

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
I think our enemy was physics --

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
(Laughter)

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
and she's a cruel mistress.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Often, we had to pull things out as a result

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
because of timing or aesthetics or whatever.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
And so while planning is important, so is flexibility.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
These are all things that ended up

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
not making it into the final machine.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
So also, put reliable stuff last,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
the stuff that's going to run every time.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Again, small to large is relevant here.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
The little Lego car in the beginning of the video

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
references the big, real car

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
near the end of the video.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
The big, real car works every time; there's no problem about it.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
The little one had a tendency to try to run off the track

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
and that's a problem.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
But you don't want to have to reset the whole machine

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
because the Lego car at the end doesn't work, right.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
So you put that up front so that, if it fails,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
at least you know

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
you don't have to reset the whole thing.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Life can be

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
messy.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
There were incredibly difficult moments in the building of this thing.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Months were spent in this tiny, cold warehouse.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
And the wonderful elation that we had

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
when we finally completed it.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
So it's important to remember that whether it's good or it's bad,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
"This Too Shall Pass."

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Thank you very much.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000
(Applause)

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
And now to introduce

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
their music video,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
we have OK Go.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
OK Go: An introduction. Hello TEDxUSC.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
We are OK Go.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
What are we doing? Oh, just hanging out with our Grammy. What what!

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
It think we can do better than this. Hello TEDxUSC.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
We are OK Go. Have you read the "Natural Curiosity Cabinet?"

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
I mean, "Curiosity" -- excuse me.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Let me start again.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
We need some more ridiculous things besides "The Cabinet of Natural Curiosities."

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Tim's sundial hat.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Have you seen the new work they've done to the Waltz Towers?

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Sorry, start again.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
(Barking)

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Dogs.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Hello, TEDxUSC. We are OK Go,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and this our new video, "This Too Shall Pass."

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
[unclear]

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Kay, we can still do one better I think, yeah.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
That one's pretty good. It's getting better.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:59.000
(Music)

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
♫ You know you can't keep letting it get you down ♫

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
♫ And you can't keep dragging that dead weight around ♫

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
♫ This too shall pass ♫

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
♫ You know you can't keep letting it get you down ♫

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
♫ No, you can't keep letting it get you down ♫

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
♫ Let it go ♫

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
♫ This too shall pass ♫

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
♫ When the morning comes ♫

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
♫ When the morning comes ♫

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
♫ When the morning comes ♫

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
♫ When the morning comes ♫

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:09.000
