00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
One thing the world needs,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
one thing this country desperately needs

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
is a better way

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
of conducting our political debates.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We need to rediscover

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
the lost art of democratic argument.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
(Applause)

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
If you think about the arguments we have,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
most of the time it's shouting matches

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
on cable television,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
ideological food fights on the floor of Congress.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I have a suggestion.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Look at all the arguments we have these days

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
over health care,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
over bonuses and bailouts on Wall Street,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
over the gap between rich and poor,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
over affirmative action and same-sex marriage.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Lying just beneath the surface

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
of those arguments,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
with passions raging on all sides,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
are big questions

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
of moral philosophy,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
big questions of justice.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
But we too rarely

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
articulate and defend

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and argue about

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
those big moral questions in our politics.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
So what I would like to do today

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
is have something of a discussion.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
First, let me take

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
a famous philosopher

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
who wrote about those questions

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
of justice and morality,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
give you a very short lecture

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
on Aristotle of ancient Athens,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Aristotle's theory of justice,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and then have a discussion here

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
to see whether Aristotle's ideas

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
actually inform

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
the way we think and argue

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
about questions today.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
So, are you ready for the lecture?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
According to Aristotle,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
justice means giving people what they deserve.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
That's it; that's the lecture.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
(Laughter)

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Now, you may say, well, that's obvious enough.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
The real questions begin

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
when it comes to arguing about

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
who deserves what and why.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Take the example of flutes.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Suppose we're distributing flutes.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Who should get the best ones?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Let's see what people --

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
What would you say?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Who should get the best flute?

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
You can just call it out.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
(Audience: Random.)

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Michael Sandel: At random. You would do it by lottery.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Or by the first person to rush into the hall to get them.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Who else?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
(Audience: The best flute players.)

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
MS: The best flute players. (Audience: The worst flute players.)

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
MS: The worst flute players.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
How many say the best flute players?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Why?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Actually, that was Aristotle's answer too.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
(Laughter)

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
But here's a harder question.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Why do you think,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
those of you who voted this way,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
that the best flutes should go to the best flute players?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Peter: The greatest benefit to all.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
MS: The greatest benefit to all.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
We'll hear better music

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
if the best flutes should go to the best flute players.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
That's Peter? (Audience: Peter.)

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
MS: All right.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Well, it's a good reason.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
We'll all be better off if good music is played

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
rather than terrible music.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
But Peter,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Aristotle doesn't agree with you that that's the reason.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
That's all right.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Aristotle had a different reason

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
for saying the best flutes should go to the best flute players.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
He said,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
that's what flutes are for --

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
to be played well.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
He says that to reason about

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
just distribution of a thing,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
we have to reason about,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and sometimes argue about,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
the purpose of the thing,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
or the social activity --

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
in this case, musical performance.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And the point, the essential nature,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
of musical performance

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
is to produce excellent music.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
It'll be a happy byproduct

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
that we'll all benefit.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
But when we think about justice,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Aristotle says,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
what we really need to think about

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
is the essential nature of the activity in question

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
and the qualities that are worth

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
honoring and admiring and recognizing.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
One of the reasons

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
that the best flute players should get the best flutes

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
is that musical performance

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
is not only to make the rest of us happy,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
but to honor

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
and recognize

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
the excellence

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
of the best musicians.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Now, flutes may seem ... the distribution of flutes

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
may seem a trivial case.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Let's take a contemporary example

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
of the dispute about justice.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
It had to do with golf.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Casey Martin -- a few years ago,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Casey Martin --

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
did any of you hear about him?

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
He was a very good golfer,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
but he had a disability.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
He had a bad leg, a circulatory problem,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
that made it very painful

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
for him to walk the course.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
In fact, it carried risk of injury.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
He asked the PGA,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
the Professional Golfers' Association,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
for permission to use a golf cart

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
in the PGA tournaments.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
They said, "No.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Now that would give you an unfair advantage."

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
He sued,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
and his case went all the way

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
to the Supreme Court, believe it or not,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
the case over the golf cart,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
because the law says

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
that the disabled

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
must be accommodated,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
provided the accommodation does not

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
change the essential nature

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
of the activity.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
He says, "I'm a great golfer.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
I want to compete.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
But I need a golf cart

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
to get from one hole to the next."

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Suppose you were

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
on the Supreme Court.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Suppose you were deciding

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
the justice of this case.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
How many here would say

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
that Casey Martin does have a right to use a golf cart?

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
And how many say, no, he doesn't?

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
All right, let's take a poll, show of hands.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
How many would rule in favor of Casey Martin?

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
And how many would not? How many would say he doesn't?

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
All right, we have a good division of opinion here.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Someone who would not

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
grant Casey Martin the right to a golf cart,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
what would be your reason?

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Raise your hand, and we'll try to get you a microphone.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
What would be your reason?

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
(Audience: It'd be an unfair advantage.)

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
MS: It would be an unfair advantage

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
if he gets to ride in a golf cart.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
All right, those of you,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
I imagine most of you who would not give him the golf cart

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
worry about an unfair advantage.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
What about those of you who say

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
he should be given a golf cart?

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
How would you answer the objection?

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Yes, all right.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Audience: The cart's not part of the game.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
MS: What's your name? (Audience: Charlie.)

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
MS: Charlie says --

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
We'll get Charlie a microphone in case someone wants to reply.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Tell us, Charlie,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
why would you say he should be able to use a golf cart?

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Charlie: The cart's not part of the game.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
MS: But what about walking from hole to hole?

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Charlie: It doesn't matter; it's not part of the game.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
MS: Walking the course is not part of the game of golf?

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Charlie: Not in my book, it isn't.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
MS: All right. Stay there, Charlie.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
(Laughter)

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Who has an answer for Charlie?

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
All right, who has an answer for Charlie?

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
What would you say?

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Audience: The endurance element is a very important part of the game,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
walking all those holes.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
MS: Walking all those holes?

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
That's part of the game of golf? (Audience: Absolutely.)

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
MS: What's your name? (Audience: Warren.)

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
MS: Warren.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Charlie, what do you say to Warren?

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Charley: I'll stick to my original thesis.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.000
(Laughter)

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
MS: Warren, are you a golfer?

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Warren: I am not a golfer.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Charley: And I am. (MS: Okay.)

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
(Laughter)

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
(Applause)

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
You know,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
it's interesting.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
In the case, in the lower court,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
they brought in golfing greats

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
to testify on this very issue.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Is walking the course essential to the game?

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
And they brought in Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
And what do you suppose they all said?

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Yes. They agreed with Warren.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
They said, yes, walking the course

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
is strenuous physical exercise.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
The fatigue factor is an important part of golf.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
And so it would change

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
the fundamental nature of the game

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
to give him the golf cart.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Now, notice,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
something interesting --

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Well, I should tell you about the Supreme Court first.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
The Supreme Court

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
decided.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
What do you suppose they said?

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
They said yes,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
that Casey Martin must be provided a golf cart.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Seven to two, they ruled.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
What was interesting about their ruling

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
and about the discussion we've just had

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
is that the discussion about

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
the right, the justice, of the matter

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
depended on

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
figuring out what is

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
the essential nature of golf.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
And the Supreme Court justices

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
wrestled with that question.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
And Justice Stevens, writing for the majority,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
said he had read all about the history of golf,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
and the essential point of the game

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
is to get very small ball from one place

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
into a hole

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
in as few strokes as possible,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
and that walking was not essential, but incidental.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Now, there were two dissenters,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
one of whom was Justice Scalia.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
He wouldn't have granted the cart,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
and he had a very interesting dissent.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
It's interesting because

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
he rejected the Aristotelian premise

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
underlying the majority's opinion.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
He said it's not possible

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
to determine the essential nature

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
of a game like golf.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Here's how he put it.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
"To say that something is essential

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
is ordinarily to say that it is necessary

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
to the achievement of a certain object.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
But since it is the very nature of a game

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
to have no object except amusement,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
(Laughter)

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
that is, what distinguishes games

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
from productive activity,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
(Laughter)

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
it is quite impossible to say

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
that any of a game's arbitrary rules

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
is essential."

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
So there you have Justice Scalia

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
taking on the Aristotelian premise

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
of the majority's opinion.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Justice Scalia's opinion

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
is questionable

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
for two reasons.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
First, no real sports fan would talk that way.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
(Laughter)

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
If we had thought that the rules

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
of the sports we care about

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
are merely arbitrary,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
rather than designed to call forth

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
the virtues and the excellences

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
that we think are worthy of admiring,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
we wouldn't care about the outcome of the game.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
It's also objectionable

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
on a second ground.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
On the face of it,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
it seemed to be -- this debate about the golf cart --

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
an argument about fairness,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
what's an unfair advantage.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
But if fairness were the only thing at stake,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
there would have been an easy and obvious solution.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
What would it be? (Audience: Let everyone use the cart.)

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Let everyone ride in a golf cart

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
if they want to.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Then the fairness objection goes away.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
But letting everyone ride in a cart

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
would have been, I suspect,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
more anathema

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
to the golfing greats

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
and to the PGA,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
even than making an exception for Casey Martin.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Why?

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Because what was at stake

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
in the dispute over the golf cart

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
was not only the essential nature of golf,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
but, relatedly, the question:

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
What abilities

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
are worthy

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
of honor and recognition

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
as athletic talents?

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Let me put the point

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
as delicately as possible:

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Golfers are a little sensitive

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
about the athletic status of their game.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000
(Laughter)

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
After all, there's no running or jumping,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
and the ball stands still.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
(Laughter)

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
So if golfing is the kind of game

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
that can be played while riding around in a golf cart,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
it would be hard to confer

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
on the golfing greats

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
the status that we confer,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
the honor and recognition

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
that goes to truly great athletes.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
That illustrates

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
that with golf,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
as with flutes,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
it's hard to decide the question

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
of what justice requires,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
without grappling with the question,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
"What is the essential nature

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
of the activity in question,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
and what qualities,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
what excellences

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
connected with that activity,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
are worthy of honor and recognition?"

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Let's take a final example

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
that's prominent in contemporary political debate:

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
same-sex marriage.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
There are those who favor state recognition

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
only of traditional marriage

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
between one man and one woman,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
and there are those who favor state recognition

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
of same-sex marriage.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
How many here

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
favor the first policy:

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
the state should recognize traditional marriage only?

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
And how many favor the second, same-sex marriage?

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Now, put it this way:

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
What ways of thinking

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
about justice and morality

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
underlie the arguments we have

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
over marriage?

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
The opponents of same-sex marriage say

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
that the purpose of marriage,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
fundamentally, is procreation,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
and that's what's worthy of honoring

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
and recognizing and encouraging.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
And the defenders of same-sex marriage say no,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
procreation is not the only purpose of marriage;

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
what about a lifelong, mutual, loving commitment?

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
That's really what marriage is about.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
So with flutes, with golf carts,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
and even with a fiercely contested question

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
like same-sex marriage,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Aristotle has a point.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Very hard to argue about justice

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
without first arguing

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
about the purpose of social institutions

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
and about what qualities are worthy

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
of honor and recognition.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
So let's step back from these cases

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
and see how they shed light

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
on the way we might improve, elevate,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
the terms of political discourse

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
in the United States,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
and for that matter, around the world.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
There is a tendency to think

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
that if we engage too directly

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
with moral questions in politics,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
that's a recipe for disagreement,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
and for that matter, a recipe for

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
intolerance and coercion.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
So better to shy away from,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
to ignore,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
the moral and the religious convictions

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
that people bring to civic life.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
It seems to me that our discussion

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
reflects the opposite,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
that a better way

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
to mutual respect

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
is to engage directly

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
with the moral convictions

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
citizens bring to public life,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
rather than to require

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
that people leave their deepest moral convictions

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
outside politics

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
before they enter.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
That, it seems to me, is a way

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
to begin to restore

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
the art of democratic argument.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Thank you very much.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
(Applause)

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Thank you.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
(Applause)

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Thank you.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
(Applause)

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Thank you very much.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
Thanks. Thank you.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Chris.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Thanks, Chris.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Chris Anderson: From flutes to golf courses

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
to same-sex marriage --

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
that was a genius link.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Now look, you're a pioneer of open education.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Your lecture series was one of the first to do it big.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
What's your vision for the next phase of this?

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
MS: Well, I think that it is possible.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
In the classroom, we have arguments

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
on some of the most fiercely held

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
moral convictions that students have

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
about big public questions.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
And I think we can do that in public life more generally.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
And so my real dream would be

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
to take the public television series

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
that we've created of the course --

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
it's available now, online,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
free for everyone anywhere in the world --

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
and to see whether we can partner with institutions,

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
at universities in China, in India,

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
in Africa, around the world,

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
to try to promote

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
civic education

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
and also a richer kind

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
of democratic debate.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
CA: So you picture, at some point,

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
live, in real time,

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
you could have this kind of conversation, inviting questions,

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
but with people from China and India joining in?

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
MS: Right. We did a little bit of it here

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
with 1,500 people in Long Beach,

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
and we do it in a classroom at Harvard

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
with about 1,000 students.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
Wouldn't it be interesting

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
to take this way

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
of thinking and arguing,

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
engaging seriously with big moral questions,

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
exploring cultural differences

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
and connect through a live video hookup,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
students in Beijing and Mumbai

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
and in Cambridge, Massachusetts

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
and create a global classroom.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
That's what I would love to do.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000
(Applause)

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
CA: So, I would imagine

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000
that there are a lot of people who would love to join you in that endeavor.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
Michael Sandel. Thank you so much. (MS: Thanks so much.)
