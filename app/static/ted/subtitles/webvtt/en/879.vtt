00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In Africa we say,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
"God gave the white man a watch

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and gave the black man time."

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
(Laughter)

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I think, how is it possible

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
for a man with so much time

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
to tell his story in 18 minutes?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I think it will be quite a challenge for me.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Most African stories these days,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
they talk about famine,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
HIV and AIDS,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
poverty or war.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
But my story that I would like to share with you today

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
is the one about success.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It is about a country

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
in the southwest of Africa

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
called Namibia.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Namibia has got 2.1 million people,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
but it is only twice the size of California.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I come from a region

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
in the remote northwest part of the country.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
It's called Kunene region.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And in the center of Kunene region

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
is the village of Sesfontein. This is where I was born.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
This is where I'm coming from.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Most people that are following the story

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
of Angelina Jolie

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and Brad Pitt

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
will know where Namibia is.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
They love Namibia

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
for its beautiful dunes,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
that are even taller

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
than the Empire State Building.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Wind and time have twisted our landscape

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
into very strange shapes,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and these shapes are speckled with wildlife

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
that has become so adapted

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
to this harsh and strange land.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I'm a Himba.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
You might wonder, why are you wearing these Western clothes?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I'm a Himba and Namibian.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
A Himba is one of the 29

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
ethnic groups in Namibia.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
We live a very traditional lifestyle.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I grew up herding,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
looking after our livestock --

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
goats, sheep and cattle.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And one day,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
my father actually took me into the bush.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
He said, "John,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
I want you to become a good herder.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Boy, if you are looking after our livestock

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and you see a cheetah

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
eating our goat --

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
cheetah is very nervous --

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
just walk up to it.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Walk up to it and smack it on the backside."

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
(Laughter)

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
"And he will let go of the goat

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and run off."

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
But then he said,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
"Boy, if you run into a lion,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
don't move.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Don't move. Stand your ground.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Puff up and just look it in the eye

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and it may not want to fight you."

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
(Laughter)

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
But then, he said,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
"If you see a leopard,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
boy, you better run like hell."

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
(Laughter)

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
"Imagine you run faster than those goats you are looking after."

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
In this way --

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
(Laughter)

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
In this way, I actually started to learn about nature.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
In addition to being an ordinary Namibian

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
and in addition to being a Himba

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
I'm also a trained conservationist.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And it is very important if you are in the field

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
to know what to confront

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
and what to run from.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
I was born in 1971.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
We lived under apartheid regime.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
The whites could farm, graze

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and hunt as they wished,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
but we black, we were not regarded as responsible

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
to use wildlife.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Whenever we tried to hunt,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
we were called poachers.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
And as a result, we were fined and locked up in jail.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Between 1966 and 1990,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
the U.S. and Soviet interests

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
fought for control over my country.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And you know, during war time,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
there are militaries, armies, that are moving around.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And the army hunted for valuable rhino horns

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
and tusks.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
They could sell these things for anything between

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
$5,000 a kilo.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
During the same year

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
almost every Himba had a rifle.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Because it was wartime,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
the British .303 rifle

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
was just all over the whole country.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Then in the same time, around 1980,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
we had a very big drought.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
It killed almost everything that was left.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Our livestock was

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
almost at the brink of extinction,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
protected as well.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
We were hungry.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
I remember a night

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
when a hungry leopard

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
went into the house

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
of one of our neighbors

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
and took a sleeping child out of the bed.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
It's a very sad story.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
But even today,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
that memory is still in people's minds.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
They can pinpoint the exact location

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
where this all happened.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
And then, in the same year,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
we almost lost everything.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And my father said, "Why don't you just go to school?"

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
And they sent me off to school, just to get busy somewhere there.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And the year I went to school,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
my father actually got a job with a non-governmental organization

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
called IRDNC, Integrated Rural Development and Nature Conservation.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
They actually spend a lot of time a year in the communities.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
They were trusted by the local communities

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
like our leader, Joshua Kangombe.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Joshua Kangombe saw what was happening:

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
wildlife disappearing,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
poaching was skyrocketing,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
and the situation seemed very hopeless.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Death and despair surrounded Joshua

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
and our entire communities.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
But then, the people from IRDNC proposed to Joshua:

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
What if we pay people that you trust

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
to look after wildlife?

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Do you have anybody in your communities, or people,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
that know the bush very well

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
and that know wildlife very well?

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
The headman said: "Yes. Our poachers."

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
"Eh? The poachers?"

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
"Yes. Our poachers."

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And that was my father.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
My father has been a poacher for quite a long time.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Instead of shooting poachers dead

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
like they were doing elsewhere in Africa,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
IRDNC has helped men reclaim their abilities

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
to manage their peoples

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
and their rights to own and manage wildlife.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
And thus, as people started feeling ownership over wildlife,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
wildlife numbers started coming back,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
and that's actually becoming a foundation for conservation in Namibia.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
With independence, the whole approach of community getting involved

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
was embraced by our new government.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Three things that actually help to build on this foundation:

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
The very first one is

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
honoring of tradition and being open to new ideas.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Here is our tradition:

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
At every Himba village, there is a sacred fire.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
And at this sacred fire, the spirit of our ancestors

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
speak through the headman

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
and advise us where to get water,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
where to get grazings,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
and where to go and hunt.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And I think this is the best way of regulating ourselves

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
on the environment.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
And here are the new ideas.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Transporting rhinos using helicopters

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
I think is much easier

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
than talking through a spirit that you can't see, isn't it?

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
And these things we were taught by outsiders.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
We learned these things from outsiders.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
We needed new boundaries to describe our traditional lands;

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
we needed to learn more things like GPS

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
just to see whether --

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
can GPS really reflect the true reflection of the land

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
or is this just a thing made somewhere in the West?

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
And we then wanted to see whether we can match our

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
ancestral maps with digital maps made somewhere in the world.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
And through this,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
we actually started realizing our dreams,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
and we maintained honoring our traditions

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
but we were still open to new ideas.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
The second element is that we wanted to have a life,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
a better life where we can benefit through many things.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Most poachers, like my father,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
were people from our own community.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
They were not people from outside.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
These were our own people.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
And sometimes, once they were caught,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
they were treated with respect, brought back into the communities

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
and they were made part of the bigger dreams.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
The best one, like my father -- I'm not campaigning for my father --

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
(Laughter)

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
they were put in charge to stop others from poaching.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
And when this thing started going on,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
we started becoming one community,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
renewing our connection to nature.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
And that was a very strong thing in Namibia.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
The last element that actually helped develop these things

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
was the partnerships.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Our government has given legal status over our traditional lands.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
The other partners that we have got

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
is business communities.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Business communities helped bring Namibia onto the world map

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
and they have also helped make wildlife

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
a very valuable land use like any other land uses

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
such as agriculture.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
And most of my conservation colleagues today

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
that you find in Namibia

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
have been trained through the initiative,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
through the involvement of World Wildlife Fund

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
in the most up-to-date conservation practices.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
They have also given funding for two decades

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
to this whole program.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
And so far, with the support of World Wildlife Fund,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
we've been able to scale up the very small programs

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
to national programs today.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Namibia ... or Sesfontein

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
was no more an isolated village somewhere,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
hidden away in Namibia.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
With these assets we are now part of the global village.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Thirty years have passed

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000
since my father's first job as a community game guard.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
It's very unfortunate that he passed away and he cannot see the success

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
as I and my children see it today.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
When I finished school in 1995,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:01.000
there were only 20 lions in the entire Northwest -- in our area.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:07.000
But today, there are more than 130 lions.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:13.000
(Applause)

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
So please, if you go to Namibia,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
make sure that you stay in the tents.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Don't walk out at night!

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000
(Laughter)

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
The black rhino -- they were almost extinct in 1982.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000
But today, Kunene has the largest concentration of black rhino --

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
free-roaming black rhinos -- in the world.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
This is outside the protected area.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
(Applause)

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
The leopard -- they are now in big numbers

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
but they are now far away from our village,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
because the natural plain has multiplied,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
like zebras, springboks and everything.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
They stay very much far away

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
because this other thing has multiplied

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
from less than a thousand to tens of thousands of animals.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
What started as very small,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
community rangers getting community involved,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
has now grown into something that we call conservancies.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Conservancies are legally instituted institutions

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
by the government,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
and these are run by the communities themselves, for their benefit.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Today, we have got 60 conservancies

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
that manage and protect over 13 million hectares

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
of land in Namibia.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000
We have already reshaped conservation in the entire country.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Nowhere else in the world

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
has community-adopted conservation at this scale.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000
(Applause)

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
In 2008, conservancy generated 5.7 million dollars.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
This is our new economy --

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
an economy based on the respect of our natural resources.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
And we are able to use this money for many things:

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Very importantly, we put it in education.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Secondly, we put it for infrastructure. Food.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Very important as well -- we invest this money in AIDS and HIV education.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
You know that Africa is being affected by these viruses.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
And this is the good news from Africa

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
that we have to shout from the rooftops.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:30.000
(Applause)

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
And now, what the world really needs

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:41.000
is for you to help me and our partners

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
take some of what we have learned in Namibia

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000
to other places with similar problems:

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000
places like Mongolia,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000
or even in your own backyards,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
the Northern Great Plains,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
where buffalo and other animals have suffered

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
and many communities are in decline.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
I like that one:

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Namibia serving as a model to Africa,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
and Africa serving as a model to the United States.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:26.000
(Applause)

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
We were successful in Namibia

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
because we dreamed of a future

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000
that was much more than just a healthy wildlife.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000
We knew conservation would fail

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:47.000
if it doesn't work to improve the lives of the local communities.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
So, come and talk to me about Namibia,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
and better yet, come to Namibia

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
and see for yourself how we have done it.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
And please, do visit our website

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
to learn more and see how you can help CBNRM

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
in Africa and across the world.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Thank you very much.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:24.000
(Applause)
