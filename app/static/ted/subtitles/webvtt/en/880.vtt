00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Those of you who may remember me from TEDGlobal

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
remember me asking a few questions

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
which still preoccupy me.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
One of them was: Why is it necessary to spend

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
six billion pounds

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
speeding up the Eurostar train

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
when, for about 10 percent of that money,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
you could have top supermodels, male and female,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
serving free Chateau Petrus to all the passengers

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
for the entire duration of the journey?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
You'd still have five billion left in change,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and people would ask for the trains to be slowed down.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Now, you may remember me asking the question as well,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
a very interesting observation,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
that actually those strange little signs

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
that actually flash "35" at you,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
occasionally accompanying a little smiley face

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
or a frown,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
according to whether you're within or outside the speed limit --

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
those are actually more effective

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
at preventing road accidents than speed cameras,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
which come with the actual threat

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
of real punishment.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So there seems to be a strange disproportionality at work,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I think, in many areas of human problem solving,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
particularly those which involve human psychology,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
which is: The tendency

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
of the organization or the institution

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
is to deploy as much force as possible,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
as much compulsion as possible,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
whereas actually, the tendency of the person

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
is to be almost influenced

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
in absolute reverse proportion

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
to the amount of force being applied.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So there seems to be a complete disconnect here.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So what I'm asking for is the creation of a new job title --

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I'll come to this a little later --

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and perhaps the addition of a new word

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
into the English language.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Because it does seem to me that large organizations

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
including government, which is, of course, the largest organization of all,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
have actually become

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
completely disconnected

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
with what actually matters to people.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Let me give you one example of this.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
You may remember this as the AOL-Time Warner merger, okay,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
heralded at the time as the largest

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
single deal of all time.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
It may still be, for all I know.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Now, all of you in this room, in one form or other,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
are probably customers of one or both

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
of those organizations that merged.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Just interested, did anybody notice anything different

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
as a result of this at all?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
So unless you happened to be a shareholder

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
of one or the other organizations

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
or one of the dealmakers or lawyers involved in the no-doubt lucrative activity,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
you're actually engaging in a huge piece of activity

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
that meant absolutely bugger-all to anybody, okay?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
By contrast, years of marketing have taught me

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
that if you actually want people to remember you

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and to appreciate what you do,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
the most potent things are actually very, very small.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
This is from Virgin Atlantic upper-class,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
it's the cruet salt and pepper set.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Quite nice in itself, they're little, sort of, airplane things.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
What's really, really sweet is every single person looking at these things

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
has exactly the same mischievous thought,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
which is, "I reckon I can heist these."

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
However, you pick them up and underneath,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
actually engraved in the metal, are the words,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
"Stolen from Virgin Atlantic Airways upper-class."

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
(Laughter)

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Now, years after

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
you remember the strategic question

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
of whether you're flying in a 777 or an Airbus,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
you remember those words and that experience.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Similarly, this is from a hotel in Stockholm, the Lydmar.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Has anybody stayed there?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
It's the lift, it's a series of buttons in the lift.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Nothing unusual about that at all,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
except that these are actually not the buttons that take you to an individual floor.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
It starts with garage at the bottom, I suppose, appropriately,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
but it doesn't go up garage, grand floor, mezzanine, one, two, three, four.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
It actually says garage, funk, rhythm and blues.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
You have a series of buttons. You actually choose your lift music.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
My guess is that the cost of installing this in the lift

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
in the Lydmar Hotel in Stockholm

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
is probably 500 to 1,000 pounds max.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
It's frankly more memorable

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
than all those millions of hotels we've all stayed at

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
that tell you that your room has actually been recently renovated

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
at a cost of 500,000 dollars,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
in order to make it resemble every other hotel room you've ever stayed in

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
in the entire course of your life.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Now, these are trivial marketing examples, I accept.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
But I was at a TED event recently and Esther Duflo,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
probably one of the leading experts in,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
effectively, the eradication of poverty in the developing world,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
actually spoke.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
And she came across a similar example

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
of something that fascinated me

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
as being something which, in a business context or a government context,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
would simply be so trivial a solution

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
as to seem embarrassing.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
It was simply to encourage the inoculation of children

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
by, not only making it a social event --

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
I think good use of behavioral economics in that,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
if you turn up with several other mothers

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
to have your child inoculated,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
your sense of confidence is much greater than if you turn up alone.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
But secondly, to incentivize that inoculation

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
by giving a kilo of lentils to everybody who participated.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
It's a tiny, tiny thing.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
If you're a senior person at UNESCO

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
and someone says, "So what are you doing

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
to eradicate world poverty?"

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
you're not really confident standing up there

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
saying, "I've got it cracked; it's the lentils," are you?

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Our own sense of self-aggrandizement

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
feels that big important problems

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
need to have big important, and most of all, expensive

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
solutions attached to them.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And yet, what behavioral economics shows time after time after time

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
is in human behavioral and behavioral change

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
there's a very, very strong disproportionality at work,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
that actually what changes our behavior

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
and what changes our attitude to things

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
is not actually proportionate to the degree

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
of expense entailed,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
or the degree of force that's applied.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
But everything about institutions

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
makes them uncomfortable

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
with that disproportionality.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
So what happens in an institution

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
is the very person who has the power to solve the problem

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
also has a very, very large budget.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
And once you have a very, very large budget,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
you actually look for expensive things to spend it on.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
What is completely lacking is a class of people

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
who have immense amounts of power, but no money at all.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
(Laughter)

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
It's those people I'd quite like to create

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
in the world going forward.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Now, here's another thing that happens,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
which is what I call sometimes "Terminal 5 syndrome,"

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
which is that big, expensive things

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
get big, highly-intelligent attention,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
and they're great, and Terminal 5 is absolutely magnificent,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
until you get down to the small detail, the usability,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
which is the signage,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
which is catastrophic.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
You come out of "Arrive" at the airport, and you follow

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
a big yellow sign that says "Trains" and it's in front of you.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
So you walk for another hundred yards,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
expecting perhaps another sign,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
that might courteously be yellow, in front of you and saying "Trains."

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
No, no, no, the next one is actually blue, to your left,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
and says "Heathrow Express."

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
I mean, it could almost be rather like that scene from the film "Airplane."

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
A yellow sign? That's exactly what they'll be expecting.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Actually, what happens in the world increasingly --

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
now, all credit to the British Airport Authority.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
I spoke about this before,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and a brilliant person got in touch with me and said, "Okay, what can you do?"

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
So I did come up with five suggestions, which they are actually actioning.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
One of them also being,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
although logically it's quite a good idea

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
to have a lift with no up and down button in it,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
if it only serves two floors,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
it's actually bloody terrifying, okay?

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Because when the door closes

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
and there's nothing for you to do,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
you've actually just stepped into a Hammer film.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
(Laughter)

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
So these questions ... what is happening in the world

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
is the big stuff, actually,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
is done magnificently well.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
But the small stuff, what you might call the user interface,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
is done spectacularly badly.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
But also, there seems to be a complete sort of gridlock

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
in terms of solving these small solutions.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Because the people who can actually solve them

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
actually are too powerful and too preoccupied

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
with something they think of as "strategy" to actually solve them.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
I tried this exercise recently, talking about banking.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
They said, "Can we do an advertising campaign?

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
What can we do and encourage more online banking?"

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
I said, "It's really, really easy."

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
I said, "When people login to their online bank

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
there are lots and lots of things they'd probably quite like to look at.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
The last thing in the world you ever want to see is your balance."

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
I've got friends who actually

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
never use their own bank cash machines

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
because there's the risk that it might display

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
their balance on the screen.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Why would you willingly expose yourself to bad news?

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Okay, you simply wouldn't.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
I said, "If you make, actually, 'Tell me my balance.'

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
If you make that an option rather than the default,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
you'll find twice as many people log on to online banking,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
and they do it three times as often."

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Let's face it, most of us -- how many of you

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
actually check your balance before you remove cash from a cash machine?

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
And you're pretty rich by the standards of the world at large.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Now, interesting that no single person does that,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
or at least can admit to being so anal as to do it.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
But what's interesting about that suggestion

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
was that, to implement that suggestion wouldn't cost 10 million pounds;

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
it wouldn't involve large amounts of expenditure;

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
it would actually cost about 50 quid.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
And yet, it never happens.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Because there's a fundamental disconnect, as I said,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
that actually, the people with the power

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
want to do big expensive things.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
And there's to some extent a big strategy myth

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
that's prevalent in business now.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
And if you think about it, it's very, very important

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
that the strategy myth is maintained.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Because, if the board of directors convince everybody

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
that the success of any organization

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
is almost entirely dependent on the decisions made by the board of directors,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
it makes the disparity in salaries

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
slightly more justifiable

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
than if you actually acknowledge that quite a lot of the credit for a company's success

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
might actually lie somewhere else,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
in small pieces of tactical activity.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
But what is happening is that effectively --

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
and the invention of the spreadsheet hasn't helped this;

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
lots of things haven't helped this --

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
business and government suffers from a kind of physics envy.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
It wants the world to be the kind of place where

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
the input and the change are proportionate.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
It's a kind of mechanistic world

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
that we'd all love to live in

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
where, effectively, it sits very nicely on spreadsheets,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
everything is numerically expressible,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
and the amount you spend on something is proportionate

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
to the scale of your success.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
That's the world people actually want.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
In truth, we do live in a world that science can understand.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Unfortunately, the science is probably closer to being climatology

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
in that in many cases,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
very, very small changes

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
can have disproportionately huge effects,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
and equally, vast areas of activity, enormous mergers,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
can actually accomplish absolutely bugger-all.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
But it's very, very uncomfortable for us

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
to actually acknowledge that we're living in such a world.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
But what I'm saying is we could just make things

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
a little bit better for ourselves

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
if we looked at it in this very simple four-way approach.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
That is actually strategy, and I'm not denying that strategy has a role.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
You know, there are cases where you spend quite a lot of money

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
and you accomplish quite a lot.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
And I'd be wrong to dis that completely.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Moving over, we come, of course, to consultancy.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
(Laughter)

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
I thought it was very indecent of Accenture

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
to ditch Tiger Woods in such

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
a sort of hurried and hasty way.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
I mean, Tiger surely was actually obeying the Accenture model.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
He developed an interesting outsourcing model for sexual services,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
(Laughter)

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
no longer tied to a single monopoly provider,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
in many cases, sourcing things locally,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
and of course, the ability to have between one and three girls delivered at any time

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
led for better load-balancing.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
So what Accenture suddenly found so unattractive about that, I'm not sure.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Then there are other things that don't cost much and achieve absolutely nothing.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
That's called trivia.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
But there's a fourth thing.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
And the fundamental problem is we don't actually have a word for this stuff.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
We don't know what to call it.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
And actually we don't spend nearly enough money

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
looking for those things,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
looking for those tiny things that may or may not work,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
but which, if they do work,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
can have a success absolutely out of proportion

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
to their expense, their efforts

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
and the disruption they cause.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
So the first thing I'd like

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
is a competition -- to anybody watching this as a film --

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
is to come up with a name for that stuff on the bottom right.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
And the second thing, I think,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
is that the world needs to have people in charge of that.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
That's why I call for the "Chief Detail Officer."

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Every corporation should have one,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
and every government should have a Ministry of Detail.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
The people who actually have no money,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
who have no extravagant budget,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
but who realize that actually

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
you might achieve greater success in uptake

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
of a government program

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
by actually doubling the level of benefits you pay,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
but you'll probably achieve exactly that same effect

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
simply by redesigning the form

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
and writing it in comprehensible English.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
And if actually we created a Ministry of Detail

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
and business actually had Chief Detail Officers,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
then that fourth quadrant,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
which is so woefully neglected at the moment,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
might finally get the attention it deserves.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Thank you very much.
