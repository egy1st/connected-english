WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Chris Anderson: We're having a debate.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The debate is over the proposition:

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
"What the world needs now

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
is nuclear energy." True or false?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And before we have the debate,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I'd like to actually take a show of hands --

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
on balance, right now, are you for or against this?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So those who are "yes," raise your hand. "For."

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Okay, hands down.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Those who are against, raise your hands.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Okay, I'm reading that at about

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
75 to 25 in favor at the start.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Which means we're going to take a vote at the end

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and see how that shifts, if at all.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
So here's the format: They're going to have six minutes each,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and then after one little, quick exchange between them,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I want two people on each side of this debate in the audience

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
to have 30 seconds

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
to make one short, crisp, pungent, powerful point.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So, in favor of the proposition, possibly shockingly,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
is one of, truly, the founders of the

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
environmental movement,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
a long-standing TEDster, the founder of the Whole Earth Catalog,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
someone we all know and love, Stewart Brand.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Stewart Brand: Whoa.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
(Applause)

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
The saying is that with climate, those who know the most

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
are the most worried.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
With nuclear, those who know the most

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
are the least worried.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
A classic example is James Hansen,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
a NASA climatologist

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
pushing for 350 parts per million

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
He came out with a wonderful book recently

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
called "Storms of My Grandchildren."

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And Hansen is hard over for nuclear power,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
as are most climatologists

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
who are engaging this issue seriously.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
This is the design situation:

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
a planet that is facing climate change

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and is now half urban.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Look at the client base for this.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Five out of six of us

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
live in the developing world.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
We are moving to cities. We are moving up in the world.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And we are educating our kids,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
having fewer kids,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
basically good news all around.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
But we move to cities, toward the bright lights,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and one of the things that is there that we want, besides jobs,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
is electricity.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And if it isn't easily gotten, we'll go ahead and steal it.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
This is one of the most desired things

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
by poor people all over the world,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
in the cities and in the countryside.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Electricity for cities, at its best,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
is what's called baseload electricity.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
That's where it is on

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
all the time.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
And so far there are only three major sources of that --

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
coal and gas, hydro-electric,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
which in most places is maxed-out --

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and nuclear.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I would love to have something in the fourth place here,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
but in terms of constant, clean,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
scalable energy,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
[solar] and wind and the other renewables

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
aren't there yet because they're inconstant.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Nuclear is and has been for 40 years.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Now, from an environmental standpoint,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
the main thing you want to look at

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
is what happens to the waste from nuclear and from coal,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
the two major sources of electricity.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
If all of your electricity in your lifetime came from nuclear,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
the waste from that lifetime of electricity

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
would go in a Coke can --

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
a pretty heavy Coke can, about two pounds.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
But one day of coal

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
adds up to one hell of a lot

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
of carbon dioxide

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
in a normal one-gigawatt coal-fired plant.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Then what happens to the waste?

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
The nuclear waste typically goes into

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
a dry cask storage

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
out back of the parking lot at the reactor site

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
because most places don't have underground storage yet.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
It's just as well, because it can stay where it is.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
While the carbon dioxide,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
vast quantities of it, gigatons,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
goes into the atmosphere

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
where we can't get it back -- yet --

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and where it is causing the problems that we're most concerned about.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
So when you add up the greenhouse gases

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
in the lifetime of these various energy sources,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
nuclear is down there with wind and hydro,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
below solar and way below, obviously, all the fossil fuels.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Wind is wonderful; I love wind.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
I love being around these

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
big wind generators.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
But one of the things we're discovering is that

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
wind, like solar, is an actually relatively

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
dilute source of energy.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And so it takes a very large footprint on the land,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
a very large footprint in terms of materials,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
five to 10 times what you'd use for nuclear,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
and typically to get one gigawatt of electricity

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
is on the order of 250 square miles

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
of wind farm.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
In places like Denmark and Germany,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
they've maxed out on wind already.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
They've run out of good sites.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
The power lines are getting overloaded.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
And you peak out.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Likewise, with solar,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
especially here in California,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
we're discovering that the 80 solar farm

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
schemes that are going forward

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
want to basically bulldoze

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
1,000 square miles of southern California desert.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Well, as an environmentalist, we would rather that didn't happen.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
It's okay on frapped-out agricultural land.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Solar's wonderful on rooftops.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
But out in the landscape,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
one gigawatt is on the order of 50 square miles

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
of bulldozed desert.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
When you add all these things up --

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Saul Griffith did the numbers and figured out

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
what would it take

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
to get 13 clean

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
terawatts of energy

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
from wind, solar and biofuels,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
and that area would be roughly the size of the United States,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
an area he refers to as "Renewistan."

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
A guy who's added it up all this very well is David Mackay,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
a physicist in England,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
and in his wonderful book, "Sustainable Energy," among other things,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
he says, "I'm not trying to be pro-nuclear. I'm just pro-arithmetic."

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
(Laughter)

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
In terms of weapons,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
the best disarmament tool so far is nuclear energy.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
We have been taking down

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
the Russian warheads,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
turning it into electricity.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Ten percent of American electricity

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
comes from decommissioned warheads.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
We haven't even started the American stockpile.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
I think of most interest to a TED audience

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
would be the new generation of reactors

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
that are very small,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
down around 10

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
to 125 megawatts.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
This is one from Toshiba.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Here's one the Russians are already building that floats on a barge.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
And that would be very interesting in the developing world.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Typically, these things are put in the ground.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
They're referred to as nuclear batteries.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
They're incredibly safe,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
weapons proliferation-proof and all the rest of it.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Here is a commercial version from New Mexico

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
called the Hyperion,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and another one from Oregon called NuScale.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Babcock &amp; Wilcox that make nuclear reactors,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
here's an integral fast reactor.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Thorium reactor that Nathan Myhrvold's involved in.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
The governments of the world are going to have to decide

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
that coals need to be made expensive, and these will go ahead.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
And here's the future.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
(Applause)

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
CA: Okay. Okay.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
(Applause)

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
So arguing against,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
a man who's been at the nitty, gritty heart

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
of the energy debate and the climate change debate for years.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
In 2000, he discovered that soot

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
was probably the second leading cause of global warming, after CO2.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
His team have been making detailed calculations

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
of the relative impacts

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
of different energy sources.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
His first time at TED, possibly a disadvantage -- we shall see --

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
from Stanford,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Professor Mark Jacobson. Good luck.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Mark Jacobson: Thank you.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
(Applause)

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
So my premise here is that nuclear energy

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
puts out more carbon dioxide,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
puts out more air pollutants,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
enhances mortality more and takes longer to put up

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
than real renewable energy systems,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
namely wind, solar,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
geothermal power, hydro-tidal wave power.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
And it also enhances nuclear weapons proliferation.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
So let's start just by looking at the

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
CO2 emissions from the life cycle.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
CO2e emissions are equivalent emissions

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
of all the greenhouse gases and particles

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
that cause warming

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
and converted to CO2.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
And if you look, wind and concentrated solar

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
have the lowest CO2 emissions, if you look at the graph.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Nuclear -- there are two bars here.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
One is a low estimate, and one is a high estimate.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
The low estimate is the nuclear energy industry

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
estimate of nuclear.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
The high is the average of 103

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
scientific, peer-reviewed studies.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
And this is just the

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
CO2 from the life cycle.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
If we look at the delays,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
it takes between 10 and 19 years

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
to put up a nuclear power plant

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
from planning to operation.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
This includes about three and a half to six years

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
for a site permit.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
and another two and a half to four years

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
for a construction permit and issue,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
and then four to nine years for actual construction.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
And in China, right now,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
they're putting up five gigawatts of nuclear.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
And the average, just for the construction time of these,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
is 7.1 years

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
on top of any planning times.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
While you're waiting around for your nuclear,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
you have to run the regular electric power grid,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
which is mostly coal in the United States and around the world.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
And the chart here shows the difference between

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
the emissions from the regular grid,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
resulting if you use nuclear, or anything else,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
versus wind, CSP or photovoltaics.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Wind takes about two to five years on average,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
same as concentrated solar and photovoltaics.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
So the difference is the opportunity cost

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
of using nuclear versus wind, or something else.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
So if you add these two together, alone,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
you can see a separation

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
that nuclear puts out at least nine to 17 times

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
more CO2 equivalent emissions than wind energy.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
And this doesn't even account

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
for the footprint on the ground.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
If you look at the air pollution health effects,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
this is the number of deaths per year in 2020

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
just from vehicle exhaust.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Let's say we converted all the vehicles in the United States

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
to battery electric vehicles, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
or flex fuel vehicles run on E85.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Well, right now in the United States,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
50 to 100,000 people die per year from air pollution,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
and vehicles are about 25,000 of those.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
In 2020, the number will go down to 15,000

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
due to improvements.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
And so, on the right, you see gasoline emissions,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
the death rates of 2020.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
If you go to corn or cellulosic ethanol,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
you'd actually increase the death rate slightly.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
If you go to nuclear,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
you do get a big reduction,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
but it's not as much as with wind and concentrated solar.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Now if you consider the fact

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
that nuclear weapons proliferation

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
is associated with nuclear energy proliferation,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
because we know for example,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
India and Pakistan developed nuclear weapons secretly

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
by enriching uranium

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
in nuclear energy facilities.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
North Korea did that to some extent.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Iran is doing that right now.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
And Venezuela would be doing it

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
if they started with their nuclear energy facilities.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
If you do a large scale expansion

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
of nuclear energy across the world,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
and as a result there was just one

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
nuclear bomb created

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
that was used to destroy a city

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
such as Mumbai or some other big city, megacity,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
the additional death rates due to this

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
averaged over 30 years and then scaled to the population of the U.S.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
would be this.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
So, do we need this?

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
The next thing is: What about the footprint? Stewart mentioned the footprint.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Actually, the footprint on the ground for wind

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
is by far the smallest of any energy source in the world.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
That, because the footprint, as you can see,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
is just the pole touching the ground.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
And you can power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
with 73,000 to 145,000

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
five-megawatt wind turbines.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
That would take between one and three square kilometers

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
of footprint on the ground, entirely.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
The spacing is something else.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
That's the footprint that is always being confused.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
People confuse footprint with spacing.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
As you can see from these pictures,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
the spacing between can be used for multiple purposes

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
including agricultural land,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
range land or open space.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Over the ocean, it's not even land.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Now if we look at nuclear -- (Laughter)

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
With nuclear, what do we have?

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
We have facilities around there. You also have a buffer zone

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
that's 17 square kilometers.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
And you have the uranium mining

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
that you have to deal with.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Now if we go to the area,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
lots is worse than nuclear or wind.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
For example, cellulosic ethanol, to power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
this is how much land you would need.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
That's cellulosic, second generation

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
biofuels from prairie grass.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Here's corn ethanol. It's smaller.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
This is based on ranges from data,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
but if you look at nuclear,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
it would be the size of Rhode Island to power the U.S. vehicle fleet.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
For wind, there's a larger area,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
but much smaller footprint.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
And of course, with wind,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
you could put it all over the East Coast,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
offshore theoretically, or you can split it up.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
And now, if you go back to

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
looking at geothermal, it's even smaller than both,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
and solar is slightly larger than the nuclear spacing,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
but it's still pretty small.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
And this is to power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
To power the entire world with 50 percent wind,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
you would need about one percent of world land.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Matching the reliability, base load is actually irrelevant.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
We want to match the hour-by-hour power supply.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
You can do that by combining renewables.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
This is from real data in California,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
looking at wind data and solar data.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And it considers just using existing hydro

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
to match the hour-by-hour power demand.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Here are the world wind resources.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
There's five to 10 times more wind available worldwide

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
than we need for all the world.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
So then here's the final ranking.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
And one last slide I just want to show. This is the choice:

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
You can either have wind or nuclear.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
If you use wind,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
you guarantee ice will last.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Nuclear, the time lag alone

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
will allow the Arctic to melt and other places to melt more.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
And we can guarantee a clean, blue sky

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
or an uncertain future with nuclear power.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:55.000
(Applause)

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
CA: All right.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
So while they're having their comebacks on each other --

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
and yours is slightly short because you slightly overran --

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
I need two people from either side.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
So if you're for this,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
if you're for nuclear power, put up two hands.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
If you're against, put up one.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
And I want two of each for the mics.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Now then, you guys have --

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
you have a minute comeback on him

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
to pick up a point he said, challenge it,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
whatever.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
SB: I think a point of difference we're having, Mark,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
has to do with weapons

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
and energy.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
These diagrams that show that nuclear is somehow

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
putting out a lot of greenhouse gases --

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
a lot of those studies include, "Well of course war will be inevitable

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
and therefore we'll have cities burning and stuff like that,"

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
which is kind of finessing it

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
a little bit, I think.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
The reality is that there's, what,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
21 nations that have nuclear power?

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Of those, seven have nuclear weapons.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
In every case, they got the weapons

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
before they got the nuclear power.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
There are two nations, North Korea and Israel,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
that have nuclear weapons

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
and don't have nuclear power at all.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
The places that we would most like to have

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
really clean energy occur

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
are China, India, Europe, North America,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
all of which have sorted out their situation

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
in relation to nuclear weapons.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
So that leaves a couple of places like Iran,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
maybe Venezuela,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
that you would like to have very close

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
surveillance of anything

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
that goes on with fissile stuff.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Pushing ahead with nuclear power will mean we

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
really know where all of the fissile material is,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
and we can move toward

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
zero weapons left, once we know all that.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
CA: Mark,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
30 seconds, either on that or on anything Stewart said.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
MJ: Well we know India and Pakistan had nuclear energy first,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
and then they developed nuclear weapons secretly in the factories.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
So the other thing is, we don't need nuclear energy.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
There's plenty of solar and wind.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
You can make it reliable, as I showed with that diagram.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
That's from real data.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
And this is an ongoing research. This is not rocket science.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Solving the world's problems can be done,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
if you really put your mind to it and use clean, renewable energy.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
There's absolutely no need for nuclear power.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
(Applause)

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
CA: We need someone for.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Rod Beckstrom: Thank you Chris. I'm Rod Beckstrom, CEO of ICANN.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
I've been involved in global warming policy

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
since 1994,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
when I joined the board of Environmental Defense Fund

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
that was one of the crafters of the Kyoto Protocol.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
And I want to support Stewart Brand's position.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
I've come around in the last 10 years.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
I used to be against nuclear power.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
I'm now supporting Stewart's position,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
softly, from a risk-management standpoint,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
agreeing that

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
the risks of overheating the planet

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
outweigh the risk of nuclear incident,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
which certainly is possible and is a very real problem.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
However, I think there may be a win-win solution here

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
where both parties can win this debate,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
and that is, we face a situation

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
where it's carbon caps on this planet

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
or die.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
And in the United States Senate,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
we need bipartisan support --

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
only one or two votes are needed --

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
to move global warming through the Senate,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
and this room can help.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
So if we get that through, then Mark will solve these problems. Thanks Chris.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
CA: Thank you Rod Beckstrom. Against.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
David Fanton: Hi, I'm David Fanton. I just want to say a couple quick things.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
The first is: be aware of the propaganda.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
The propaganda from the industry

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
has been very, very strong.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
And we have not had

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
the other side of the argument fully aired

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
so that people can draw their own conclusions.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Be very aware of the propaganda.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
Secondly, think about this.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
If we build all these nuclear power plants,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
all that waste

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
is going to be on hundreds, if not thousands,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
of trucks and trains,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
moving through this country every day.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
Tell me they're not going to have accidents.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Tell me that those accidents aren't going to

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
put material into the environment

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
that is poisonous for hundreds of thousands of years.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
And then tell me that each and every one of those trucks and trains

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
isn't a potential terrorist target.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
CA: Thank you.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
For.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Anyone else for? Go.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Alex: Hi, I'm Alex. I just wanted to say,

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
I'm, first of all, renewable energy's biggest fan.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
I've got solar PV on my roof.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
I've got a hydro conversion

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
at a watermill that I own.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
And I'm, you know, very much "pro" that kind of stuff.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
However, there's a basic arithmetic problem here.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
The capability of

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
the sun shining, the wind blowing and the rain falling,

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
simply isn't enough to add up.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
So if we want to keep the lights on,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
we actually need a solution

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
which is going to keep generating all of the time.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
I campaigned against nuclear weapons in the '80s,

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
and I continue to do so now.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
But we've got an opportunity

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
to recycle them into something more useful

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
that enables us to get energy all of the time.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
And, ultimately, the arithmetic problem isn't going to go away.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
We're not going to get enough energy from renewables alone.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
We need a solution that generates all of the time.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
If we're going to keep the lights on,

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
nuclear is that solution.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
CA: Thank you.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Anyone else against?

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
Man: The last person who was in favor made the premise

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
that we don't have enough

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
alternative renewable resources.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
And our "against" proponent up here

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
made it very clear that we actually do.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
And so the fallacy

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
that we need this resource

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
and we can actually make it in a time frame

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
that is meaningful is not possible.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
I will also add one other thing.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
Ray Kurzweil and all the other talks --

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
we know that the stick is going up exponentially.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000
So you can't look at state-of-the-art technologies in renewables

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
and say, "That's all we have."

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Because five years from now, it will blow you away

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
what we'll actually have as alternatives

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
to this horrible, disastrous nuclear power.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
CA: Point well made. Thank you.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000
(Applause)

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
So each of you has really just a couple sentences --

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
30 seconds each

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
to sum up.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
Your final pitch, Stewart.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
SB: I loved your "It all balances out" chart

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000
that you had there.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
It was a sunny day and a windy night.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000
And just now in England

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
they had a cold spell.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
All of the wind in the entire country

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
shut down for a week.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000
None of those things were stirring.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000
And as usual, they had to buy nuclear power from France.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Two gigawatts comes through the Chunnel.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
This keeps happening.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
I used to worry about the 10,000 year factor.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
And the fact is, we're going to use the nuclear waste we have for fuel

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
in the fourth generation of reactors that are coming along.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:30.000
And especially the small reactors need to go forward.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000
I heard from Nathan Myhrvold -- and I think here's the action point --

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
it'll take an act of Congress

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
to make the Nuclear Regulatory Commission

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
start moving quickly on these small reactors,

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000
which we need very much, here and in the world.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:49.000
(Applause)

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
MJ: So we've analyzed the hour-by-hour

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
power demand and supply,

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000
looking at solar, wind, using data for California.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
And you can match that demand, hour-by-hour,

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
for the whole year almost.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000
Now, with regard to the resources,

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.000
we've developed the first wind map of the world,

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
from data alone, at 80 meters.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
We know what the wind resources are. You can cover 15 percent.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000
Fifteen percent of the entire U.S.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000
has wind at fast enough speeds to be cost-competitive.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
And there's much more solar than there is wind.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000
There's plenty of resource. You can make it reliable.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000
CA: Okay. So, thank you, Mark.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000
(Applause)

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000
So if you were in Palm Springs ...

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000
(Laughter)

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
(Applause)

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000
Shameless. Shameless. Shameless.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000
(Applause)

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000
So, people of the TED community,

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
I put it to you that what the world needs now

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
is nuclear energy.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000
All those in favor, raise your hands.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000
(Shouts)

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
And all those against.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000
Ooooh.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000
Now that is -- my take on that ...

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000
Just put up ... Hands up, people who changed their minds during the debate,

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000
who voted differently.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000
Those of you who changed your mind

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
in favor of "for"

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000
put your hands up.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000
Okay. So here's the read on it.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000
Both people won supporters,

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000
but on my count,

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.000
the mood of the TED community shifted

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
from about 75 to 25

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
to about 65 to 35

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000
in favor, in favor.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
You both won. I congratulate both of you.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
Thank you for that.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000
(Applause)
