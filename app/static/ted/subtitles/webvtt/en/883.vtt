WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This is the venue

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
where, as a young man,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
some of the music that I wrote was first performed.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It was, remarkably,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
a pretty good sounding room.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
With all the uneven walls and all the crap everywhere,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
it actually sounded pretty good.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
This is a song that was recorded there.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
(Music)

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
This is not Talking Heads,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
in the picture anyway.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:34.000
(Music: "A Clean Break (Let's Work)" by Talking Heads)

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So the nature of the room

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
meant that words could be understood.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The lyrics of the songs could be pretty much understood.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The sound system was kind of decent.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And there wasn't a lot of reverberation in the room.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So the rhythms

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
could be pretty intact too,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
pretty concise.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Other places around the country had similar rooms.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
This is Tootsie's Orchid Lounge in Nashville.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
The music was in some ways different,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
but in structure and form,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
very much the same.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
The clientele behavior was very much the same too.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And so the bands at Tootsie's

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
or at CBGB's

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
had to play loud enough --

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
the volume had to be loud enough to overcome

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
people falling down, shouting out

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and doing whatever else they were doing.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Since then, I've played other places

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
that are much nicer.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I've played the Disney Hall here

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and Carnegie Hall and places like that.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And it's been very exciting.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
But I also noticed that sometimes the music

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
that I had written,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
or was writing at the time,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
didn't sound all that great

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
in some of those halls.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
We managed,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
but sometimes those halls didn't seem exactly suited

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
to the music I was making

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
or had made.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
So I asked myself:

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Do I write stuff

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
for specific rooms?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Do I have a place, a venue,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
in mind when I write?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Is that a kind of model for creativity?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Do we all make things with

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
a venue, a context, in mind?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Okay, Africa.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.000
(Music: "Wenlenga" / Various artists)

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Most of the popular music that we know now

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
has a big part of its roots in West Africa.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And the music there,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I would say, the instruments,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
the intricate rhythms,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
the way it's played, the setting, the context,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
it's all perfect. It all works perfect.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
The music works perfectly in that setting.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
There's no big room

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
to create reverberation and confuse the rhythms.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
The instruments are loud enough

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
that they can be heard without amplification, etc., etc.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
It's no accident.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
It's perfect for that particular context.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And it would be a mess

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
in a context like this. This is a gothic cathedral.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
(Music: "Spem In Alium" by Thomas Tallis)

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
In a gothic cathedral, this kind of music is perfect.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
It doesn't change key, the notes are long,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
there's almost no rhythm whatsoever,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and the room flatters the music.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
It actually improves it.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
This is the room that Bach

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
wrote some of his music for. This is the organ.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
It's not as big as a gothic cathedral,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
so he can write things that are a little bit more intricate.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
He can, very innovatively,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
actually change keys

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
without risking huge dissonances.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:45.000
(Music: "Fantasia On Jesu, Mein Freunde" by Johann S. Bach)

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
This is a little bit later.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
This is the kind of rooms that Mozart wrote in.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
I think we're in like 1770, somewhere around there.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
They're smaller, even less reverberant,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
so he can write really frilly music

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
that's very intricate -- and it works.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
(Music: "Sonata in F," KV 13, by Wolfgang A. Mozart)

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
It fits the room perfectly.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
This is La Scala.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
It's around the same time,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
I think it was built around 1776.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
People in the audience in these opera houses, when they were built,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
they used to yell out to one another.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
They used to eat, drink and yell out to people on the stage,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
just like they do at CBGB's and places like that.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
If they liked an aria,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
they would holler and suggest

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
that it be done again as an encore,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
not at the end of the show, but immediately.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
(Laughter)

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
And well, that was an opera experience.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
This is the opera house that Wagner built for himself.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
And the size of the room is not that big.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
It's smaller than this.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
But Wagner made an innovation.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
He wanted a bigger band.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
He wanted a little more bombast,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
so he increased the size of the orchestra pit

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
so he could get more low-end instruments in there.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:12.000
(Music: "Lohengrin / Prelude to Act III" by Richard Wagner)

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Okay.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
This is Carnegie Hall.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Obviously, this kind of thing became popular.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
The halls got bigger. Carnegie Hall's fair-sized.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
It's larger than some of the other symphony halls.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
And they're a lot more reverberant

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
than La Scala.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Around the same,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
according to Alex Ross who writes for the New Yorker,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
this kind of rule came into effect

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
that audiences had to be quiet --

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
no more eating, drinking and yelling at the stage,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
or gossiping with one another

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
during the show.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
They had to be very quiet.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
So those two things combined meant that

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
a different kind of music

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
worked best in these kind of halls.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
It meant that there could be extreme dynamics,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
which there weren't in some of these

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
other kinds of music.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Quiet parts could be heard

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
that would have been drowned out

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
by all the gossiping and shouting.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
But because of the reverberation

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
in those rooms like Carnegie Hall,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
the music had to be maybe a little less rhythmic

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
and a little more textural.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
(Music: "Symphony No. 8 in E Flat Major" by Gustav Mahler)

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
This is Mahler.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
It looks like Bob Dylan, but it's Mahler.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
That was Bob's last record, yeah.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
(Laughter)

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Popular music, coming along at the same time.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
This is a jazz band.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
According to Scott Joplin, the bands were playing

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
on riverboats and clubs.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Again, it's noisy. They're playing for dancers.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
There's certain sections of the song -- the songs had different sections

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
that the dancers really liked.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And they'd say, "Play that part again."

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Well, there's only so many times

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
you can play the same section of a song over and over again for the dancers.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
So the bands started to improvise new melodies.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
And a new form of music was born.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:11.000
(Music: "Royal Garden Blues" by W.C. Handy / Ethel Waters)

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
These are played mainly in small rooms.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
People are dancing, shouting and drinking.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
So the music has to be loud enough

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
to be heard above that.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Same thing goes true for -- that's the beginning of the century --

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
for the whole of 20th-century popular music,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
whether it's rock or Latin music or whatever.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
[Live music] doesn't really change that much.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
It changes about a third of the way into the 20th century,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
when this became

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
one of the primary venues for music.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
And this was one way

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
that the music got there.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Microphones enabled singers, in particular,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
and musicians and composers,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
to completely change the kind of music

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
that they were writing.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
So far, a lot of the stuff that was on the radio was live music,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
but singers, like Frank Sinatra,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
could use the mic

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
and do things

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
that they could never do without a microphone.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Other singers after him

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
went even further.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:18.000
(Music: "My Funny Valentine" by Chet Baker)

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
This is Chet Baker.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And this kind of thing

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
would have been impossible without a microphone.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
It would have been impossible without recorded music as well.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
And he's singing right into your ear.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
He's whispering into your ears.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
The effect is just electric.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
It's like the guy is sitting next to you,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
whispering who knows what into your ear.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
So at this point, music diverged.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
There's live music,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
and there's recorded music.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
And they no longer have to be exactly the same.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Now there's venues like this, a discotheque,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
and there's jukeboxes in bars,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
where you don't even need to have a band.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
There doesn't need to be any

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
live performing musicians whatsoever,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
and the sound systems are good.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
People began to make music

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
specifically for discos

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
and for those sound systems.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
And, as with jazz,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
the dancers liked certain sections

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
more than they did others.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
So the early hip-hop guys would loop certain sections.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:30.000
(Music: "Rapper's Delight" by The Sugarhill Gang)

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
The MC would improvise lyrics

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
in the same way that the jazz players would improvise melodies.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And another new form of music was born.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Live performance, when it was incredibly successful,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
ended up in what is probably, acoustically,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
the worst sounding venues on the planet:

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
sports stadiums,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
basketball arenas and hockey arenas.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Musicians who ended up there did the best they could.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
They wrote what is now called arena rock,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
which is medium-speed ballads.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:07.000
(Music: "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" by U2)

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
They did the best they could

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
given that this is what they're writing for.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
The tempos are medium. It sounds big.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
It's more a social situation

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
than a musical situation.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
And in some ways, the music

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
that they're writing for this place

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
works perfectly.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
So there's more new venues.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
One of the new ones is the automobile.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
I grew up with a radio in a car.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
But now that's evolved into something else.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
The car is a whole venue.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000
(Music: "Who U Wit" by Lil' Jon &amp; the East Side Boyz)

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
The music that, I would say, is written

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
for automobile sound systems

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
works perfectly on it.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
It might not be what you want to listen to at home,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
but it works great in the car --

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
has a huge frequency spectrum,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
you know, big bass and high-end

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
and the voice kind of stuck in the middle.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Automobile music, you can share with your friends.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
There's one other kind of new venue,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
the private MP3 player.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Presumably, this is just for Christian music.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
(Laughter)

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
And in some ways it's like Carnegie Hall,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
or when the audience had to hush up,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
because you can now hear every single detail.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
In other ways, it's more like the West African music

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
because if the music in an MP3 player gets too quiet,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
you turn it up, and the next minute,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
your ears are blasted out by a louder passage.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
So that doesn't really work.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
I think pop music, mainly,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
it's written today,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
to some extent, is written for these kind of players,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
for this kind of personal experience

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
where you can hear extreme detail,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
but the dynamic doesn't change that much.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
So I asked myself:

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Okay, is this

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
a model for creation,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
this adaptation that we do?

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
And does it happen anywhere else?

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Well, according to David Attenborough and some other people,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
birds do it too --

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
that the birds in the canopy,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
where the foliage is dense,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
their calls tend to be

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
high-pitched, short and repetitive.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
And the birds on the floor

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
tend to have lower pitched calls,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
so that they don't get distorted

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
when they bounce off the forest floor.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
And birds like this Savannah sparrow,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
they tend to have a buzzing

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
(Sound clip: Savannah sparrow song)

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
type call.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
And it turns out that

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
a sound like this

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
is the most energy efficient and practical way

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
to transmit their call

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
across the fields and savannahs.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Other birds, like this tanager,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
have adapted within the same species.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
The tananger on the East Coast of the United States,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
where the forests are a little denser,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
has one kind of call,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
and the tananger on the other side, on the west

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
(Sound clip: Scarlet tanager song)

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
has a different kind of call.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
(Sound clip: Scarlet tanager song)

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
So birds do it too.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
And I thought:

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Well, if this is a model for creation,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
if we make music,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
primarily the form at least,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
to fit these contexts,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
and if we make art to fit gallery walls or museum walls,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
and if we write software to fit existing operating systems,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
is that how it works?

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Yeah. I think it's evolutionary.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
It's adaptive.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
But the pleasure and the passion and the joy

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
is still there.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
This is a reverse view of things

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
from the kind of traditional Romantic view.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
The Romantic view is that

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
first comes the passion

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
and then the outpouring of emotion,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
and then somehow it gets shaped into something.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
And I'm saying,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
well, the passion's still there,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
but the vessel

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
that it's going to be injected into and poured into,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
that is instinctively and intuitively

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
created first.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
We already know where that passion is going.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
But this conflict of views is kind of interesting.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
The writer,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Thomas Frank,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
says that

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
this might be a kind of explanation

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
why some voters vote

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
against their best interests,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
that voters, like a lot of us,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
assume, that if they hear something that sounds like it's sincere,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
that it's coming from the gut, that it's passionate,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
that it's more authentic.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
And they'll vote for that.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
So that, if somebody can fake sincerity,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
if they can fake passion,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
they stand a better chance

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
of being selected in that way,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
which seems a little dangerous.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
I'm saying the two, the passion, the joy,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
are not mutually exclusive.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Maybe what the world needs now is for us to realize

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
that we are like the birds.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
We adapt.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
We sing.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
And like the birds, the joy is still there,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
even though we have changed what we do

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
to fit the context.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Thank you very much.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
(Applause)
