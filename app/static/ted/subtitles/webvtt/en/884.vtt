WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So since I was here last in '06,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
we discovered that global climate change

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
is turning out to be a pretty serious issue,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
so we covered that fairly extensively

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
in Skeptic magazine.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We investigate all kinds

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
of scientific and quasi-scientific controversies,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
but it turns out we don't have to worry about any of this

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
because the world's going to end in 2012.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Another update:

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
You will recall I introduced you guys

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
to the Quadro Tracker.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It's like a water dowsing device.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It's just a hollow piece of plastic with an antenna that swivels around.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And you walk around, and it points to things.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Like if you're looking for marijuana in students' lockers,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
it'll point right to somebody.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Oh, sorry. (Laughter)

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
This particular one that was given to me

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
finds golf balls,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
especially if you're at a golf course

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and you check under enough bushes.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Well, under the category of "What's the harm of silly stuff like this?"

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
this device, the ADE 651,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
was sold to the Iraqi government

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
for 40,000 dollars apiece.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
It's just like this one, completely worthless,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
in which it allegedly worked by "electrostatic

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
magnetic ion attraction,"

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
which translates to

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
"pseudoscientific baloney" -- would be the nice word --

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
in which you string together a bunch of words that sound good,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
but it does absolutely nothing.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
In this case, at trespass points,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
allowing people to go through

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
because your little tracker device said they were okay,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
actually cost lives.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
So there is a danger to pseudoscience,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
in believing in this sort of thing.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
So what I want to talk about today is belief.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I want to believe,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and you do too.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And in fact, I think my thesis here is that

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
belief is the natural state of things.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
It is the default option. We just believe.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
We believe all sorts of things.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Belief is natural;

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
disbelief, skepticism, science, is not natural.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
It's more difficult.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
It's uncomfortable to not believe things.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
So like Fox Mulder on "X-Files,"

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
who wants to believe in UFOs? Well, we all do,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and the reason for that is because

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
we have a belief engine in our brains.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Essentially, we are pattern-seeking primates.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
We connect the dots: A is connected to B; B is connected to C.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And sometimes A really is connected to B,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and that's called association learning.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
We find patterns, we make those connections,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
whether it's Pavlov's dog here

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
associating the sound of the bell with the food,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and then he salivates to the sound of the bell,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
or whether it's a Skinnerian rat,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
in which he's having an association

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
between his behavior and a reward for it,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and therefore he repeats the behavior.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
In fact, what Skinner discovered

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
is that, if you put a pigeon in a box like this,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and he has to press one of these two keys,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and he tries to figure out what the pattern is,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and you give him a little reward in the hopper box there --

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
if you just randomly assign rewards

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
such that there is no pattern,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
they will figure out any kind of pattern.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
And whatever they were doing just before they got the reward,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
they repeat that particular pattern.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Sometimes it was even spinning around twice counterclockwise,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
once clockwise and peck the key twice.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
And that's called superstition,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and that, I'm afraid,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
we will always have with us.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
I call this process "patternicity" --

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
that is, the tendency to find meaningful patterns

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
in both meaningful and meaningless noise.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
When we do this process, we make two types of errors.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
A Type I error, or false positive,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
is believing a pattern is real

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
when it's not.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Our second type of error is a false negative.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
A Type II error is not believing

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
a pattern is real when it is.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
So let's do a thought experiment.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
You are a hominid three million years ago

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
walking on the plains of Africa.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Your name is Lucy, okay?

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And you hear a rustle in the grass.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Is it a dangerous predator,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
or is it just the wind?

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Your next decision could be the most important one of your life.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Well, if you think that the rustle in the grass is a dangerous predator

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and it turns out it's just the wind,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
you've made an error in cognition,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
made a Type I error, false positive.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
But no harm. You just move away.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
You're more cautious. You're more vigilant.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
On the other hand, if you believe that the rustle in the grass is just the wind,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
and it turns out it's a dangerous predator,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
you're lunch.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
You've just won a Darwin award.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
You've been taken out of the gene pool.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Now the problem here is that

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
patternicities will occur whenever the cost

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
of making a Type I error

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
is less than the cost of making a Type II error.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
This is the only equation in the talk by the way.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
We have a pattern detection problem

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
that is assessing the difference between a Type I and a Type II error

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
is highly problematic,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
especially in split-second, life-and-death situations.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
So the default position

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
is just: Believe all patterns are real --

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
All rustles in the grass are dangerous predators

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
and not just the wind.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
And so I think that we evolved ...

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
there was a natural selection for the propensity for our belief engines,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
our pattern-seeking brain processes,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
to always find meaningful patterns

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
and infuse them with these sort of

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
predatory or intentional agencies that I'll come back to.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
So for example, what do you see here?

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
It's a horse head, that's right.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
It looks like a horse. It must be a horse.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
That's a pattern.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
And is it really a horse?

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Or is it more like a frog?

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
See, our pattern detection device,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
which appears to be located in the anterior cingulate cortex --

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
it's our little detection device there --

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
can be easily fooled, and this is the problem.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
For example, what do you see here?

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Yes, of course, it's a cow.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Once I prime the brain -- it's called cognitive priming --

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
once I prime the brain to see it,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
it pops back out again even without the pattern that I've imposed on it.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
And what do you see here?

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Some people see a Dalmatian dog.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Yes, there it is. And there's the prime.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
So when I go back without the prime,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
your brain already has the model

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
so you can see it again.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
What do you see here?

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Planet Saturn. Yes, that's good.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
How about here?

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Just shout out anything you see.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
That's a good audience, Chris.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Because there's nothing in this. Well, allegedly there's nothing.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
This is an experiment done by Jennifer Whitson

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
at U.T. Austin

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
on corporate environments

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
and whether feelings of uncertainty and out of control

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
makes people see illusory patterns.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
That is, almost everybody sees the planet Saturn.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
People that are put in a condition of feeling out of control

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
are more likely to see something in this,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
which is allegedly patternless.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
In other words, the propensity to find these patterns

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
goes up when there's a lack of control.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
For example, baseball players are notoriously superstitious

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
when they're batting,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
but not so much when they're fielding.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Because fielders are successful

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
90 to 95 percent of the time.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
The best batters fail seven out of 10 times.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
So their superstitions, their patternicities,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
are all associated with feelings of lack of control

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
and so forth.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
What do you see in this particular one here, in this field?

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Anybody see an object there?

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
There actually is something here,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
but it's degraded.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
While you're thinking about that,

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
this was an experiment done by Susan Blackmore,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
a psychologist in England,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
who showed subjects this degraded image

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
and then ran a correlation between

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
their scores on an ESP test:

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
How much did they believe in the paranormal,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
supernatural, angels and so forth.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
And those who scored high on the ESP scale,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
tended to not only see

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
more patterns in the degraded images

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
but incorrect patterns.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Here is what you show subjects.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
The fish is degraded 20 percent, 50 percent

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
and then the one I showed you,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
70 percent.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
A similar experiment was done by another [Swiss] psychologist

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
named Peter Brugger,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
who found significantly more meaningful patterns

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
were perceived on the right hemisphere,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
via the left visual field, than the left hemisphere.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
So if you present subjects the images such

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
that it's going to end up on the right hemisphere instead of the left,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
then they're more likely to see patterns

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
than if you put it on the left hemisphere.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Our right hemisphere appears to be

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
where a lot of this patternicity occurs.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
So what we're trying to do is bore into the brain

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
to see where all this happens.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Brugger and his colleague, Christine Mohr,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
gave subjects L-DOPA.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
L-DOPA's a drug, as you know, given for treating Parkinson's disease,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
which is related to a decrease in dopamine.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
L-DOPA increases dopamine.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
An increase of dopamine caused

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
subjects to see more patterns

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
than those that did not receive the dopamine.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
So dopamine appears to be the drug

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
associated with patternicity.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
In fact, neuroleptic drugs

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
that are used to eliminate psychotic behavior,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
things like paranoia, delusions

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
and hallucinations,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
these are patternicities.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
They're incorrect patterns. They're false positives. They're Type I errors.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
And if you give them drugs

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
that are dopamine antagonists,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
they go away.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
That is, you decrease the amount of dopamine,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
and their tendency to see

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
patterns like that decreases.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
On the other hand, amphetamines like cocaine

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
are dopamine agonists.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
They increase the amount of dopamine.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
So you're more likely to feel in a euphoric state,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
creativity, find more patterns.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
In fact, I saw Robin Williams recently

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
talk about how he thought he was much funnier

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
when he was doing cocaine, when he had that issue, than now.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
So perhaps more dopamine

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
is related to more creativity.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Dopamine, I think, changes

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
our signal-to-noise ratio.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
That is, how accurate we are

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
in finding patterns.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
If it's too low, you're more likely to make too many Type II errors.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
You miss the real patterns. You don't want to be too skeptical.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
If you're too skeptical, you'll miss the really interesting good ideas.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Just right, you're creative, and yet you don't fall for too much baloney.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Too high and maybe you see patterns everywhere.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Every time somebody looks at you, you think people are staring at you.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
You think people are talking about you.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
And if you go too far on that, that's just simply

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
labeled as madness.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
It's a distinction perhaps we might make

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
between two Nobel laureates, Richard Feynman

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
and John Nash.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
One sees maybe just the right number

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
of patterns to win a Nobel Prize.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
The other one also, but maybe too many patterns.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
And we then call that schizophrenia.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
So the signal-to-noise ratio then presents us with a pattern-detection problem.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And of course you all know exactly

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
what this is, right?

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
And what pattern do you see here?

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Again, I'm putting your anterior cingulate cortex to the test here,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
causing you conflicting pattern detections.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
You know, of course, this is Via Uno shoes.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
These are sandals.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Pretty sexy feet, I must say.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Maybe a little Photoshopped.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
And of course, the ambiguous figures

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
that seem to flip-flop back and forth.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
It turns out what you're thinking about a lot

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
influences what you

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
tend to see.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
And you see the lamp here, I know.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Because the lights on here.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Of course, thanks to the environmentalist movement

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
we're all sensitive to the plight of marine mammals.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
So what you see in this particular ambiguous figure

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
is, of course, the dolphins, right?

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
You see a dolphin here,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
and there's a dolphin,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
and there's a dolphin.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
That's a dolphin tail there, guys.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
(Laughter)

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
If we can give you conflicting data, again,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
your ACC is going to be going into hyperdrive.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
If you look down here, it's fine. If you look up here, then you get conflicting data.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
And then we have to flip the image

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
for you to see that it's a set up.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
The impossible crate illusion.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
It's easy to fool the brain in 2D.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
So you say, "Aw, come on Shermer, anybody can do that

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
in a Psych 101 text with an illusion like that."

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Well here's the late, great Jerry Andrus'

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
"impossible crate" illusion in 3D,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
in which Jerry is standing inside

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
the impossible crate.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
And he was kind enough to post this

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
and give us the reveal.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Of course, camera angle is everything. The photographer is over there,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
and this board appears to overlap with this one, and this one with that one, and so on.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
But even when I take it away,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
the illusion is so powerful because of how are brains are wired

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
to find those certain kinds of patterns.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
This is a fairly new one

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
that throws us off because of the conflicting patterns

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
of comparing this angle with that angle.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
In fact, it's the exact same picture side by side.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
So what you're doing is comparing that angle

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
instead of with this one, but with that one.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
And so your brain is fooled.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Yet again, your pattern detection devices are fooled.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Faces are easy to see

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
because we have an additional evolved

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
facial recognition software

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
in our temporal lobes.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Here's some faces on the side of a rock.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
I'm actually not even sure if this is -- this might be Photoshopped.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
But anyway, the point is still made.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Now which one of these looks odd to you?

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
In a quick reaction, which one looks odd?

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
The one on the left. Okay. So I'll rotate it

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
so it'll be the one on the right.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
And you are correct.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
A fairly famous illusion -- it was first done with Margaret Thatcher.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Now, they trade up the politicians every time.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Well, why is this happening?

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Well, we know exactly where it happens,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
in the temporal lobe, right across, sort of above your ear there,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
in a little structure called the fusiform gyrus.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
And there's two types of cells that do this,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
that record facial features either globally,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
or specifically these large, rapid-firing cells,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
first look at the general face.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
So you recognize Obama immediately.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
And then you notice something quite

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
a little bit odd about the eyes and the mouth.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Especially when they're upside down,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
you're engaging that general facial recognition software there.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Now I said back in our little thought experiment,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
you're a hominid walking on the plains of Africa.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Is it just the wind or a dangerous predator?

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
What's the difference between those?

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Well, the wind is inanimate;

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
the dangerous predator is an intentional agent.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
And I call this process agenticity.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
That is the tendency to infuse patterns

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
with meaning, intention and agency,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
often invisible beings from the top down.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
This is an idea that we got

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
from a fellow TEDster here, Dan Dennett,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
who talked about taking the intentional stance.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
So it's a type of that expanded to explain, I think, a lot of different things:

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
souls, spirits, ghosts, gods, demons, angels,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
aliens, intelligent designers,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
government conspiracists

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
and all manner of invisible agents

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
with power and intention, are believed

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
to haunt our world and control our lives.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
I think it's the basis of animism

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
and polytheism and monotheism.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
It's the belief that aliens are somehow

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
more advanced than us, more moral than us,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
and the narratives always are

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
that they're coming here to save us and rescue us from on high.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
The intelligent designer's always portrayed

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
as this super intelligent, moral being

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
that comes down to design life.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Even the idea that government can rescue us --

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
that's no longer the wave of the future,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
but that is, I think, a type of agenticity:

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
projecting somebody up there,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
big and powerful, will come rescue us.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
And this is also, I think, the basis of conspiracy theories.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
There's somebody hiding behind there pulling the strings,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
whether it's the Illuminati

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
or the Bilderbergers.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
But this is a pattern detection problem, isn't it?

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Some patterns are real and some are not.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Was JFK assassinated by a conspiracy or by a lone assassin?

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Well, if you go there -- there's people there on any given day --

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
like when I went there, here -- showing me where the different shooters were.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
My favorite one was he was in the manhole.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
And he popped out at the last second, took that shot.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
But of course, Lincoln was assassinated by a conspiracy.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
So we can't just uniformly dismiss

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
all patterns like that.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Because, let's face it, some patterns are real.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Some conspiracies really are true.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Explains a lot, maybe.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
And 9/11 has a conspiracy theory. It is a conspiracy.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
We did a whole issue on it.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
Nineteen members of Al Queda plotting to fly planes into buildings

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
constitutes a conspiracy.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
But that's not what the "9/11 truthers" think.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
They think it was an inside job by the Bush administration.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Well, that's a whole other lecture.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
You know how we know that 9/11

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
was not orchestrated by the Bush administration?

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Because it worked.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
(Laughter)

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
(Applause)

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
So we are natural-born dualists.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Our agenticity process comes from

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
the fact that we can enjoy movies like these.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Because we can imagine, in essence,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
continuing on.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
We know that if you stimulate the temporal lobe,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
you can produce a feeling of out-of-body experiences,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
near-death experiences,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
which you can do by just touching an electrode to the temporal lobe there.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Or you can do it through loss of consciousness,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
by accelerating in a centrifuge.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
You get a hypoxia, or a lower oxygen.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
And the brain then senses

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
that there's an out-of-body experience.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
You can use -- which I did, went out and did --

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Michael Persinger's God Helmet,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
that bombards your temporal lobes with electromagnetic waves.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
And you get a sense of out-of-body experience.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
So I'm going to end here with a short video clip

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
that sort of brings all this together.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
It's just a minute and a half.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
It ties together all this into the power of expectation and the power of belief.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Go ahead and roll it.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Narrator: This is the venue they chose for their fake auditions

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
for an advert for lip balm.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Woman: We're hoping we can use part of this

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
in a national commercial, right?

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
And this is test on some lip balms

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
that we have over here.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
And these are our models who are going to help us,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Roger and Matt.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
And we have our own lip balm,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
and we have a leading brand.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Would you have any problem

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
kissing our models to test it?

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Girl: No.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Woman: You wouldn't? (Girl: No.) Woman: You'd think that was fine.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Girl: That would be fine. (Woman: Okay.)

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
So this is a blind test.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
I'm going to ask you to go ahead

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
and put a blindfold on.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Kay, now can you see anything? (Girl: No.)

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
Pull it so you can't even see down. (Girl: Okay.)

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Woman: It's completely blind now, right?

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
Girl: Yes. (Woman: Okay.)

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Now, what I'm going to be looking for in this test

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
is how it protects your lips,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
the texture, right,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
and maybe if you can discern any flavor or not.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Girl: Okay. (Woman: Have you ever done a kissing test before?)

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
Girl: No.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
Woman: Take a step here.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
Okay, now I'm going to ask you to pucker up.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Pucker up big and lean in just a little bit, okay?

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
(Music)

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.000
(Laughter)

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
(Laughter)

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
Woman: Okay.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
And, Jennifer, how did that feel?

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Jennifer: Good.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:28.000
(Laughter)

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Girl: Oh my God!

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
(Laughter)

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Michael Shermer: Thank you very much. Thank you. Thanks.
