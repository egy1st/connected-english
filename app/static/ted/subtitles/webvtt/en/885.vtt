00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So, if you're in the audience today,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
or maybe you're watching this talk in some other time or place,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
you are a participant in the digital rights ecosystem.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Whether you're an artist, a technologist,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
a lawyer or a fan,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
the handling of copyright directly impacts your life.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Rights management is no longer

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
simply a question of ownership,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
it's a complex web of relationships

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and a critical part of our cultural landscape.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
YouTube cares deeply about the rights of content owners,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
but in order to give them choices about what they can do

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
with copies, mashups and more,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
we need to first identify

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
when copyrighted material is uploaded to our site.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Let's look at a specific video so you can see how it works.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Two years ago, recording artist Chris Brown

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
released the official video of his single "Forever."

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
A fan saw it on TV,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
recorded it with her camera phone,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and uploaded it to YouTube.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Because Sony Music had registered Chris Brown's video

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
in our Content ID system,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
within seconds of attempting to upload the video,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
the copy was detected,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
giving Sony the choice of what to do next.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
But how do we know that the user's video was a copy?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Well, it starts with content owners

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
delivering assets into our database,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
along with a usage policy

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
that tells us what to do when we find a match.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
We compare each upload

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
against all of the reference files in our database.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
This heat map is going to show you

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
how the brain of the system works.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Here we can see the original reference file

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
being compared to the user generated content.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
The system compares every moment

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
of one to the other to see if there's a match.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
This means that we can identify a match

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
even if the copy used is just a portion of the original file,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
plays it in slow motion

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and has degraded audio and video quality.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And we do this every time

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
that a video is uploaded to YouTube.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And that's over 20 hours of video every minute.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
When we find a match,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
we apply the policy that the rights owner has set down.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And the scale and the speed of this system

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
is truly breathtaking.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
We're not just talking about a few videos,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
we're talking about over

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
100 years of video every day,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
between new uploads and the legacy scans

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
we regularly do across all of the content on the site.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
When we compare those hundred years of video,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
we're comparing it against millions

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
of reference files in our database.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
It would be like 36,000 people

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
staring at 36,000 monitors

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
each and every day, without so much as a coffee break.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Now, what do we do when we find a match?

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Well, most rights owners, instead of blocking,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
will allow the copy to be published.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And then they benefit through the exposure,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
advertising and linked sales.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Remember Chris Brown's video "Forever"?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Well, it had its day in the sun and then it dropped off the charts,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and that looked like the end of the story,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
but sometime last year, a young couple got married.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
This is their wedding video.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
You may have seen it.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
(Music)

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
What's amazing about this is,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
if the processional of the wedding was this much fun,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
can you imagine how much fun the reception must have been?

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
I mean, who are these people?

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I totally want to go to that wedding.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
So their little wedding video went on

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
to get over 40 million views.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
And instead of Sony blocking,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
they allowed the upload to occur.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
And they put advertising against it

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
and linked from it to iTunes.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And the song, 18 months old,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
went back to number four on the iTunes charts.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
So Sony is generating revenue from both of these.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And Jill and Kevin, the happy couple,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
they came back from their honeymoon

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
and found that their video had gone crazy viral.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
And they've ended up on a bunch of talk shows,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and they've used it as an opportunity to make a difference.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
The video's inspired over 26,000 dollars in donations

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
to end domestic violence.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
The "JK Wedding [Entrance] Dance" became so popular

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
that NBC parodied it on the season finale of "The Office,"

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
which just goes to show,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
it's truly an ecosystem of culture.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Because it's not just amateurs borrowing from big studios,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
but sometimes big studios borrowing back.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
By empowering choice, we can create a culture of opportunity.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And all it took to change things around

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
was to allow for choice through rights identification.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
So why has no one ever solved this problem before?

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
It's because it's a big problem,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
and it's complicated and messy.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
It's not uncommon for a single video

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
to have multiple rights owners.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
There's musical labels.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
There's multiple music publishers.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
And each of these can vary by country.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
There's lots of cases

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
where we have more than one work mashed together.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
So we have to manage many claims

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
to the same video.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
YouTube's Content ID system addresses all of these cases.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
But the system only works through

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
the participation of rights owners.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
If you have content that others are uploading to YouTube,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
you should register in the Content ID system,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and then you'll have the choice

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
about how your content is used.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And think carefully about the policies that you attach to that content.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
By simply blocking all reuse,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
you'll miss out on new art forms,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
new audiences,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
new distribution channels

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and new revenue streams.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
But it's not just about dollars and impressions.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Just look at all the joy

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
that was spread through progressive rights management

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
and new technology.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And I think we can all agree that joy is definitely an idea worth spreading.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Thank you.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
(Applause)
