WEBVTT

00:00:01.198 --> 00:00:04.001
I would be willing to bet
I'm the dumbest guy in the room,

00:00:04.025 --> 00:00:06.987
because I couldn't get through school;
I struggled with school.

00:00:07.011 --> 00:00:10.221
But I knew at a very early age
that I loved money, I loved business

00:00:10.245 --> 00:00:12.132
and I loved this entrepreneurial thing.

00:00:12.156 --> 00:00:13.941
I was raised to be an entrepreneur.

00:00:13.965 --> 00:00:16.418
What I've been really
passionate about ever since --

00:00:16.442 --> 00:00:19.259
and I've never spoken
about this ever, until now --

00:00:19.283 --> 00:00:21.340
so this is the first time
anyone's heard it,

00:00:21.364 --> 00:00:22.862
except my wife, three days ago.

00:00:22.886 --> 00:00:24.784
She said, "What are you talking about?"

00:00:24.808 --> 00:00:27.747
I told her that I think
we miss an opportunity

00:00:27.771 --> 00:00:30.976
to find these kids
who have the entrepreneurial traits,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.976
and to groom them or show them

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.678
that being an entrepreneur
is actually a cool thing.

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:39.035
It's not something
that is a bad thing and is vilified,

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.483
which is what happens in a lot of society.

00:00:41.507 --> 00:00:44.642
Kids, when we grow up, have dreams,

00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:46.672
and we have passions, and we have visions,

00:00:46.696 --> 00:00:48.629
and somehow we get those things crushed.

00:00:48.653 --> 00:00:50.668
We get told that we need to study harder

00:00:50.692 --> 00:00:52.960
or be more focused or get a tutor.

00:00:53.353 --> 00:00:56.912
My parents got me a tutor in French,
and I still suck in French.

00:00:58.472 --> 00:00:59.625
Two years ago,

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.243
I was the highest-rated lecturer
at MIT's Entrepreneurial Master's Program.

00:01:03.267 --> 00:01:06.070
It was a speaking event
in front of groups of entrepreneurs

00:01:06.094 --> 00:01:07.251
from around the world.

00:01:07.275 --> 00:01:10.238
When I was in grade two,
I won a citywide speaking competition,

00:01:10.262 --> 00:01:13.016
but nobody had ever said,
"Hey, this kid's a good speaker.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.558
He can't focus, but he loves walking
around and getting people energized."

00:01:16.582 --> 00:01:18.602
No one said, "Get him
a coach in speaking."

00:01:18.626 --> 00:01:20.733
They said, get me a tutor
in what I suck at.

00:01:20.757 --> 00:01:24.506
So as kids show these traits --
and we need to start looking for them --

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.384
I think we should be raising kids
to be entrepreneurs instead of lawyers.

00:01:28.949 --> 00:01:32.467
Unfortunately, the school system
is grooming this world to say,

00:01:32.491 --> 00:01:34.615
"Let's be a lawyer,"
or, "Let's be a doctor."

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:36.117
We're missing that opportunity,

00:01:36.141 --> 00:01:38.574
because no one ever says,
"Hey, be an entrepreneur."

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:41.649
Entrepreneurs are people --
we have a lot of them in this room --

00:01:41.673 --> 00:01:44.490
who have ideas and passions
or see these needs in the world

00:01:44.514 --> 00:01:46.164
and decide to stand up and do it.

00:01:46.188 --> 00:01:49.038
And we put everything on the line
to make that stuff happen.

00:01:49.062 --> 00:01:51.791
We have the ability
to get the groups of people around us

00:01:51.815 --> 00:01:53.688
that want to build that dream with us.

00:01:53.712 --> 00:01:57.395
And I think if we could get kids
to embrace the idea at a young age,

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:58.633
of being entrepreneurial,

00:01:58.657 --> 00:02:01.644
we could change everything
in the world that's a problem today.

00:02:01.668 --> 00:02:04.074
Every problem out there,
somebody has the idea for.

00:02:04.098 --> 00:02:06.705
And as a young kid,
nobody can say it can't happen,

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.981
because you're too dumb to realize
that you couldn't figure it out.

00:02:10.521 --> 00:02:13.081
I think we have an obligation
as parents and a society

00:02:13.105 --> 00:02:17.271
to start teaching our kids to fish
instead of giving them the fish --

00:02:17.295 --> 00:02:20.160
the old parable: "Give a man
a fish, you feed him for a day.

00:02:20.184 --> 00:02:22.534
Teach a man to fish,
you feed him for a lifetime."

00:02:22.558 --> 00:02:24.766
If we can teach our kids
to be entrepreneurial,

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.520
the ones that show the traits to be,

00:02:26.544 --> 00:02:29.671
like we teach the ones who have
science gifts to go on in science,

00:02:29.695 --> 00:02:32.108
what if we saw the ones
with entrepreneurial traits

00:02:32.132 --> 00:02:33.868
and taught them to be entrepreneurs?

00:02:33.892 --> 00:02:35.996
We could have these kids
spreading businesses

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.049
instead of waiting
for government handouts.

00:02:38.073 --> 00:02:40.803
What we do is teach our kids
the things they shouldn't do:

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:42.615
don't hit; don't bite; don't swear.

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:45.673
Right now we teach our kids
to go after really good jobs;

00:02:45.697 --> 00:02:48.277
the school system teaches them
to go after things like

00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:51.682
being a doctor and being a lawyer
and being an accountant and a dentist

00:02:51.706 --> 00:02:52.960
and a teacher and a pilot.

00:02:52.984 --> 00:02:55.644
And the media says it's really cool
if we could go out

00:02:55.668 --> 00:02:57.167
and be a model or a singer

00:02:57.191 --> 00:03:00.126
or a sports hero like Luongo or Crosby.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.726
Our MBA programs do not teach kids
to be entrepreneurs.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.312
The reason I avoided an MBA program,
other than that I didn't get into any,

00:03:07.336 --> 00:03:09.799
since I had a 61 percent
average out of high school,

00:03:09.823 --> 00:03:11.018
then a 61 percent average

00:03:11.042 --> 00:03:13.717
at the only school in Canada
that accepted me, Carlton,

00:03:13.741 --> 00:03:16.707
is that our MBA programs don't teach
kids to be entrepreneurs.

00:03:16.731 --> 00:03:18.658
They teach them to work in corporations.

00:03:18.682 --> 00:03:21.785
So who's starting these companies?
It's these random few people.

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:24.812
Even in popular literature,
the only book I've ever found --

00:03:24.836 --> 00:03:27.035
and this should be
on all your reading lists --

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:28.449
the only book I've ever found

00:03:28.473 --> 00:03:31.053
that makes the entrepreneur
a hero is "Atlas Shrugged."

00:03:31.077 --> 00:03:33.491
Everything else in the world
looks at entrepreneurs

00:03:33.515 --> 00:03:34.786
and says we're bad people.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.018
I look at even my family.

00:03:36.042 --> 00:03:38.493
Both my grandfathers and my dad
were entrepreneurs.

00:03:38.517 --> 00:03:41.540
My brother, sister and I,
all three of us own companies as well.

00:03:41.564 --> 00:03:45.131
We all decided to start these things
because it's the only place we fit.

00:03:45.155 --> 00:03:48.227
We didn't fit in normal work;
we couldn't work for somebody else,

00:03:48.251 --> 00:03:50.591
we're stubborn and we have
all these other traits.

00:03:50.615 --> 00:03:52.528
But kids could be entrepreneurs as well.

00:03:52.552 --> 00:03:54.465
I'm a big part of a couple organizations

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.161
called the Entrepreneurs' Organization
and the Young Presidents' Organization.

00:03:58.185 --> 00:04:01.630
I just came back from speaking
in Barcelona at the YPO global conference.

00:04:01.654 --> 00:04:04.976
And everyone I met over there
who's an entrepreneur

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.516
struggled with school.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.119
I have 18 out of the 19 signs
of attention deficit disorder diagnosed.

00:04:10.143 --> 00:04:12.952
So this thing right here
is freaking me out.

00:04:12.976 --> 00:04:15.380
(Laughter)

00:04:15.404 --> 00:04:17.203
It's probably why I'm a bit panicked,

00:04:17.227 --> 00:04:19.631
other than all the caffeine
I've had and the sugar.

00:04:19.655 --> 00:04:21.976
But this is really creepy
for an entrepreneur.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.143
Attention deficit disorder,
bipolar disorder.

00:04:24.167 --> 00:04:27.167
Do you know that bipolar disorder
is nicknamed the CEO disease?

00:04:27.191 --> 00:04:29.865
Ted Turner's got it. Steve Jobs has it.

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:33.281
All three of the founders
of Netscape had it.

00:04:33.305 --> 00:04:34.688
I could go on and on.

00:04:34.712 --> 00:04:36.976
Kids -- you can see these signs in kids.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.128
And we're giving them Ritalin and saying,

00:04:39.152 --> 00:04:41.245
"Don't be an entrepreneurial type.

00:04:41.269 --> 00:04:43.919
Fit into this other system
and try to become a student."

00:04:43.943 --> 00:04:45.715
Sorry, entrepreneurs aren't students.

00:04:45.739 --> 00:04:47.572
We fast-track. We figure out the game.

00:04:47.596 --> 00:04:49.644
I stole essays. I cheated on exams.

00:04:49.668 --> 00:04:52.445
I hired kids to do my accounting
assignments in university

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:53.976
for 13 consecutive assignments.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.355
But as an entrepreneur, you don't do
accounting, you hire accountants.

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:59.286
So I just figured that out earlier.

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.976
(Laughter)

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.785
(Applause)

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:05.999
At least I can admit I cheated
in university; most of you won't.

00:05:06.023 --> 00:05:09.357
I'm also quoted -- and I told
the person who wrote the textbook --

00:05:09.381 --> 00:05:11.913
I'm now quoted in that exact same
university textbook

00:05:11.937 --> 00:05:14.743
in every Canadian university
and college studies --

00:05:14.767 --> 00:05:16.976
in managerial accounting,
I'm chapter eight.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.286
I open up chapter eight,
talking about budgeting.

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.505
I told the author,
after they did my interview,

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:23.227
that I cheated in that same course.

00:05:23.251 --> 00:05:25.642
She thought it was too funny
to not include it.

00:05:25.666 --> 00:05:28.015
But kids, you can see these signs in them.

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:31.338
The definition of entrepreneur
is "a person who organizes, operates

00:05:31.362 --> 00:05:33.576
and assumes the risk
of a business venture."

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.006
That doesn't mean you have
to go to an MBA program,

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:37.900
or that you have to get through school.

00:05:37.924 --> 00:05:41.095
It just means that those few things
have to feel right in your gut.

00:05:41.119 --> 00:05:43.585
We've heard, "Is it nurture
or is it nature?" Right?

00:05:43.609 --> 00:05:45.587
Is it thing one or thing two? What is it?

00:05:45.611 --> 00:05:48.240
Well, I don't think it's either.
I think it can be both.

00:05:48.264 --> 00:05:49.867
I was groomed as an entrepreneur.

00:05:49.891 --> 00:05:52.651
When I was growing up
as a young kid, I had no choice,

00:05:52.675 --> 00:05:54.651
because I was taught at a very early age,

00:05:54.675 --> 00:05:57.285
when my dad realized I didn't fit
into everything else

00:05:57.309 --> 00:05:59.144
that was being taught to me in school,

00:05:59.168 --> 00:06:02.119
that he could teach me
to figure out business at an early age.

00:06:02.143 --> 00:06:05.391
He groomed us, the three of us,
to hate the thought of having a job

00:06:05.415 --> 00:06:07.424
and to love the fact of creating companies

00:06:07.448 --> 00:06:09.123
where we could employ other people.

00:06:09.147 --> 00:06:12.081
My first business venture:
I was seven years old, in Winnipeg.

00:06:12.105 --> 00:06:14.878
I was in my bedroom
with one of those long extension cords,

00:06:14.902 --> 00:06:16.829
calling all the dry cleaners in Winnipeg

00:06:16.853 --> 00:06:19.285
to find out how much they'd pay
me for coat hangers.

00:06:19.309 --> 00:06:21.286
And my mom came into the room and said,

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.610
"Where are you going to get the hangers
to sell to the dry cleaners?"

00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:26.733
And I said, "Let's go look
in the basement."

00:06:26.757 --> 00:06:29.583
We went down to the basement,
and I opened up this cupboard.

00:06:29.607 --> 00:06:31.925
There was about 1,000 hangers
that I'd collected,

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:34.251
because, when I told her
I was going out to play,

00:06:34.275 --> 00:06:36.331
I was going door to door
in the neighborhood

00:06:36.355 --> 00:06:38.417
to collect hangers to put in the basement,

00:06:38.441 --> 00:06:41.037
because I saw her
a few weeks before that --

00:06:41.061 --> 00:06:44.039
you could get paid, they used to pay
two cents per coat hanger.

00:06:44.063 --> 00:06:46.425
So I was like, well,
there's all kinds of hangers,

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:47.651
so I'll just go get them.

00:06:47.675 --> 00:06:49.587
I knew she wouldn't want me to get them,

00:06:49.611 --> 00:06:50.816
so I just did it anyway.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.651
And I learned that you could
actually negotiate with people.

00:06:53.675 --> 00:06:57.147
This one guy offered me three cents
and I got him up to three and a half.

00:06:57.171 --> 00:06:58.617
I even knew at seven years old

00:06:58.641 --> 00:07:00.895
that I could get
a fractional percent of a cent,

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:03.266
and people would pay it,
because it multiplied up.

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:05.021
At seven years old I figured it out.

00:07:05.045 --> 00:07:07.254
I got three and a half cents
for 1,000 hangers.

00:07:07.278 --> 00:07:09.390
I sold license plate
protectors door to door.

00:07:09.414 --> 00:07:11.301
My dad actually made me go find someone

00:07:11.325 --> 00:07:13.085
who would sell me them at wholesale.

00:07:13.109 --> 00:07:15.798
At nine years old, I walked
around in the city of Sudbury

00:07:15.822 --> 00:07:17.980
selling license-plate
protectors door to door.

00:07:18.004 --> 00:07:20.184
And I remember
this one customer so vividly --

00:07:20.208 --> 00:07:23.759
I also did some other stuff
with these clients, I sold newspapers,

00:07:23.783 --> 00:07:25.935
and he wouldn't buy
a newspaper from me, ever.

00:07:25.959 --> 00:07:29.539
But I was convinced I was going to get him
to buy a license-plate protector.

00:07:29.563 --> 00:07:31.240
And he's like, "We don't need one."

00:07:31.264 --> 00:07:32.912
I said, "But you've got two cars."

00:07:32.936 --> 00:07:34.342
Remember, I'm nine years old.

00:07:34.366 --> 00:07:37.874
I'm like, "You have two cars and they
don't have license-plate protectors.

00:07:37.898 --> 00:07:40.712
And this car has one license plate
that's all crumpled up."

00:07:40.736 --> 00:07:42.290
He said, "That's my wife's car."

00:07:42.314 --> 00:07:45.651
I said, "Why don't we test one on her car
and see if it lasts longer?"

00:07:45.675 --> 00:07:48.651
So I knew there were two cars
with two license plates on each.

00:07:48.675 --> 00:07:51.269
If I couldn't sell all four,
I could at least get one.

00:07:51.293 --> 00:07:52.741
I learned that at a young age.

00:07:52.765 --> 00:07:54.059
I did comic book arbitrage.

00:07:54.083 --> 00:07:56.403
When I was about 10 years old,
I sold comic books

00:07:56.427 --> 00:07:58.167
out of our cottage on Georgian Bay.

00:07:58.191 --> 00:08:00.296
I would go biking
up to the end of the beach,

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.194
buy all the comics from the poor kids,

00:08:02.218 --> 00:08:05.651
then go back to the other end of the beach
to sell them to the rich kids.

00:08:05.675 --> 00:08:07.651
It was obvious to me: buy low, sell high.

00:08:07.675 --> 00:08:09.923
You've got this demand
over here that has money.

00:08:09.947 --> 00:08:12.693
Don't try to sell to the poor kids;
they don't have cash.

00:08:12.717 --> 00:08:14.560
The rich people do. Obvious, right?

00:08:14.584 --> 00:08:15.747
It's like a recession.

00:08:15.771 --> 00:08:16.938
So there's a recession.

00:08:16.962 --> 00:08:19.978
There's still 13 trillion dollars
circulating in the US economy.

00:08:20.002 --> 00:08:22.590
Go get some of that.
I learned that at a young age.

00:08:22.614 --> 00:08:24.604
I also learned, don't reveal your source:

00:08:24.628 --> 00:08:26.511
I got beat up after four weeks of this,

00:08:26.535 --> 00:08:29.842
because one of the rich kids found out
where I was buying my comics,

00:08:29.866 --> 00:08:31.787
and didn't like that he was paying more.

00:08:31.811 --> 00:08:34.174
I was forced to get
a paper route at 10 years old.

00:08:34.198 --> 00:08:37.718
I didn't want a paper route, but my dad
said, "That's your next business."

00:08:37.742 --> 00:08:40.066
Not only did he get me one,
but I had to get two.

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:42.781
He wanted me to hire someone
to deliver half the papers,

00:08:42.805 --> 00:08:43.956
which I did.

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.988
Then I realized: collecting tips
is how you made all the money.

00:08:47.012 --> 00:08:48.740
So I'd collect tips and get payment.

00:08:48.764 --> 00:08:51.651
I would collect for the papers --
he could just deliver them.

00:08:51.675 --> 00:08:53.690
Because then I realized
I could make money.

00:08:53.714 --> 00:08:56.548
By this point, I was definitely
not going to be an employee.

00:08:56.572 --> 00:08:57.944
(Laughter)

00:08:57.968 --> 00:09:00.500
My dad owned an automotive
and industrial repair shop.

00:09:00.524 --> 00:09:02.940
He had all these old
automotive parts lying around.

00:09:02.964 --> 00:09:04.639
They had this old brass and copper.

00:09:04.663 --> 00:09:07.640
I asked what he did with it,
and he said he just throws it out.

00:09:07.664 --> 00:09:10.650
I said, "Wouldn't somebody pay
for that?" And he goes, "Maybe."

00:09:10.674 --> 00:09:12.603
Remember: at 10 years old, 34 years ago,

00:09:12.627 --> 00:09:15.726
I saw opportunity in this stuff,
I saw there was money in garbage.

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:19.102
And I collected it from the automotive
shops in the area on my bicycle.

00:09:19.126 --> 00:09:22.211
Then my dad would drive me on Saturdays
to a scrap metal recycler

00:09:22.235 --> 00:09:23.390
where I got paid.

00:09:23.414 --> 00:09:25.134
And I thought that was kind of cool.

00:09:25.158 --> 00:09:28.207
Strangely enough, 30 years later,
we're building 1-800-GOT-JUNK?

00:09:28.231 --> 00:09:29.719
and making money off that, too.

00:09:29.743 --> 00:09:32.797
I built these little pincushions
when I was 11 years old in Cubs.

00:09:32.821 --> 00:09:35.417
We made these pincushions
for our moms for Mother's Day

00:09:35.441 --> 00:09:37.097
out of wooden clothespins --

00:09:37.121 --> 00:09:39.615
when we used to hang clothes
on clotheslines outside.

00:09:39.639 --> 00:09:41.005
And you'd make these chairs.

00:09:41.029 --> 00:09:43.427
And I had these little pillows
that I would sew up.

00:09:43.451 --> 00:09:45.049
And you could stuff pins in them.

00:09:45.073 --> 00:09:47.952
Because people used to sew
and they needed a pincushion.

00:09:49.057 --> 00:09:51.154
But I realized you had to have options,

00:09:51.178 --> 00:09:53.398
so I spray-painted
a whole bunch of them brown,

00:09:53.422 --> 00:09:56.426
so when I went to the door,
it wasn't, "Do you want to buy one?"

00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:58.226
It was, "Which color would you like?"

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:00.358
I'm 10 years old;
you're not going to say no,

00:10:00.382 --> 00:10:03.563
especially if you have two options,
the brown one or the clear one.

00:10:03.587 --> 00:10:05.512
So I learned that lesson at a young age.

00:10:05.536 --> 00:10:07.894
I learned that manual labor really sucks.

00:10:07.918 --> 00:10:10.199
Right, like cutting lawns is brutal.

00:10:10.931 --> 00:10:14.045
But because I had to cut lawns
all summer for all of our neighbors

00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:15.252
and get paid to do that,

00:10:15.276 --> 00:10:18.746
I realized that recurring revenue
from one client is amazing,

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:21.166
that if I land this client once,

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:23.313
and every week I get paid by that person,

00:10:23.337 --> 00:10:27.651
that's way better than trying to sell
one clothespin thing to one person,

00:10:27.675 --> 00:10:29.296
because you can't sell them more.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.789
So I love that recurring revenue model
I started to learn at a young age.

00:10:32.813 --> 00:10:36.273
Remember, I was being groomed to do this.
I was not allowed to have jobs.

00:10:36.297 --> 00:10:38.715
I would go to the golf course
and caddy for people,

00:10:38.739 --> 00:10:42.229
but I realized there was this one hill
on our golf course, the 13th hole,

00:10:42.253 --> 00:10:43.427
that had this huge hill,

00:10:43.451 --> 00:10:45.524
and people could never
get their bags up it.

00:10:45.548 --> 00:10:48.437
So I'd sit there in a lawn chair
and carry for all the people

00:10:48.461 --> 00:10:49.637
who didn't have caddies.

00:10:49.661 --> 00:10:52.532
I'd carry their golf bags to the top;
they'd pay me a dollar,

00:10:52.556 --> 00:10:55.517
while my friends worked for hours
hauling some guy's bag around

00:10:55.541 --> 00:10:56.699
for 10 bucks.

00:10:56.723 --> 00:10:59.444
I'm like, "That's stupid.
You have to work for five hours.

00:10:59.468 --> 00:11:02.669
That doesn't make sense. Figure out
a way to make more money faster.

00:11:02.693 --> 00:11:05.604
Every week, I'd go to the corner store
and buy all these pops,

00:11:05.628 --> 00:11:08.651
Then I'd deliver them
to these 70-year-old women playing bridge.

00:11:08.675 --> 00:11:11.119
They'd give me their orders
for the following week.

00:11:11.143 --> 00:11:12.777
I'd deliver pop and charge twice.

00:11:12.801 --> 00:11:14.110
I had this captured market.

00:11:14.134 --> 00:11:17.794
You didn't need contracts, you just needed
to have a supply and demand

00:11:17.818 --> 00:11:19.651
and this audience who bought into you.

00:11:19.675 --> 00:11:21.871
These women weren't going
to go to anybody else

00:11:21.895 --> 00:11:24.373
because they liked me,
and I kind of figured it out.

00:11:24.397 --> 00:11:26.515
I went and got golf balls
from golf courses.

00:11:26.539 --> 00:11:28.651
But everybody else was looking in the bush

00:11:28.675 --> 00:11:30.727
and looking in the ditches for golf balls.

00:11:30.751 --> 00:11:34.458
I'm like, screw that. They're in the pond.
And nobody's going into the pond.

00:11:34.482 --> 00:11:37.870
So I'd go into the ponds and crawl
around and pick them up with my toes,

00:11:37.894 --> 00:11:39.487
just pick them up with both feet.

00:11:39.511 --> 00:11:41.321
You can't do it onstage.

00:11:41.345 --> 00:11:44.274
You get the golf balls,
throw them in your bathing suit trunks

00:11:44.298 --> 00:11:47.037
and when you're done, you've got
a couple hundred of them.

00:11:47.061 --> 00:11:49.818
But the problem is, people
didn't want all the golf balls.

00:11:49.842 --> 00:11:51.938
So I just packaged them.
I'm like 12, right?

00:11:51.962 --> 00:11:53.399
I packaged them up three ways.

00:11:53.423 --> 00:11:55.822
I had the Pinnacles, DDHs
and the really cool ones.

00:11:55.846 --> 00:11:57.377
Those sold for two dollars each.

00:11:57.401 --> 00:12:00.447
Then I had the good ones
that didn't look crappy: 50 cents each.

00:12:00.471 --> 00:12:03.049
And then I'd sell 50 at a time
of all the crappy ones.

00:12:03.073 --> 00:12:05.325
And they could use those
for practice balls.

00:12:05.349 --> 00:12:07.435
I sold sunglasses when I was in school,

00:12:08.227 --> 00:12:09.824
to all the kids in high school.

00:12:09.848 --> 00:12:12.435
This is what really kind of gets
everybody hating you,

00:12:12.459 --> 00:12:15.957
because you're trying to extract money
from all your friends all the time.

00:12:15.981 --> 00:12:17.163
But it paid the bills.

00:12:17.187 --> 00:12:19.056
So I sold lots and lots of sunglasses.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.834
Then when the school shut me down --

00:12:20.858 --> 00:12:23.787
they called me into the office
and told me I couldn't do it --

00:12:23.811 --> 00:12:27.362
I went to the gas stations and sold
lots of them to the gas stations

00:12:27.386 --> 00:12:29.933
and had the gas stations
sell them to their customers.

00:12:29.957 --> 00:12:32.321
That was cool because then,
I had retail outlets.

00:12:32.345 --> 00:12:33.496
I think I was 14.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.776
Then I paid my entire way through
first year of university at Carlton

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.432
by selling wineskins door to door.

00:12:38.456 --> 00:12:40.616
You know you can hold
a 40-ounce bottle of rum

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.473
and two bottles of coke in a wineskin?

00:12:42.497 --> 00:12:44.131
So what, right? But you know what?

00:12:44.155 --> 00:12:46.921
Stuff that down your shorts
when you go to a football game,

00:12:46.945 --> 00:12:48.383
you can get booze in for free.

00:12:48.407 --> 00:12:49.607
Everybody bought them.

00:12:49.631 --> 00:12:51.927
Supply, demand, big opportunity.

00:12:51.951 --> 00:12:55.052
I also branded it, so I sold them
for five times the normal cost.

00:12:55.076 --> 00:12:56.651
It had our university logo on it.

00:12:56.675 --> 00:12:59.044
You know, we teach our kids
and we buy them games,

00:12:59.068 --> 00:13:02.165
but why don't we get them games,
if they're entrepreneurial kids,

00:13:02.189 --> 00:13:04.676
that nurture the traits
you need to be entrepreneurs?

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.990
Why don't you teach them
not to waste money?

00:13:07.014 --> 00:13:09.926
I remember being told to walk
out into the middle of a street

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:11.120
in Banff, Alberta.

00:13:11.144 --> 00:13:12.954
I'd thrown a penny out in the street,

00:13:12.978 --> 00:13:14.511
and my dad said, "Go pick it up.

00:13:14.535 --> 00:13:18.147
I work too damn hard for my money.
I'm not going to see you waste a penny."

00:13:18.171 --> 00:13:19.855
I remember that lesson to this day.

00:13:19.879 --> 00:13:21.773
Allowances teach kids the wrong habits.

00:13:21.797 --> 00:13:25.368
Allowances, by nature,
are teaching kids to think about a job.

00:13:25.392 --> 00:13:28.369
An entrepreneur doesn't expect
a regular paycheck.

00:13:28.393 --> 00:13:32.074
Allowance is breeding kids at a young age
to expect a regular paycheck.

00:13:32.098 --> 00:13:34.787
That's wrong, for me,
if you want to raise entrepreneurs.

00:13:34.811 --> 00:13:36.798
What I do with my kids, nine and seven,

00:13:36.822 --> 00:13:39.292
is teach them to walk
around the house and the yard,

00:13:39.316 --> 00:13:41.293
looking for stuff that needs to get done.

00:13:41.317 --> 00:13:42.704
Come and tell me what it is.

00:13:42.728 --> 00:13:44.651
Or I'll say, "Here's what I need done."

00:13:44.675 --> 00:13:46.773
And then, you know
what we do? We negotiate.

00:13:46.797 --> 00:13:48.651
They go around looking for what it is,

00:13:48.675 --> 00:13:50.651
then we negotiate what they'll get paid.

00:13:50.675 --> 00:13:52.301
They don't have a regular check,

00:13:52.325 --> 00:13:54.563
but they have opportunities
to find more stuff,

00:13:54.587 --> 00:13:57.651
and learn the skill of negotiating
and of finding opportunities.

00:13:57.675 --> 00:13:59.081
You breed that kind of stuff.

00:13:59.105 --> 00:14:00.874
Each of my kids has two piggy banks.

00:14:00.898 --> 00:14:04.353
Fifty percent of all the money they earn
goes in their house account,

00:14:04.377 --> 00:14:06.155
50 percent goes in their toy account.

00:14:06.179 --> 00:14:08.550
The toy account,
they spend on whatever they want.

00:14:08.574 --> 00:14:12.082
The 50 percent in their house account,
every six months, goes to the bank.

00:14:12.106 --> 00:14:13.257
they walk up with me.

00:14:13.281 --> 00:14:16.079
Every year, all the money
in the bank goes to their broker.

00:14:16.103 --> 00:14:19.071
Both my nine- and seven-year-olds
have a stockbroker already.

00:14:19.095 --> 00:14:21.295
I'm teaching them
to force that savings habit.

00:14:21.319 --> 00:14:23.606
It drives me crazy
that 30-year-olds are saying,

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:25.822
"Maybe I'll start contributing
to my RSP now."

00:14:25.846 --> 00:14:27.577
Shit, you've missed 25 years.

00:14:27.601 --> 00:14:29.566
You can teach those habits to young kids,

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:31.464
when they don't even feel the pain yet.

00:14:31.488 --> 00:14:35.650
Don't read bedtime stories every night --
maybe four nights of the week,

00:14:35.674 --> 00:14:37.953
and three nights, have them tell stories.

00:14:37.977 --> 00:14:40.737
Why don't you sit down with kids
and give them four items,

00:14:40.761 --> 00:14:43.651
a red shirt, a blue tie,
a kangaroo and a laptop,

00:14:43.675 --> 00:14:46.104
and have them tell a story
about those four things?

00:14:46.128 --> 00:14:47.526
My kids do that all the time.

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:49.867
It teaches them to sell,
teaches them creativity,

00:14:49.891 --> 00:14:51.706
teaches them to think on their feet.

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:53.651
Do that kind of stuff, have fun with it.

00:14:53.675 --> 00:14:55.993
Get kids to stand up
in front of groups and talk,

00:14:56.017 --> 00:14:58.092
even if it's just
in front of their friends,

00:14:58.116 --> 00:14:59.598
and do plays and have speeches.

00:14:59.622 --> 00:15:02.367
Those are entrepreneurial traits
you want to be nurturing.

00:15:02.391 --> 00:15:05.039
Show kids what bad customers
or bad employees look like.

00:15:05.063 --> 00:15:06.397
Show them grumpy employees.

00:15:06.421 --> 00:15:08.901
When you see grumpy
customer service, point it out.

00:15:08.925 --> 00:15:11.247
Say, "By the way,
that guy is a crappy employee."

00:15:11.271 --> 00:15:12.831
And say, "These are good ones."

00:15:12.855 --> 00:15:14.888
(Laughter)

00:15:14.912 --> 00:15:17.646
If you go into a restaurant
and have bad customer service,

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:19.910
show them what bad
customer service looks like.

00:15:19.934 --> 00:15:21.826
(Laughter)

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:23.826
We have all these lessons in front of us,

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:27.086
but we don't take those opportunities;
we teach kids to get a tutor.

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:30.484
Imagine if you actually took
all the kids' junk in the house right now,

00:15:30.508 --> 00:15:32.390
all the toys they outgrew two years ago

00:15:32.414 --> 00:15:35.635
and said, "Why don't we sell
some of this on Craigslist and Kijiji?"

00:15:35.659 --> 00:15:39.350
And they actually sell it and learn
how to find scammers when offers come in.

00:15:39.374 --> 00:15:42.258
They can come into your account
or a sub account or whatever.

00:15:42.282 --> 00:15:44.767
But teach them how to fix
the price, guess the price,

00:15:44.791 --> 00:15:46.651
pull up the photos.

00:15:46.675 --> 00:15:49.331
Teach them how to do
that kind of stuff and make money.

00:15:49.355 --> 00:15:51.420
Then 50 percent
goes in their house account,

00:15:51.444 --> 00:15:53.002
50 percent in their toy account.

00:15:53.026 --> 00:15:54.234
My kids love this stuff.

00:15:54.258 --> 00:15:57.324
Some of the entrepreneurial traits
you've got to nurture in kids:

00:15:57.348 --> 00:16:00.794
attainment, tenacity, leadership,
introspection, interdependence, values.

00:16:00.818 --> 00:16:04.415
All these traits, you can find in young
kids, and you can help nurture them.

00:16:04.439 --> 00:16:05.779
Look for that kind of stuff.

00:16:05.803 --> 00:16:08.193
There's two traits I want you
to also look out for

00:16:08.217 --> 00:16:10.408
that we don't get out of their system.

00:16:10.432 --> 00:16:12.814
Don't medicate kids
for attention deficit disorder

00:16:12.838 --> 00:16:14.815
unless it is really, really freaking bad.

00:16:14.839 --> 00:16:16.411
(Applause)

00:16:16.435 --> 00:16:19.553
The same with the whole things
on mania and stress and depression,

00:16:19.577 --> 00:16:21.554
unless it is so clinically brutal, man.

00:16:21.578 --> 00:16:24.037
Bipolar disorder is nicknamed
"the CEO disease."

00:16:24.061 --> 00:16:28.611
When Steve Jurvetson, Jim Clark
and Jim Barksdale have all got it,

00:16:28.635 --> 00:16:30.051
and they built Netscape --

00:16:30.075 --> 00:16:31.785
imagine if they were given Ritalin.

00:16:31.809 --> 00:16:33.651
We wouldn't have that stuff, right?

00:16:33.675 --> 00:16:36.428
Al Gore really would have had
to invented the Internet.

00:16:36.452 --> 00:16:38.190
(Laughter)

00:16:38.214 --> 00:16:41.129
These are the skills
we should be teaching in the classroom,

00:16:41.153 --> 00:16:42.448
as well as everything else.

00:16:42.472 --> 00:16:44.968
I'm not saying don't get kids
to want to be lawyers.

00:16:44.992 --> 00:16:48.145
But how about getting entrepreneurship
to be ranked right up there

00:16:48.169 --> 00:16:49.321
with the rest of them?

00:16:49.345 --> 00:16:51.375
Because there's huge
opportunities in that.

00:16:51.399 --> 00:16:53.106
I want to close with a quick video

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:55.361
that was done by one
of the companies I mentor.

00:16:55.385 --> 00:16:56.879
These guys, Grasshopper.

00:16:56.903 --> 00:16:58.068
It's about kids.

00:16:58.092 --> 00:16:59.458
It's about entrepreneurship.

00:16:59.482 --> 00:17:02.407
Hopefully, this inspires you
to take what you've heard from me

00:17:02.431 --> 00:17:04.592
and do something with it
to change the world.

00:17:04.904 --> 00:17:07.198
[Kid... "And you thought
you could do anything?"]

00:17:07.222 --> 00:17:09.199
[You still can.]

00:17:09.223 --> 00:17:12.056
[Because a lot of what
we consider impossible]

00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:14.651
[is easy to overcome]

00:17:14.675 --> 00:17:17.675
[Because in case you haven't
noticed, we live in a place where]

00:17:17.699 --> 00:17:20.437
[one individual can make a difference]

00:17:20.461 --> 00:17:21.660
[Want proof?]

00:17:21.684 --> 00:17:23.971
[Just look at the people
who built our country:]

00:17:23.995 --> 00:17:26.188
[Our parents, grandparents,
our aunts, uncles]

00:17:26.212 --> 00:17:28.982
[They were immigrants, newcomers
ready to make their mark]

00:17:29.006 --> 00:17:31.651
[Maybe they came with very little]

00:17:31.675 --> 00:17:33.935
[or perhaps they didn't own
anything except for]

00:17:33.959 --> 00:17:36.825
[a single brilliant idea]

00:17:36.849 --> 00:17:39.097
[These people were thinkers, doers]

00:17:40.508 --> 00:17:41.984
[innovators]

00:17:42.389 --> 00:17:44.338
[until they came up with the name]

00:17:46.149 --> 00:17:49.140
[entrepreneurs]

00:17:49.164 --> 00:17:51.718
[They change the way we think
about what is possible.]

00:17:51.742 --> 00:17:54.289
[They have a clear vision
of how life can be better]

00:17:54.313 --> 00:17:56.508
[for all of us, even when
times are tough.]

00:17:56.532 --> 00:17:57.964
[Right now, it's hard to see]

00:17:57.988 --> 00:18:00.719
[when our view is cluttered
with obstacles.]

00:18:00.743 --> 00:18:04.989
[But turbulence creates opportunities]

00:18:05.013 --> 00:18:08.290
[for success, achievement, and pushes us]

00:18:08.659 --> 00:18:10.555
[to discover new ways of doing things]

00:18:10.966 --> 00:18:13.703
[So what opportunities
will you go after and why?]

00:18:13.727 --> 00:18:16.150
[If you're an entrepreneur]

00:18:16.174 --> 00:18:19.056
[you know that risk isn't the reward.]

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.176
[No. The rewards are driving innovation]

00:18:21.948 --> 00:18:23.965
[changing people's lives. Creating jobs.]

00:18:24.349 --> 00:18:26.507
[Fueling growth.]

00:18:26.531 --> 00:18:29.651
[And making a better world.]

00:18:29.675 --> 00:18:31.180
[Entrepreneurs are everywhere.]

00:18:31.204 --> 00:18:33.737
[They run small businesses
that support our economy,]

00:18:33.761 --> 00:18:35.003
[design tools to help you]

00:18:35.027 --> 00:18:37.465
[stay connected with friends,
family and colleagues]

00:18:37.489 --> 00:18:41.125
[And they're finding new ways of helping
to solve society's oldest problems.]

00:18:41.149 --> 00:18:42.584
[Do you know an entrepreneur?]

00:18:42.608 --> 00:18:44.659
[Entrepreneurs can be anyone
Even... you]

00:18:44.683 --> 00:18:47.732
[So seize the opportunity to create
the job you always wanted]

00:18:47.756 --> 00:18:49.320
[Help heal the economy]

00:18:49.344 --> 00:18:50.496
[Make a difference.]

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.240
[Take your business to new heights,]

00:18:53.603 --> 00:18:54.872
[but most importantly,]

00:18:54.896 --> 00:18:57.476
[remember when you were a kid]

00:18:58.516 --> 00:19:01.524
[when everything was within your reach,]

00:19:01.548 --> 00:19:05.548
[and then say to yourself
quietly, but with determination:]

00:19:07.595 --> 00:19:09.341
[it still is.]

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:13.802
Thank you very much for having me.

00:19:13.826 --> 00:19:15.706
(Applause)
