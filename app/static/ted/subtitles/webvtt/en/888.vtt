00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:11.000
(Music)

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
[Sanskrit]

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
This is an ode to the mother goddess,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
that most of us in India learn when we are children.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I learned it when I was four

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
at my mother's knee.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
That year she introduced me to dance,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and thus began

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
my tryst with classical dance.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Since then -- it's been four decades now --

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I've trained with the best in the field,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
performed across the globe,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
taught young and old alike,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
created, collaborated,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
choreographed,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and wove a rich tapestry

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
of artistry, achievement and awards.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
The crowning glory was in 2007,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
when I received this country's

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
fourth highest civilian award, the Padma Shri,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
for my contribution to art.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
(Applause)

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
But nothing, nothing prepared me

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
for what I was to hear

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
on the first of July 2008.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I heard the word "carcinoma."

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Yes, breast cancer.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
As I sat dumbstruck in my doctor's office,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I heard other words:

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
"cancer," "stage," "grade."

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Until then, Cancer was the zodiac

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
sign of my friend,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
stage was what I performed on,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
and grades were what I got in school.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
That day, I realized

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I had an unwelcome, uninvited,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
new life partner.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
As a dancer,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I know the nine rasas or the navarasas:

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
anger, valor,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
disgust, humor

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and fear.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I thought I knew what fear was.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
That day, I learned what fear was.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Overcome with the enormity of it all

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and the complete feeling of loss of control,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I shed copious tears

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
and asked my dear husband, Jayant.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
I said, "Is this it? Is this the end of the road?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Is this the end of my dance?"

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And he, the positive soul that he is,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
said, "No, this is just a hiatus,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
a hiatus during the treatment,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
and you'll get back to doing what you do best."

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
I realized then

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
that I, who thought I had complete control of my life,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
had control of only three things:

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
My thought, my mind --

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
the images that these thoughts created --

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and the action that derived from it.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
So here I was wallowing

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
in a vortex of emotions

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and depression and what have you,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
with the enormity of the situation,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
wanting to go to a place of healing, health and happiness.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
I wanted to go from where I was

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
to where I wanted to be,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
for which I needed something.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
I needed something that would pull me out of all this.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
So I dried my tears,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
and I declared to the world at large ...

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
I said, "Cancer's only one page in my life,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
and I will not allow this page to impact the rest of my life."

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
I also declared to the world at large

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
that I would ride it out,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
and I would not allow cancer to ride me.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
But to go from where I was

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
to where I wanted to be,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
I needed something.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
I needed an anchor, an image,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
a peg

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
to peg this process on,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
so that I could go from there.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
And I found that in my dance,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
my dance, my strength, my energy, my passion,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
my very life breath.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
But it wasn't easy.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Believe me, it definitely wasn't easy.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
How do you keep cheer

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
when you go from beautiful

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
to bald in three days?

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
How do you not despair

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
when, with the body ravaged by chemotherapy,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
climbing a mere flight of stairs was sheer torture,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
that to someone like me who could dance for three hours?

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
How do you not get overwhelmed

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
by the despair and the misery of it all?

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
All I wanted to do was curl up and weep.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
But I kept telling myself fear and tears

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
are options I did not have.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
So I would drag myself into my dance studio --

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
body, mind and spirit -- every day into my dance studio,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
and learn everything I learned

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
when I was four, all over again,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
reworked, relearned, regrouped.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
It was excruciatingly painful, but I did it.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Difficult.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
I focused on my mudras,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
on the imagery of my dance,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
on the poetry and the metaphor

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
and the philosophy of the dance itself.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
And slowly, I moved out

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
of that miserable state of mind.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
But I needed something else.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
I needed something to go that extra mile,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
and I found it in that metaphor

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
which I had learned from my mother when I was four.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
The metaphor of Mahishasura Mardhini,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
of Durga.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Durga, the mother goddess, the fearless one,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
created by the pantheon of Hindu gods.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Durga, resplendent, bedecked, beautiful,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
her 18 arms

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
ready for warfare,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
as she rode astride her lion

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
into the battlefield to destroy Mahishasur.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Durga, the epitome

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
of creative feminine energy,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
or shakti.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Durga, the fearless one.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
I made that image of Durga

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
and her every attribute, her every nuance,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
my very own.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Powered by the symbology of a myth

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
and the passion of my training,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
I brought laser-sharp focus into my dance,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
laser-sharp focus to such an extent

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
that I danced a few weeks after surgery.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
I danced through chemo and radiation cycles,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
much to the dismay of my oncologist.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
I danced between chemo and radiation cycles

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
and badgered him to fit it

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
to my performing dance schedule.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
What I had done

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
is I had tuned out of cancer

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
and tuned into my dance.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Yes, cancer has just been one page in my life.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
My story

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
is a story of overcoming setbacks,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
obstacles and challenges

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
that life throws at you.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
My story is the power of thought.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
My story is the power of choice.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
It's the power of focus.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
It's the power of bringing ourselves

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
to the attention of something that so animates you,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
so moves you,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
that something even like cancer becomes insignificant.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
My story is the power of a metaphor.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
It's the power of an image.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Mine was that of Durga,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Durga the fearless one.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
She was also called Simhanandini,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
the one who rode the lion.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
As I ride out,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
as I ride my own inner strength,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
my own inner resilience,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
armed as I am with what medication can provide

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
and continue treatment,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
as I ride out into the battlefield of cancer,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
asking my rogue cells to behave,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
I want to be known not as a cancer survivor,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
but as a cancer conqueror.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
I present to you an excerpt of that work

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
"Simhanandini."

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
(Applause)

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:45.000
(Music)

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:44.000
(Applause)
