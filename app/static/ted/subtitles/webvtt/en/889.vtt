00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm going to talk about the simple truth in leadership

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
in the 21st century.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
In the 21st century, we need to actually look at --

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and what I'm actually going to encourage you to consider today --

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
is to go back to our school days

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
when we learned how to count.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
But I think it's time for us to think about what we count.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Because what we actually count

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
truly counts.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Let me start by telling you a little story.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
This is Van Quach.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
She came to this country in 1986 from Vietnam.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
She changed her name to Vivian

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
because she wanted to fit in here in America.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Her first job was at an inner-city motel

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
in San Francisco as a maid.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I happened to buy that motel

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
about three months after Vivian started working there.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So Vivian and I have been working together for 23 years.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
With the youthful idealism of a 26-year-old,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
in 1987,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I started my company and I called it Joie de Vivre,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
a very impractical name,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
because I actually was looking to create joy of life.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And this first hotel that I bought, motel,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
was a pay-by-the-hour, no-tell motel

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
in the inner-city of San Francisco.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
As I spent time with Vivian,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I saw that she had sort of a joie de vivre

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
in how she did her work.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
It made me question and curious:

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
How could someone actually find joy

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
in cleaning toilets for a living?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So I spent time with Vivian, and I saw that

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
she didn't find joy in cleaning toilets.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Her job, her goal and her calling

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
was not to become the world's greatest toilet scrubber.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
What counts for Vivian was the emotional connection

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
she created with her fellow employees and our guests.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And what gave her inspiration and meaning

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
was the fact that she was taking care of people

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
who were far away from home.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Because Vivian knew what it was like to be far away from home.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
That very human lesson,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
more than 20 years ago,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
served me well during the last

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
economic downturn we had.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
In the wake of the dotcom crash and 9/11,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
San Francisco Bay Area hotels

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
went through the largest percentage revenue drop

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
in the history of American hotels.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
We were the largest operator of hotels in the Bay Area,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
so we were particularly vulnerable.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
But also back then,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
remember we stopped eating French fries in this country.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Well, not exactly, of course not.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
We started eating "freedom fries,"

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and we started boycotting anything that was French.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Well, my name of my company, Joie de Vivre --

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
so I started getting these letters

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
from places like Alabama and Orange County

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
saying to me that they were going to boycott my company

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
because they thought we were a French company.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And I'd write them back, and I'd say, "What a minute. We're not French.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
We're an American company. We're based in San Francisco."

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And I'd get a terse response: "Oh, that's worse."

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
(Laughter)

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
So one particular day

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
when I was feeling a little depressed and not a lot of joie de vivre,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
I ended up in the local bookstore around the corner from our offices.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And I initially ended up in the business section of the bookstore

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
looking for a business solution.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
But given my befuddled state of mind, I ended up

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
in the self-help section very quickly.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
That's where I got reacquainted with

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Abraham Maslow's "hierarchy of needs."

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I took one psychology class in college,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
and I learned about this guy, Abraham Maslow,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
as many of us are familiar with his hierarchy of needs.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
But as I sat there for four hours,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
the full afternoon, reading Maslow,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
I recognized something

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
that is true of most leaders.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
One of the simplest facts in business

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
is something that we often neglect,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
and that is that we're all human.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Each of us, no matter what our role is in business,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
has some hierarchy of needs

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
in the workplace.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
So as I started reading more Maslow,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
what I started to realize is that

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Maslow, later in his life,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
wanted to take this hierarchy for the individual

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
and apply it to the collective,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
to organizations and specifically to business.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
But unfortunately, he died prematurely in 1970,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
and so he wasn't really able to live that dream completely.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
So I realized in that dotcom crash

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
that my role in life was to channel Abe Maslow.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
And that's what I did a few years ago

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
when I took that five-level hierarchy of needs pyramid

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
and turned it into what I call the transformation pyramid,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
which is survival, success and transformation.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
It's not just fundamental in business, it's fundamental in life.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
And we started asking ourselves the questions

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
about how we were actually addressing

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
the higher needs, these transformational needs

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
for our key employees in the company.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
These three levels of the hierarchy needs

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
relate to the five levels

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
of Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
But as we started asking ourselves about how we were addressing

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
the higher needs of our employees and our customers,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
I realized we had no metrics.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
We had nothing that actually could tell us whether we were actually getting it right.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
So we started asking ourselves:

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
What kind of less obvious metrics

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
could we use to actually evaluate

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
our employees' sense of meaning,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
or our customers' sense of emotional connection with us?

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
For example, we actually started asking our employees,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
do they understand the mission of our company,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and do they feel like they believe in it,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
can they actually influence it,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
and do they feel that their work actually has an impact on it?

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
We started asking our customers,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
did they feel an emotional connection with us,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
in one of seven different kinds of ways.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Miraculously, as we asked these questions

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
and started giving attention higher up the pyramid,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
what we found is we created more loyalty.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Our customer loyalty skyrocketed.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Our employee turnover dropped

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
to one-third of the industry average,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
and during that five year dotcom bust,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
we tripled in size.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
As I went out and started spending time with other leaders out there

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
and asking them how they were getting through that time,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
what they told me over and over again

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
was that they just manage what they can measure.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
What we can measure is that tangible stuff

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
at the bottom of the pyramid.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
They didn't even see the intangible stuff

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
higher up the pyramid.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
So I started asking myself the question:

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
How can we get leaders to start valuing the intangible?

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
If we're taught as leaders to just manage what we can measure,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and all we can measure is the tangible in life,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
we're missing a whole lot of things at the top of the pyramid.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
So I went out and studied a bunch of things,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
and I found a survey that showed

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
that 94 percent

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
of business leaders worldwide

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
believe that the intangibles are important in their business,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
things like intellectual property,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
their corporate culture, their brand loyalty,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
and yet, only five percent of those same leaders

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
actually had a means of measuring the intangibles in their business.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
So as leaders, we understand

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
that intangibles are important,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
but we don't have a clue how to measure them.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
So here's another Einstein quote:

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
"Not everything that can be counted counts,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
and not everything that counts can be counted."

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
I hate to argue with Einstein,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
but if that which is most valuable

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
in our life and our business

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
actually can't be counted or valued,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
aren't we going to spend our lives

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
just mired in measuring the mundane?

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
It was that sort of heady question about what counts

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
that led me to take my CEO hat off for a week

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
and fly off to the Himalayan peaks.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
I flew off to a place that's been shrouded in mystery for centuries,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
a place some folks call Shangri-La.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
It's actually moved from the survival base of the pyramid

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
to becoming a transformational

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
role model for the world.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
I went to Bhutan.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
The teenage king of Bhutan was also a curious man,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
but this was back in 1972,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
when he ascended to the throne

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
two days after his father passed away.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
At age 17, he started asking the kinds of questions

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
that you'd expect of someone with a beginner's mind.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
On a trip through India,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
early in his reign as king,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
he was asked by an Indian journalist

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
about the Bhutanese GDP,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
the size of the Bhutanese GDP.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
The king responded in a fashion

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
that actually has transformed us four decades later.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
He said the following, he said: "Why are we so obsessed

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
and focused with gross domestic product?

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Why don't we care more about

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
gross national happiness?"

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Now, in essence, the king was asking us to consider

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
an alternative definition of success,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
what has come to be known as

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
GNH, or gross national happiness.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Most world leaders didn't take notice,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
and those that did thought this was just "Buddhist economics."

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
But the king was serious.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
This was a notable moment,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
because this was the first time a world leader

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
in almost 200 years

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
had suggested

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
that intangible of happiness --

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
that leader 200 years ago,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Thomas Jefferson with the Declaration of Independence --

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
200 years later,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
this king was suggesting that intangible of happiness

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
is something that we should measure,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
and it's something we should actually value

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
as government officials.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
For the next three dozen years as king,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
this king actually started measuring

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
and managing around happiness in Bhutan --

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
including, just recently, taking his country

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
from being an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
with no bloodshed, no coup.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Bhutan, for those of you who don't know it,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
is the newest democracy in the world, just two years ago.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
So as I spent time with leaders in the GNH movement,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
I got to really understand what they're doing.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And I got to spend some time with the prime minister.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Over dinner, I asked him an impertinent question.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
I asked him,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
"How can you create and measure

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
something which evaporates --

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
in other words, happiness?"

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
And he's a very wise man, and he said,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
"Listen, Bhutan's goal is not to create happiness.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
We create the conditions for happiness to occur.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
In other words, we create a habitat of happiness."

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Wow, that's interesting.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
He said that they have a science behind that art,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
and they've actually created four essential pillars,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
nine key indicators

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
and 72 different metrics

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
that help them to measure their GNH.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
One of those key indicators is:

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
How do the Bhutanese feel about

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
how they spend their time each day?

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
It's a good question. How do you feel about

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
how you spend your time each day?

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Time is one of the scarcest resources

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
in the modern world.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
And yet, of course,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
that little intangible piece of data

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
doesn't factor into our GDP calculations.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
As I spent my week up in the Himalayas,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
I started to imagine

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
what I call an emotional equation.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
And it focuses on something I read long ago

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
from a guy named Rabbi Hyman Schachtel.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
How many know him? Anybody?

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
1954, he wrote a book called "The Real Enjoyment of Living,"

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
and he suggested that happiness

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
is not about having what you want;

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
instead, it's about wanting what you have.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Or in other words, I think the Bhutanese believe

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
happiness equals wanting what you have --

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
imagine gratitude --

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
divided by having what you want --

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
gratification.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
The Bhutanese aren't on some aspirational treadmill,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
constantly focused on what they don't have.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Their religion, their isolation,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
their deep respect for their culture

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
and now the principles of their GNH movement

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
all have fostered a sense of gratitude

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
about what they do have.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
How many of us here, as TEDsters in the audience,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
spend more of our time

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
in the bottom half of this equation, in the denominator?

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
We are a bottom-heavy culture

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
in more ways than one.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
(Laughter)

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
The reality is, in Western countries,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
quite often we do focus on the pursuit of happiness

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
as if happiness is something that we have to go out --

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
an object that we're supposed to get, or maybe many objects.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Actually, in fact, if you look in the dictionary,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
many dictionaries define pursuit

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
as to "chase with hostility."

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Do we pursue happiness with hostility?

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Good question. But back to Bhutan.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Bhutan's bordered on its north and south

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
by 38 percent of the world's population.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Could this little country,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
like a startup in a mature industry,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
be the spark plug that influences

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
a 21st century

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
of middle-class in China and India?

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Bhutan's created the ultimate export,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
a new global currency of well-being,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
and there are 40 countries around the world today

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
that are studying their own GNH.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
You may have heard, this last fall

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Nicolas Sarkozy in France

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
announcing the results of an 18-month study

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
by two Nobel economists,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
focusing on happiness and wellness in France.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Sarkozy suggested that

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
world leaders should stop

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
myopically focusing on GDP

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
and consider a new index,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
what some French are calling a "joie de vivre index."

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
I like it.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Co-branding opportunities.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Just three days ago, three days ago here at TED,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
we had a simulcast of David Cameron,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
potentially the next prime minister of the UK,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
quoting one of my favorite speeches of all-time,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Robert Kennedy's poetic speech from 1968

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
when he suggested that we're

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
myopically focused on the wrong thing

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
and that GDP is a misplaced metric.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
So it suggests that the momentum is shifting.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
I've taken that Robert Kennedy quote,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
and I've turned it into a new balance sheet for just a moment here.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
This is a collection of things

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
that Robert Kennedy said in that quote.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
GDP counts everything from air pollution

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
to the destruction of our redwoods.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
But it doesn't count the health of our children

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
or the integrity of our public officials.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
As you look at these two columns here,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
doesn't it make you feel like it's time for us

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
to start figuring out a new way to count,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
a new way to imagine

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
what's important to us in life?

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
(Applause)

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Certainly Robert Kennedy suggested at the end of the speech exactly that.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
He said GDP "measures everything in short,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
except that which makes life worthwhile."

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Wow.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
So how do we do that?

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Let me say one thing we can just start doing

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
ten years from now, at least in this country.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Why in the heck in America

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
are we doing a census in 2010?

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
We're spending 10 billion dollars on the census.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
We're asking 10 simple questions -- it is simplicity.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
But all of those questions are tangible.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
They're about demographics.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
They're about where you live, how many people you live with,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
and whether you own your home or not.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
That's about it.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
We're not asking meaningful metrics.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
We're not asking important questions.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
We're not asking anything that's intangible.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Abe Maslow said long ago

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
something you've heard before, but you didn't realize it was him.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
He said, "If the only tool you have is a hammer,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
everything starts to look like a nail."

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
We've been fooled by our tool.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Excuse that expression.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
(Laughter)

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
We've been fooled by our tool.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
GDP has been our hammer.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
And our nail has been a 19th- and 20th-century

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
industrial-era model of success.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
And yet, 64 percent

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
of the world's GDP today

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
is in that intangible industry we call service,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
the service industry, the industry I'm in.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
And only 36 percent is in the tangible industries

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
of manufacturing and agriculture.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
So maybe it's time that we get a bigger toolbox, right?

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Maybe it's time we get a toolbox that

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
doesn't just count what's easily counted, the tangible in life,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
but actually counts what we most value,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
the things that are intangible.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
I guess I'm sort of a curious CEO.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
I was also a curious economics major as an undergrad.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
I learned that economists measure everything

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
in tangible units of production and consumption

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
as if each of those tangible units

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
is exactly the same.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
They aren't the same.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
In fact, as leaders, what we need to learn

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
is that we can influence

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
the quality of that unit of production

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
by creating the conditions

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
for our employees to live their calling.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
In Vivian's case,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
her unit of production

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
isn't the tangible hours she works,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
it's the intangible difference she makes

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
during that one hour of work.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
This is Dave Arringdale who's actually

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
been a longtime guest at Vivian's motel.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
He stayed there a hundred times

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
in the last 20 years,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
and he's loyal to the property because of the relationship

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
that Vivian and her fellow employees have created with him.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
They've created a habitat of happiness for Dave.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
He tells me that he can always count

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
on Vivian and the staff there

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
to make him feel at home.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Why is it that

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
business leaders and investors

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
quite often don't see the connection

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
between creating the intangible

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
of employee happiness

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
with creating the tangible

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
of financial profits in their business?

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
We don't have to choose between

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
inspired employees and sizable profits,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
we can have both.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
In fact, inspired employees quite often

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
help make sizable profits, right?

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
So what the world needs now,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
in my opinion,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
is business leaders and political leaders

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
who know what to count.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
We count numbers.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
We count on people.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
What really counts is when we actually use our numbers

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
to truly take into account our people.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
I learned that from a maid in a motel

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
and a king of a country.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
What can you

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
start counting today?

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
What one thing can you start counting today

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
that actually would be meaningful in your life,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
whether it's your work life or your business life?

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Thank you very much.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:16.000
(Applause)
