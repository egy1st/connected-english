00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This is me. My name is Ben Saunders.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I specialize in dragging heavy things

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
around cold places.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
On May 11th last year,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I stood alone at the North geographic Pole.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I was the only human being in an area

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
one-and-a-half times the size of America,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
five-and-a-half thousand square miles.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
More than 2,000 people have climbed Everest.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
12 people have stood on the moon.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Including me, only four people

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
have skied solo to the North Pole.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And I think the reason for that --

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
(Applause)

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
-- thank you -- I think the reason for that is that it's -- it's --

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
well, it's as Chris said, bonkers.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
It's a journey that is right at the limit

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
of human capability.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I skied the equivalent of 31 marathons

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
back to back. 800 miles in 10 weeks.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And I was dragging all the food I needed,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
the supplies, the equipment, sleeping bag,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
one change of underwear -- everything I needed for nearly three months.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
(Laughter)

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
What we're going to try and do today, in the 16 and a bit minutes I've got left,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
is to try and answer three questions. The first one is, why?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
The second one is,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
how do you go to the loo at minus 40?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
"Ben, I've read somewhere that at minus 40,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
exposed skin becomes frostbitten in less than a minute, so how do you answer the call of nature?"

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I don't want to answer these now. I'll come on to them at the end.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Third one: how do you top that? What's next?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
It all started back in 2001.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
My first expedition was with a guy called Pen Hadow -- enormously experienced chap.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
This was like my polar apprenticeship.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
We were trying to ski from this group of islands up here,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Severnaya Zemlya, to the North Pole.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And the thing that fascinates me about the North Pole,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
geographic North Pole, is that it's slap bang in the middle of the sea.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
This is about as good as maps get,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and to reach it you've got to ski literally

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
over the frozen crust,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
the floating skin of ice on the Artic Ocean.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I'd spoken to all the experts.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I'd read lots of books. I studied maps and charts.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
But I realized on the morning of day one

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
that I had no idea exactly

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
what I'd let myself in for.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I was 23 years old. No one my age

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
had attempted anything like this,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and pretty quickly, almost everything

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
that could have gone wrong did go wrong.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
We were attacked by a polar bear on day two.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I had frostbite in my left big toe.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
We started running very low on food. We were both pretty hungry, losing lots of weight.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Some very unusual weather conditions, very difficult ice conditions.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
We had

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
decidedly low-tech communications.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
We couldn't afford a satellite phone, so we had HF radio.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
You can see two ski poles sticking out of the roof of the tent.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
There's a wire dangling down either side.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
That was our HF radio antenna.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
We had less than two hours

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
two-way communication with the outside world in two months.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Ultimately, we ran out of time.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
We'd skied 400 miles. We were just over 200 miles left

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
to go to the Pole, and we'd run out of time.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
We were too late into the summer; the ice was starting to melt;

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
we spoke to the Russian helicopter pilots on the radio,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
and they said, "Look boys, you've run out of time.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
We've got to pick you up."

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And I felt that I had failed, wholeheartedly.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I was a failure.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
The one goal, the one dream I'd had

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
for as long as I could remember -- I hadn't even come close.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And skiing along that first trip, I had two

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
imaginary video clips that I'd replay over and over again in my mind

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
when the going got tough, just to keep my motivation going.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
The first one was reaching the Pole itself.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
I could see vividly, I suppose,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
being filmed out of the door of a helicopter, there was, kind of, rock music playing in the background,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
and I had a ski pole with a Union Jack, you know, flying in the wind.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
I could see myself sticking the flag in a pole, you know --

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
ah, glorious moment -- the music kind of reaching a crescendo.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
The second video clip

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
that I imagined was getting back to Heathrow airport,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and I could see again, vividly,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
the camera flashbulbs going off,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
the paparazzi, the autograph hunters,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
the book agents coming to sign me up for a deal.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And of course, neither of these things happened.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
We didn't get to the Pole, and we didn't have any money

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
to pay anyone to do the PR, so no one had heard

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
of this expedition.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And I got back to Heathrow. My mum was there; my brother was there;

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
my granddad was there -- had a little Union Jack --

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
(Laughter)

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
-- and that was about it. I went back to live with my mum.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
I was physically exhausted,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
mentally an absolute wreck, considered myself a failure.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
In a huge amount of debt personally to this expedition,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
and lying on my mum's sofa,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
day in day out, watching daytime TV.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
My brother sent me a text message, an SMS --

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
it was a quote from the "Simpsons." It said,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
"You tried your hardest and failed miserably.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
The lesson is: don't even try."

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000
(Laughter)

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Fast forward three years. I did eventually get off the sofa,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
and start planning another expedition. This time,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
I wanted to go right across, on my own this time,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
from Russia, at the top of the map,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
to the North Pole, where the sort of kink in the middle is,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
and then on to Canada.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
No one has made a complete crossing of the Arctic Ocean on their own.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Two Norwegians did it as a team in 2000. No one's done it solo.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Very famous, very accomplished Italian mountaineer,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Reinhold Messner, tried it in 1995,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
and he was rescued after a week.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
He described this expedition as 10 times

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
as dangerous as Everest.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
So for some reason, this was what I wanted to have a crack at,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
but I knew that even to stand a chance of getting home in one piece,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
let alone make it across to Canada,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
I had to take a radical approach.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
This meant everything from perfecting the

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
sawn-off, sub-two-gram toothbrush,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
to working with one of the world's leading nutritionists

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
in developing a completely new,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
revolutionary nutritional strategy from scratch:

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
6,000 calories a day.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
And the expedition started in February last year.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Big support team. We had a film crew,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
a couple of logistics people with us,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
my girlfriend, a photographer.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
At first it was pretty sensible. We flew British Airways to Moscow.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
The next bit in Siberia to Krasnoyarsk,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
on a Russian internal airline called KrasAir,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
spelled K-R-A-S.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
The next bit, we'd chartered a pretty elderly Russian plane

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
to fly us up to a town called Khatanga,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
which was the sort of last bit of civilization.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Our cameraman, who it turned out was a pretty nervous flier at the best of times,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
actually asked the pilot, before we got on the plane, how long this flight would take,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
and the pilot -- Russian pilot -- completely deadpan, replied,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
"Six hours -- if we live."

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
(Laughter)

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
We got to Khatanga.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
I think the joke is that Khatanga isn't the end of the world,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
but you can see it from there.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000
(Laughter)

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
It was supposed to be an overnight stay. We were stuck there for 10 days.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
There was a kind of vodka-fueled pay dispute between

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
the helicopter pilots and the people that owned the helicopter,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
so we were stuck. We couldn't move.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Finally, morning of day 11, we got the all-clear,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
loaded up the helicopters -- two helicopters flying in tandem --

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
dropped me off at the edge of the pack ice.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
We had a frantic sort of 45 minutes of filming,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
photography; while the helicopter was still there,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
I did an interview on the satellite phone;

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and then everyone else climbed back into the helicopter,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
wham, the door closed, and I was alone.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And I don't know if words will ever quite do that moment justice.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
All I could think about was running back up to the door,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
banging on the door, and saying, "Look guys,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
I haven't quite thought this through."

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000
(Laughter)

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
To make things worse, you can just see the white dot

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
up at the top right hand side of the screen; that's a full moon.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Because we'd been held up in Russia, of course,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
the full moon brings the highest and lowest tides;

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
when you're standing on the frozen surface of the sea,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
high and low tides generally mean

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
that interesting things are going to happen -- the ice is going to start moving around a bit.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
I was, you can see there, pulling two sledges.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Grand total in all, 95 days of food and fuel,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
180 kilos -- that's almost exactly 400 pounds.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
When the ice was flat or flattish,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
I could just about pull both.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
When the ice wasn't flat, I didn't have a hope in hell.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
I had to pull one, leave it, and go back and get the other one.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Literally scrambling through what's called pressure ice --

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
the ice had been smashed up under the pressure of the currents of the ocean,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
the wind and the tides.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
NASA described the ice conditions last year as the worst since records began.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
And it's always drifting. The pack ice is always drifting.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
I was skiing into headwinds for nine

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
out of the 10 weeks I was alone last year,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
and I was drifting backwards most of the time.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
My record was minus 2.5 miles.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
I got up in the morning, took the tent down, skied north for seven-and-a-half hours,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
put the tent up, and I was two and a half miles further back

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
than when I'd started.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
I literally couldn't keep up with the drift of the ice.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
(Video): So it's day 22.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
I'm lying in the tent, getting ready to go.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
The weather is just appalling --

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
oh, drifted back about five miles

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
in the last -- last night.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Later in the expedition, the problem was no longer the ice.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
It was a lack of ice -- open water.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
I knew this was happening. I knew the Artic was warming.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
I knew there was more open water. And I had a secret weapon up my sleeve.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
This was my little bit of bio-mimicry.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Polar bears on the Artic Ocean move in dead straight lines.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
If they come to water, they'll climb in, swim across it.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
So we had a dry suit developed -- I worked with a team in Norway --

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
based on a sort of survival suit --

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
I suppose, that helicopter pilots would wear --

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
that I could climb into. It would go on over my boots, over my mittens,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
it would pull up around my face, 
and seal pretty tightly around my face.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
And this meant I could ski

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
over very thin ice,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
and if I fell through, it wasn't the end of the world.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
It also meant, if the worst came to the worst,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
I could actually jump in and swim across

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
and drag the sledge over after me.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Some pretty radical technology,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
a radical approach --but it worked perfectly.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Another exciting thing we did last year

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
was with communications technology.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
In 1912, Shackleton's Endurance expedition --

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
there was -- one of his crew, a guy called Thomas Orde-Lees.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
He said, "The explorers of 2012,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
if there is anything left to explore,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
will no doubt carry pocket wireless telephones

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
fitted with wireless telescopes."

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Well, Orde-Lees guessed wrong by about eight years. This is my pocket wireless telephone,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Iridium satellite phone.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
The wireless telescope was a digital camera I had tucked in my pocket.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
And every single day of the 72 days I was alone on the ice,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
I was blogging live from my tent,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
sending back a little diary piece,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
sending back information on the distance I'd covered --

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
the ice conditions, the temperature --

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
and a daily photo.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Remember, 2001,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
we had less than two hours radio contact with the outside world.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Last year, blogging live from an expedition

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
that's been described as 10 times as dangerous as Everest.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
It wasn't all high-tech. This is navigating

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
in what's called a whiteout.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
When you get lots of mist, low cloud, the wind starts blowing the snow up.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
You can't see an awful lot. You can just see, there's a yellow

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
ribbon tied to one of my ski poles.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
I'd navigate using the direction of the wind.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
So, kind of a weird combination of high-tech and low-tech.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
I got to the Pole on the 11th of May.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
It took me 68 days to get there from Russia,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
and there is nothing there.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
(Laughter).

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
There isn't even a pole at the Pole. There's nothing there,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
purely because it's sea ice. It's drifting.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Stick a flag there, leave it there, pretty soon it will drift off, usually towards Canada or Greenland.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
I knew this, but I was expecting something.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Strange mixture of feelings: it was extremely warm by this stage,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
a lot of open water around, and

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
of course, elated that I'd got there under my own steam,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
but starting to really realize

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
that my chances of making it all the way across to Canada,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
which was still 400 miles away,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
were slim at best.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
The only proof I've got that I was there

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
is a blurry photo of my GPS, the little satellite navigation gadget.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
You can just see --

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
there's a nine and a string of zeros here.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Ninety degrees north -- that is slap bang in the North Pole.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
I took a photo of that. Sat down on my sledge. Did a sort of video diary piece.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Took a few photos. I got my satellite phone out.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
I warmed the battery up in my armpit.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
I dialed three numbers. I dialed my mum.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
I dialed my girlfriend. I dialed the CEO of my sponsor.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
And I got three voicemails.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
(Laughter)

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
(Video): Ninety.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
It's a special feeling.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
The entire planet

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
is rotating

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
beneath my feet.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
The -- the whole world underneath me.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
I finally got through to my mum. She was at the queue of the supermarket.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
She started crying. She asked me to call her back.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000
(Laughter)

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
I skied on for a week past the Pole.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
I wanted to get as close to Canada as I could

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
before conditions just got too dangerous to continue.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
This was the last day I had on the ice.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
When I spoke to the -- my project management team,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
they said, "Look, Ben, conditions are getting too dangerous.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
There are huge areas of open water just south of your position.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
We'd like to pick you up.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Ben, could you please look for an airstrip?"

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
This was the view outside my tent

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
when I had this fateful phone call.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
I'd never tried to build an airstrip before. Tony, the expedition manager, he said,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
"Look Ben, you've got to find 500 meters of

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
flat, thick safe ice."

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
The only bit of ice I could find --

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
it took me 36 hours of skiing around trying to find an airstrip --

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
was exactly 473 meters. I could measure it with my skis.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
I didn't tell Tony that. I didn't tell the pilots that.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
I thought, it'll have to do.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
(Video): Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
It just about worked. A pretty dramatic landing --

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
the plane actually passed over four times,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
and I was a bit worried it wasn't going to land at all.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
The pilot, I knew, was called Troy. I was expecting someone called Troy

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
that did this for a living to be a pretty tough kind of guy.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
I was bawling my eyes out by the time the plane landed -- a pretty emotional moment.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
So I thought, I've got to compose myself for Troy.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
I'm supposed to be the roughty toughty explorer type.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
The plane taxied up to where I was standing.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
The door opened. This guy jumped out. He's about that tall. He said, "Hi, my name is Troy."

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
(Laughter).

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
The co-pilot was a lady called Monica.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
She sat there in a sort of hand-knitted jumper.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
They were the least macho people I've ever met, but they made my day.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Troy was smoking a cigarette on the ice;

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
we took a few photos. He

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
climbed up the ladder. He said, "Just -- just get in the back."

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
He threw his cigarette out as he got on the front,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
and I climbed in the back.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000
(Laughter)

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Taxied up and down the runway a few times,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
just to flatten it out a bit, and he said, "Right, I'm going to --

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
I'm going to give it a go." And he --

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
I've now learned that this is standard practice, but it had me worried at the time.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
He put his hand on the throttle.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
You can see the control for the engines is actually on the roof of the cockpit.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
It's that little bar there. He put his hand on the throttle.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Monica very gently put her hand sort of on top of his.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
I thought, "God, here we go. We're, we're -- this is all or nothing."

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Rammed it forwards. Bounced down the runway. Just took off.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
One of the skis just clipped a pressure ridge at the end of the runway,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
banking. I could see into the cockpit, Troy battling the controls,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
and he just took one hand off, reached back,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
flipped a switch on the roof of the cockpit,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
and it was the "fasten seat belt" sign you can see on the wall.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
(Laughter)

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
And only from the air did I see the big picture.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Of course, when you're on the ice, you only ever see one obstacle at a time,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
whether it's a pressure ridge or there's a bit of water.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
This is probably why I didn't get into trouble about the length of my airstrip.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
I mean, it really was starting to break up.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Why? I'm not an explorer in the traditional sense.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
I'm not skiing along drawing maps;

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
everyone knows where the North Pole is.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
At the South Pole there's a big scientific base. There's an airstrip.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
There's a cafe and there's a tourist shop.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
For me, this is about exploring human limits,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
about exploring the limits of physiology, of psychology

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
and of technology. They're the things that excite me.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
And it's also about potential, on a personal level.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
This, for me, is a chance to explore the limits --

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
really push the limits of my own potential, see how far they stretch.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
And on a wider scale, it amazes me how people go through life

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
just scratching the surface of their potential,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
just doing three or four or five percent

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
of what they're truly capable of. So,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
on a wider scale, I hope that this journey

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
was a chance to inspire other people

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
to think about what they want to do

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
with their potential, and what they want to do with the tiny amount of time

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
we each have on this planet.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
That's as close as I can come to summing that up.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
The next question is, how do you answer the call of nature at minus 40?

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
The answer, of course, to which is a trade secret --

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
and the last question,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
what's next? As quickly as possible,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
if I have a minute left at the end, I'll go into more detail.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
What's next:

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Antarctica.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
It's the coldest, highest,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
windiest and driest continent on Earth.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
Late 1911, early 1912,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
there was a race to be the first

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000
to the South Pole: the heart of the Antarctic continent.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
If you include the coastal ice shelves, you can see that the Ross Ice Shelf --

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
it's the big one down here -- the Ross Ice Shelf is the size of France.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Antarctica, if you include the ice shelves,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
is twice the size of Australia -- it's a big place.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
And there's a race to get to the Pole between Amundsen,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
the Norwegian -- Amundsen had dog sleds and huskies --

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
and Scott, the British guy, Captain Scott.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Scott had sort of ponies and some tractors

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
and a few dogs, all of which went wrong,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
and Scott and his team of four people ended up on foot.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
They got to the Pole late January 1912

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
to find a Norwegian flag already there.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
There was a tent, a letter to the Norwegian king.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
And they turned around, headed back to the coast,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
and all five of them died on the return journey.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Since then, no one has ever skied --

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
this was 93 years ago -- since then, no one has ever skied

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
from the coast of Antarctica to the Pole and back.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Every South Pole expedition you may have heard about

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
is either flown out from the Pole or has used vehicles

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
or dogs or kites to do some kind of crossing --

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
no one has ever made a return journey. So that's the plan.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Two of us are doing it.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
That's pretty much it.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
One final thought before I get to the toilet bit, is --

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
is, I have a -- and I meant to scan this and I've forgotten --

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
but I have a -- I have a school report. I was 13 years old,

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
and it's framed above my desk at home. It says,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
"Ben lacks sufficient impetus

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
to achieve anything worthwhile."

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000
(Laughter)

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
(Applause)

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
I think if I've learned anything, it's this: that no one else

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
is the authority on your potential.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
You're the only person that decides how far you go and what you're capable of.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Ladies and gentlemen, that's my story.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Thank you very much.
