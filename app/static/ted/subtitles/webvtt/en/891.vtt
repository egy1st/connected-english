00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm going to begin by reciting a poem.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
"Oh beloved dentist:

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Your rubber fingers in my mouth ...

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
your voice so soft and muffled ...

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Lower the mask, dear dentist,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
lower the mask."

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
(Laughter)

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Okay, in this presentation,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I'm going to be putting the right side of your brains

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
through a fairly serious workout.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
You're going to see a lot of imagery,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and it's not always connected to what I'm talking about,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
so I need you to kind of split your brains in half

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and let the images flow over one side

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and listen to me on the other.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So I am one of those people

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
with a transformative personal story.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Six years ago,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
after 20 years in graphic design and typography,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I changed the way I was working

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and the way most graphic designers work

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
to pursue a more personal approach to my work,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
with only the humble attempt

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
to simply make a living doing something that I loved.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
But something weird happened.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I became bizarrely

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
popular.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
My current work

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
seems to resonate with people

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
in a way that has so taken me by surprise

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
that I still frequently wonder

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
what in the hell is going on.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
And I'm slowly coming to understand

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
that the appeal of what I do

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
may be connected to why I do it.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
These days, I call myself a graphic artist.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
So where my work as a graphic designer

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
was to follow strategy,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
my work now

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
follows my heart

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and my interests

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
with the guidance of my ego

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
to create work that is mutually beneficial to myself and a client.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Now, this is heresy

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
in the design world.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
The ego is not supposed

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
to be involved in graphic design.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
But I find that for myself,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
without exception,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
the more I deal with the work

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
as something of my own,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
as something that is personal,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
the more successful it is

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
as something that's compelling,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
interesting and sustaining.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
So I exist somewhat outside of the mainstream

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
of design thinking.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Where others might look at measurable results,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
I tend to be interested in more ethereal qualities,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
like "Does it bring joy?"

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
"Is there a sense of wonder?"

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and "Does it invoke curiosity?"

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
This is a scientific diagram, by the way.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I don't have time to explain it,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
but it has to do with DNA and RNA.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
So I have a particular imaginative approach to visual work.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
The things that interest me when I'm working

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
are visual structure,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
surprise

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
and anything that requires figuring things out.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
So for this reason, I'm particularly drawn

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
to systems and patterns.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
I'm going to give you a couple of examples of how my brain works.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
This is a piece that I did for

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
The Guardian newspaper in the U.K.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
They have a magazine that they call G2.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And this is for their puzzle special

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
in 2007.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And puzzling it is.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
I started by creating a series of tiling units.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
And these tiling units, I designed

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
specifically so that they would contain

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
parts of letterforms within their shapes

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
so that I could then

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
join those pieces together

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
to create letters and then words

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
within the abstract patterning.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
But then as well, I was able to

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
just flip them, rotate them

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and combine them in different ways

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
to create either regular patterns

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
or abstract patterns.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
So here's the word puzzle again.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And here it is with the abstract surrounding.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And as you can see, it's extremely difficult to read.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
But all I have to do is

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
fill certain areas of those letterforms

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
and I can bring those words out of

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
the background pattern.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
But maybe that's a little too obvious.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
So then I can add some color in with the background

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
and add a bit more color in with the words themselves,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
and this way, working with the art director,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
I'm able to bring it to just the right point

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
that it's puzzling for the audience --

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
they can figure out that there's something they have to read --

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
but it's not impossible for them to read.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
I'm also interested in working with

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
unusual materials

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
and common materials in unusual ways.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
So this requires figuring out how to

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
get the most out of something's innate properties

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
and also how to bend it to my will.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
So ultimately,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
my goal is to create something unexpected.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
To this end, I have worked in sugar

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
for Stefan Sagmeister,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
three-time TED speaker.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
And this project began essentially

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
on my kitchen table.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
I've been eating cereal for breakfast

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
all of my life.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
And for that same amount of time,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
I've been spilling sugar on the table

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
and just kind of playing with it with my fingers.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And eventually I used this technique

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
to create a piece of artwork.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And then I used it again to create

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
six pieces for Stefan's book,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
"Things in My Life I've Learned So Far."

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
And these were created

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
without sketches, just freehand,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
by putting the sugar down on a white surface

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
and then manipulating it to get

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
the words and designs out of it.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Recently, I've also made some

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
rather highbrow baroque borders

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
out of lowbrow pasta.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
And this is for a chapter that I'm doing in a book,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
and the chapter is on honor.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
So it's a little bit unexpected,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
but, in a way, it refers

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
to the macaroni art

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
that children make for their parents

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
or they make in school and give to their parents,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
which is in itself a form of honor.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
This is what you can do with some household tinfoil.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Okay, well, it's what I can do with some household tinfoil.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000
(Laughter)

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
I'm very interested in wonder,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
in design as an impetus to inquiring.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
To say I wonder is to say

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
I question, I ask.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
And to experience wonder is to experience awe.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
So I'm currently working on a book,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
which plays with both senses of the word,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
as I explore some of my own ideas

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
and inquiries

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
in a visual display of rather

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
peacock-like grandeur.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
The world is full of wonder.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
But the world of graphic design,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
for the most part, is not.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
So I'm using my own writings

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
as a kind of testing ground for a book that has

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
an interdependency between word and image

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
as a kind of seductive force.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
I think that one of the things

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
that religions got right

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
was the use of visual wonder

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
to deliver a message.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
I think this true marriage of art and information

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
is woefully underused in adult literature,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
and I'm mystified as to

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
why visual wealth is not more commonly used

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
to enhance intellectual wealth.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
When we look at works like this,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
we tend to associate them with children's literature.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
There's an implication that ornamental graphics

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
detract from the seriousness of the content.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
But I really hope to have the opportunity

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
to change that perception.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
This book is taking rather a long time,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
but I'm nearly done.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
For some reason, I thought it would be a good idea

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
to put an intermission

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
in my talk.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And this is it -- just to give you and me a moment to catch up.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
(Laughter)

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
So I do these valentines.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
I've been sending out valentines

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
on a fairly large scale since 2005.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
These are my valentines

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
from 2005 and 2006.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
And I started by

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
doing just a single image like this

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
and sending them out to each person.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
But in 2007,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
I got the cockamamie idea

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
to hand-draw each valentine

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
for everyone on my mailing list.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
I reduced my mailing list to 150 people.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
And I drew each person

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
their own unique valentine

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
and put their name on it

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
and numbered it and signed it and sent it out.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Believe it or not, I devised this

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
as a timesaving method.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
I was very busy in the beginning of that year,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
and I didn't know when I was going to find time

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
to design and print a single valentine.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And I thought that I could kind of do this piecemeal

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
as I was traveling.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
It didn't exactly work out that way.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
There's a longer story to this,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
but I did get them all done in time,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
and they were extremely well received.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
I got an almost 100 percent response rate.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
(Laughter)

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
And those who didn't respond

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
will never receive anything from me ever again.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
(Laughter)

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Last year,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
I took a more conceptual approach to the valentine.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
I had this idea that I wanted people

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
to receive a kind of

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
mysterious love letter,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
like a found fragment in their mailbox.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
I wanted it to be something

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
that was not addressed to them

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
or signed by me,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
something that caused them to wonder

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
what on Earth this thing was.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
And I specifically wrote

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
four pages that don't connect.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
There were four different versions of this.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
And I wrote them

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
so that they begin in the middle of a sentence,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
end in the middle of a sentence.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
And they're on the one hand, universal,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
so I avoid specific names or places,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
but on the other hand, they're personal.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
So I wanted people to really get the sense that

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
they had received something that could have been

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
a love letter to them.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
And I'm just going to read one of them to you.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
"You've never really been sure of this,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
but I can assure you that this quirk

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
you're so self-conscious of

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
is intensely endearing.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Just please accept that this piece of you

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
escapes with your smile,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
and those of us who notice

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
are happy to catch it in passing.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Time spent with you is like chasing and catching small birds,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
but without the scratches and bird shit."

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
(Laughter)

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
"That is to say,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
your thoughts and words flit and dart,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
disconcertedly elusive at times,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
but when caught and examined --

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
ahh, such a wonder,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
such a delightful reward.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
There's no passing time with you,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
only collecting --

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
the collecting of moments with the hope for preservation

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
and at the same time release.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Impossible? I don't think so.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
I know this makes you embarrassed.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
I'm certain I can see you blushing.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
But I just have to tell you because

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
sometimes I hear your self-doubt,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
and it's so crushing to think

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
that you may not know how truly wonderful you are,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
how inspiring and delightful

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
and really, truly the most completely ..."

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
(Laughter)

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:37.000
(Applause)

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
So Valentine's Day

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
is coming up in a couple of days,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
and these are currently arriving

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
in mailboxes all around the world.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
This year, I got, what I really have to say

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
is a rather brilliant idea,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
to laser cut

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
my valentines

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
out of used Christmas cards.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
So I solicited friends

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
to send me their used Christmas cards,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
and I made 500 of these.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Each one of them is completely different.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
I'm just really, really thrilled with them.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
I don't have that much else to say,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
but they turned out really well.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
I do spend a lot of time on my work.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
And one of the things that I've been thinking about recently

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
is what is worth while.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
What is it that's worth spending my time on

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
and my life on in this way?

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Working in the commercial world,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
this is something that I do have to struggle with at times.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
And yes, sometimes I'm swayed by money.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
But ultimately, I don't consider that a worthy goal.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
What makes something worthwhile for me

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
is the people I work for or with,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
the conditions I work under

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
and the audience that I'm able to reach.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
So I might ask: "Who is it for?"

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
"What does it say?"

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
and "What does it do?"

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
You know, I have to tell you, it's really difficult

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
for someone like me to come up on stage

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
at this conference

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
with these unbelievably brilliant minds,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
who are thinking these

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
really big-picture,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
world-changing, life-changing

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
ideas and technologies.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
And it's very, very common

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
for designers and people in the visual arts

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
to feel that we're

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
not contributing enough,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
or worse, that all we're doing is

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
contributing to landfill.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Here I am; I'm showing you

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
some pretty visuals

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
and talking about aesthetics.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
But I've come to believe that

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
truly imaginative visual work

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
is extremely important in society.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Just in the way that I'm inspired

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
by books

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
and magazines of all kinds,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
conversations I have, movies,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
so I also think,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
when I put visual work out there into the mass media,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
work that is interesting, unusual,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
intriguing,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
work that maybe opens up that sense

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
of inquiry in the mind,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
that I'm seeding the imagination of the populace.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
And you just never know who

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
is going to take something from that

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
and turn it into something else,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
because inspiration

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
is cross-pollinating.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
So a piece of mine

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
may inspire a playwright

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
or a novelist or a scientist,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
and that in turn may be the seed

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
that inspires a doctor

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
or a philanthropist

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
or a babysitter.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
And this isn't something that you can quantify

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
or track or measure,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
and we tend to undervalue things in society

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
that we can't measure.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
But I really believe

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
that a fully operating, rich society

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
needs these seeds coming from all directions

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
and all disciplines

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
in order to keep the gears of inspiration

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
and imagination

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
flowing and cycling and growing.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
So that's why I do what I do,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
and why I spend so much time and effort on it,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
and why I work in the commercial, public sphere,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
as opposed to the isolated, private sphere

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
of fine art:

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
because I want as many people as possible

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
to see my work, notice it, be drawn into it,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
and be able to take something from it.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
And I actually really feel that it's worthwhile

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
to spend my valuable

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
and limited time on this Earth

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
in this way.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
And I thank you for allowing me to show it to you.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:06.000
(Applause)
