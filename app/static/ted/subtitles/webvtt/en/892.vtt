WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
It's a great pleasure to be here.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
It's a great pleasure to speak after

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Brian Cox from CERN.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I think CERN is the home

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
of the Large Hadron Collider.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
What ever happened to the Small Hadron Collider?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Where is the Small Hadron Collider?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Because the Small Hadron Collider once was the big thing.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Now, the Small Hadron Collider

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
is in a cupboard, overlooked and neglected.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
You know when the Large Hadron Collider started,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and it didn't work, and people tried to work out why,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
it was the Small Hadron Collider team

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
who sabotaged it

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
because they were so jealous.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
The whole Hadron Collider family

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
needs unlocking.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The lesson of Brian's presentation, in a way --

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
all those fantastic pictures --

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
is this really:

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
that vantage point determines everything that you see.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
What Brian was saying was

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
science has opened up successively different vantage points

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
from which we can see ourselves,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and that's why it's so valuable.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So the vantage point you take

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
determines virtually everything that you will see.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
The question that you will ask

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
will determine much of the answer that you get.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And so if you ask this question:

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Where would you look to see the future of education?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
The answer that we've traditionally given to that

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
is very straightforward, at least in the last 20 years:

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
You go to Finland.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Finland is the best place in the world to see school systems.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
The Finns may be a bit boring and depressive and there's a very high suicide rate,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
but by golly, they are qualified.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And they have absolutely amazing education systems.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
So we all troop off to Finland,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and we wonder at the social democratic miracle of Finland

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and its cultural homogeneity and all the rest of it,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and then we struggle to imagine how we might

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
bring lessons back.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Well, so, for this last year,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
with the help of Cisco who sponsored me,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
for some balmy reason, to do this,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I've been looking somewhere else.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Because actually radical innovation does sometimes

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
come from the very best,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
but it often comes from places

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
where you have huge need --

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
unmet, latent demand --

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and not enough resources for traditional solutions to work --

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
traditional, high-cost solutions,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
which depend on professionals,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
which is what schools and hospitals are.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
So I ended up in places like this.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
This is a place called Monkey Hill.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
It's one of the hundreds of favelas in Rio.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Most of the population growth of the next 50 years

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
will be in cities.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
We'll grow by six cities of 12 million people a year

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
for the next 30 years.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Almost all of that growth will be in the developed world.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Almost all of that growth will be

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
in places like Monkey Hill.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
This is where you'll find the fastest growing

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
young populations of the world.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
So if you want recipes to work --

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
for virtually anything -- health, education,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
government politics

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
and education --

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
you have to go to these places.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And if you go to these places, you meet people like this.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
This is a guy called Juanderson.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
At the age of 14,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
in common with many 14-year-olds in the Brazilian education system,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
he dropped out of school.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
It was boring.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And Juanderson, instead, went into

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
what provided kind of opportunity and hope

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
in the place that he lived, which was the drugs trade.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And by the age of 16, with rapid promotion,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
he was running the drugs trade in 10 favelas.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
He was turning over 200,000 dollars a week.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
He employed 200 people.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
He was going to be dead by the age of 25.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And luckily, he met this guy,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
who is Rodrigo Baggio,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
the owner of the first laptop to ever appear in Brazil.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
1994, Rodrigo started something

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
called CDI,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
which took computers

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
donated by corporations,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
put them into community centers in favelas

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and created places like this.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
What turned Juanderson around

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
was technology for learning

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
that made learning fun and accessible.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Or you can go to places like this.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
This is Kibera, which is the largest slum in East Africa.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Millions of people living here,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
stretched over many kilometers.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And there I met these two,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Azra on the left, Maureen on the right.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
They just finished their Kenyan certificate

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
of secondary education.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
That name should tell you that the Kenyan education system

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
borrows almost everything

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
from Britain, circa 1950,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
but has managed to make it even worse.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
So there are schools in slums like this.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
They're places like this.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
That's where Maureen went to school.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
They're private schools. There are no state schools in slums.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
And the education they got was pitiful.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
It was in places like this. This a school set up by some nuns

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
in another slum called Nakuru.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Half the children in this classroom have no parents

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
because they've died through AIDS.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
The other half have one parent

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
because the other parent has died through AIDS.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
So the challenges of education

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
in this kind of place

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
are not to learn the kings and queens of Kenya or Britain.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
They are to stay alive, to earn a living,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
to not become HIV positive.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
The one technology that spans rich and poor

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
in places like this

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
is not anything to do with industrial technology.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
It's not to do with electricity or water.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
It's the mobile phone.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
If you want to design from scratch

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
virtually any service in Africa,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
you would start now with the mobile phone.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Or you could go to places like this.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
This is a place called the Madangiri Settlement Colony,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
which is a very developed slum

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
about 25 minutes outside New Delhi,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
where I met these characters

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
who showed me around for the day.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
The remarkable thing about these girls,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
and the sign of the kind of social revolution

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
sweeping through the developing world

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
is that these girls are not married.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Ten years ago, they certainly would have been married.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Now they're not married, and they want to go on

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
to study further, to have a career.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
They've been brought up by mothers who are illiterate,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
who have never ever done homework.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
All across the developing world there are millions of parents --

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
tens, hundreds of millions --

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
who for the first time

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
are with children doing homework and exams.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
And the reason they carry on studying

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
is not because they went to a school like this.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
This is a private school.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
This is a fee-pay school. This is a good school.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
This is the best you can get

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
in Hyderabad in Indian education.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
The reason they went on studying was this.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
This is a computer installed in the entrance to their slum

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
by a revolutionary social entrepreneur

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
called Sugata Mitra

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
who has conducted the most radical experiments,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
showing that children, in the right conditions,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
can learn on their own with the help of computers.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Those girls have never touched Google.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
They know nothing about Wikipedia.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Imagine what their lives would be like

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
if you could get that to them.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
So if you look, as I did,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
through this tour,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
and by looking at about a hundred case studies

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
of different social entrepreneurs

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
working in these very extreme conditions,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
look at the recipes that they come up with for learning,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
they look nothing like school.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
What do they look like?

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Well, education is a global religion.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And education, plus technology,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
is a great source of hope.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
You can go to places like this.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
This is a school three hours outside of Sao Paulo.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Most of the children there have parents who are illiterate.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Many of them don't have electricity at home.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
But they find it completely obvious

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
to use computers, websites,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
make videos, so on and so forth.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
When you go to places like this

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
what you see is that

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
education in these settings

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
works by pull, not push.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Most of our education system is push.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
I was literally pushed to school.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
When you get to school, things are pushed at you:

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
knowledge, exams,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
systems, timetables.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
If you want to attract people like Juanderson

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
who could, for instance,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
buy guns, wear jewelry,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
ride motorbikes and get girls

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
through the drugs trade,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
and you want to attract him into education,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
having a compulsory curriculum doesn't really make sense.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
That isn't really going to attract him.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
You need to pull him.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
And so education needs to work by pull, not push.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
And so the idea of a curriculum

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
is completely irrelevant in a setting like this.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
You need to start education

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
from things that make a difference

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
to them in their settings.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
What does that?

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Well, the key is motivation, and there are two aspects to it.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
One is to deliver extrinsic motivation,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
that education has a payoff.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Our education systems all work

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
on the principle that there is a payoff,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
but you have to wait quite a long time.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
That's too long if you're poor.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Waiting 10 years for the payoff from education

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
is too long when you need to meet daily needs,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
when you've got siblings to look after

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
or a business to help with.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
So you need education to be relevant and help people

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
to make a living there and then, often.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
And you also need to make it intrinsically interesting.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
So time and again, I found people like this.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
This is an amazing guy, Sebastiao Rocha,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
in Belo Horizonte,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
in the third largest city in Brazil.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
He's invented more than 200 games

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
to teach virtually any subject under the sun.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
In the schools and communities

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
that Taio works in,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
the day always starts in a circle

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
and always starts from a question.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Imagine an education system that started from questions,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
not from knowledge to be imparted,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
or started from a game, not from a lesson,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
or started from the premise

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
that you have to engage people first

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
before you can possibly teach them.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
Our education systems,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
you do all that stuff afterward, if you're lucky,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
sport, drama, music.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
These things, they teach through.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
They attract people to learning

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
because it's really a dance project

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
or a circus project

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
or, the best example of all --

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
El Sistema in Venezuela --

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
it's a music project.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
And so you attract people through that into learning,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
not adding that on after

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
all the learning has been done

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
and you've eaten your cognitive greens.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
So El Sistema in Venezuela

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
uses a violin as a technology of learning.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Taio Rocha uses making soap

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
as a technology of learning.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
And what you find when you go to these schemes

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
is that they use people and places

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
in incredibly creative ways.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Masses of peer learning.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
How do you get learning to people

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
when there are no teachers,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
when teachers won't come, when you can't afford them,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
and even if you do get teachers,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
what they teach isn't relevant to the communities that they serve?

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Well, you create your own teachers.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
You create peer-to-peer learning,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
or you create para-teachers, or you bring in specialist skills.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
But you find ways to get learning that's relevant to people

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
through technology, people and places that are different.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
So this is a school in a bus

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
on a building site

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
in Pune, the fastest growing city in Asia.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Pune has 5,000 building sites.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
It has 30,000 children

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
on those building sites.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
That's one city.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
Imagine that urban explosion

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
that's going to take place across the developing world

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
and how many thousands of children

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
will spend their school years on building sites.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Well, this is a very simple scheme

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
to get the learning to them through a bus.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
And they all treat learning,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
not as some sort of academic, analytical activity,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
but as that's something that's productive,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
something you make,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
something that you can do, perhaps earn a living from.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
So I met this character, Steven.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
He'd spent three years in Nairobi living on the streets

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
because his parents had died of AIDS.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
And he was finally brought back into school,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
not by the offer of GCSEs,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
but by the offer of learning how to become a carpenter,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
a practical making skill.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
So the trendiest schools in the world,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
High Tech High and others,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
they espouse a philosophy of learning as productive activity.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Here, there isn't really an option.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Learning has to be productive

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
in order for it to make sense.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
And finally, they have a different model of scale,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
and it's a Chinese restaurant model

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
of how to scale.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
And I learned it from this guy,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
who is an amazing character.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
He's probably the most remarkable social entrepreneur

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
in education in the world.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
His name is Madhav Chavan,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
and he created something called Pratham.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
And Pratham runs preschool play groups

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
for, now, 21 million children in India.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
It's the largest NGO in education in the world.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
And it also supports working-class kids going into Indian schools.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
He's a complete revolutionary.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
He's actually a trade union organizer by background,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
and that's how he learned the skills

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
to build his organization.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
When they got to a certain stage,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Pratham got big enough to attract

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
some pro bono support from McKinsey.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
McKinsey came along and looked at his model and said,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
"You know what you should do with this, Madhav?

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
You should turn it into McDonald's.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
And what you do when you go to any new site

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
is you kind of roll out a franchise.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
And it's the same wherever you go.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
It's reliable and people know exactly where they are.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
And there will be no mistakes."

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
And Madhav said,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
"Why do we have to do it that way?

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Why can't we do it more like the Chinese restaurants?"

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
There are Chinese restaurants everywhere,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
but there is no Chinese restaurant chain.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Yet, everyone knows what is a Chinese restaurant.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
They know what to expect, even though it'll be subtly different

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
and the colors will be different and the name will be different.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
You know a Chinese restaurant when you see it.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
These people work with the Chinese restaurant model --

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
same principles, different applications and different settings --

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
not the McDonald's model.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
The McDonald's model scales.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
The Chinese restaurant model spreads.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
So mass education

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
started with social entrepreneurship

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
in the 19th century.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
And that's desperately what we need again

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
on a global scale.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
And what can we learn from all of that?

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Well, we can learn a lot

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
because our education systems

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
are failing desperately in many ways.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
They fail to reach the people

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
they most need to serve.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
They often hit their target but miss the point.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Improvement is increasingly

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
difficult to organize;

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
our faith in these systems, incredibly fraught.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
And this is just a very simple way of

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
understanding what kind of innovation,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
what kind of different design we need.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
There are two basic types of innovation.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
There's sustaining innovation,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
which will sustain an existing institution or an organization,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
and disruptive innovation

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
that will break it apart, create some different way of doing it.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
There are formal settings --

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
schools, colleges, hospitals --

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
in which innovation can take place,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
and informal settings -- communities,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
families, social networks.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Almost all our effort goes in this box,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
sustaining innovation in formal settings,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
getting a better version

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
of the essentially Bismarckian school system

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
that developed in the 19th century.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
And as I said, the trouble with this is that,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
in the developing world

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
there just aren't teachers to make this model work.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
You'd need millions and millions of teachers

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
in China, India, Nigeria

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
and the rest of developing world to meet need.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
And in our system, we know

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
that simply doing more of this won't eat into

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
deep educational inequalities,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
especially in inner cities

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
and former industrial areas.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
So that's why we need three more kinds of innovation.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
We need more reinvention.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
And all around the world now you see

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
more and more schools reinventing themselves.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
They're recognizably schools, but they look different.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
There are Big Picture schools

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
in the U.S. and Australia.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
There are Kunskapsskolan schools

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
in Sweden.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Of 14 of them,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
only two of them are in schools.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Most of them are in other buildings not designed as schools.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
There is an amazing school in Northen Queensland

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
called Jaringan.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
And they all have the same kind of features:

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
highly collaborative, very personalized,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
often pervasive technology,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
learning that starts from questions

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
and problems and projects,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
not from knowledge and curriculum.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
So we certainly need more of that.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
But because so many of the issues in education

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
aren't just in school,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
they're in family and community,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
what you also need, definitely,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
is more on the right hand side.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
You need efforts to supplement schools.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
The most famous of these is Reggio Emilia in Italy,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
the family-based learning system

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
to support and encourage people in schools.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
The most exciting is the Harlem Children's Zone,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
which over 10 years, led by Geoffrey Canada,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
has, through a mixture of schooling

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
and family and community projects,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
attempted to transform not just education in schools,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
but the entire culture and aspiration

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
of about 10,000 families in Harlem.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
We need more of that

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
completely new and radical thinking.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
You can go to places an hour away, less,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
from this room,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
just down the road, which need that,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
which need radicalism of a kind that we haven't imagined.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
And finally, you need transformational innovation

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
that could imagine getting learning to people

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
in completely new and different ways.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
So we are on the verge, 2015,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
of an amazing achievement,

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
the schoolification of the world.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Every child up to the age of 15 who wants a place in school

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
will be able to have one in 2015.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
It's an amazing thing.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
But it is,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
unlike cars, which have developed

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
so rapidly and orderly,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
actually the school system is recognizably

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
an inheritance from the 19th century,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
from a Bismarkian model of German schooling

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
that got taken up by English reformers,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
and often by

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
religious missionaries,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
taken up in the United States

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
as a force of social cohesion,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
and then in Japan and South Korea as they developed.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
It's recognizably 19th century in its roots.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
And of course it's a huge achievement.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
And of course it will bring great things.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
It will bring skills and learning and reading.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
But it will also lay waste to imagination.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
It will lay waste to appetite. It will lay waste to social confidence.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
It will stratify society

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
as much as it liberates it.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
And we are bequeathing to the developing world

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
school systems that they will now spend

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
a century trying to reform.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
That is why we need really radical thinking,

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
and why radical thinking is now

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
more possible and more needed than ever in how we learn.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Thank you. (Applause)
