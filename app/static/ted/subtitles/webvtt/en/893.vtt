00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
When I was 10 years old,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
a cousin of mine took me on a tour of his medical school.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And as a special treat,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
he took me to the pathology lab

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and took a real human brain

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
out of the jar

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and placed it in my hands.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And there it was,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
the seat of human consciousness,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
the powerhouse of the human body,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
sitting in my hands.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And that day I knew that when I grew up,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I was going to become a brain doctor,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
scientist, something or the other.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Years later, when I finally grew up,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
my dream came true.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And it was while I was doing my Ph.D.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
on the neurological causes

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
of dyslexia in children

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
that I encountered a startling fact

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
that I'd like to share with you all today.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
It is estimated that one in six children,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
that's one in six children,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
suffer from some developmental disorder.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
This is a disorder that

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
retards mental development in the child

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and causes permanent mental impairments.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Which means that each and every one of you here today

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
knows at least one child that is suffering

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
from a developmental disorder.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
But here's what really perplexed me.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Despite the fact that each

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and every one of these disorders

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
originates in the brain,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
most of these disorders

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
are diagnosed solely on the basis

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
of observable behavior.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
But diagnosing a brain disorder

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
without actually looking at the brain

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
is analogous to treating a patient with a heart problem

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
based on their physical symptoms,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
without even doing an ECG or a chest X-ray

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
to look at the heart.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
It seemed so intuitive to me.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
To diagnose and treat a brain disorder accurately,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
it would be necessary to look at the brain directly.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Looking at behavior alone

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
can miss a vital piece of the puzzle

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and provide an incomplete, or even a misleading,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
picture of the child's problems.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Yet, despite all the advances in medical technology,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
the diagnosis of brain disorders

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
in one in six children

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
still remained so limited.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And then I came across a team at Harvard University

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
that had taken one such advanced medical technology

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
and finally applied it,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
instead of in brain research,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
towards diagnosing brain disorders in children.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Their groundbreaking technology

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
records the EEG, or the electrical activity

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
of the brain, in real time,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
allowing us to watch the brain

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
as it performs various functions

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and then detect even the slightest abnormality

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
in any of these functions:

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
vision, attention, language, audition.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
A program called Brain Electrical

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Activity Mapping

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
then triangulates the source

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
of that abnormality in the brain.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And another program called

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Statistical Probability Mapping

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
then performs mathematical calculations

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
to determine whether any of these abnormalities

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
are clinically significant,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
allowing us to provide a much more accurate

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
neurological diagnosis

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
of the child's symptoms.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
And so I became the head of neurophysiology

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
for the clinical arm of this team,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
and we're finally able to use this technology

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
towards actually helping

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
children with brain disorders.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And I'm happy to say that I'm now in the process

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
of setting up this technology here in India.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
I'd like to tell you about one such child,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
whose story was also covered by ABC News.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Seven-year-old Justin Senigar

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
came to our clinic with this diagnosis

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
of very severe autism.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Like many autistic children,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
his mind was locked inside his body.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
There were moments when he would

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
actually space out for seconds at a time.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And the doctors told his parents

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
he was never going to be able

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
to communicate or interact socially,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
and he would probably never have too much language.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
When we used this groundbreaking EEG technology

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
to actually look at Justin's brain,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
the results were startling.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
It turned out that Justin was almost

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
certainly not autistic.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
He was suffering from brain seizures

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
that were impossible to see with the naked eye,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
but that were actually causing symptoms

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
that mimicked those of autism.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
After Justin was given anti-seizure medication,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
the change in him was amazing.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Within a period of 60 days,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
his vocabulary went from two to three words

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
to 300 words.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And his communication and social interaction

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
were improved so dramatically

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
that he was enrolled into a regular school

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
and even became a karate super champ.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Research shows that 50 percent of children,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
almost 50 percent of children

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
diagnosed with autism

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
are actually suffering from hidden brain seizures.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
These are the faces of the children

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
that I have tested

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
with stories just like Justin.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
All these children

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
came to our clinic with a diagnosis

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
of autism, attention deficit disorder,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
mental retardation, language problems.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Instead, our EEG scans revealed

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
very specific problems hidden within their brains

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
that couldn't possibly have been detected

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
by their behavioral assessments.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
So these EEG scans

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
enabled us to provide these children

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
with a much more accurate neurological diagnosis

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
and much more targeted treatment.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
For too long now, children with developmental disorders

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
have suffered from misdiagnosis

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
while their real problems have gone undetected

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
and left to worsen.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
And for too long, these children and their parents

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
have suffered undue frustration and desperation.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
But we are now in a new era of neuroscience,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
one in which we can finally look

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
directly at brain function in real time

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
with no risks and no side effects, non-invasively,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
and find the true source

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
of so many disabilities in children.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
So if I could inspire

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
even a fraction of you in the audience today

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
to share this pioneering diagnostic approach

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
with even one parent whose child

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
is suffering from a developmental disorder,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
then perhaps one more puzzle

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
in one more brain will be solved.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
One more mind will be unlocked.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
And one more child who has been misdiagnosed

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
or even undiagnosed by the system

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
will finally realize his or her true potential

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
while there's still time

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
for his or her brain to recover.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And all this by simply watching the child's brainwaves.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Thank you.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
(Applause)
