00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So, these are

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
the Dark Ages.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And the Dark Ages are the time between

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
when you put away the LEGO

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
for the last time as a kid,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and you decide as an adult that it is okay to play with a kid's toy.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Started out with my then four-year-old:

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
"Oh, should buy the kid some LEGO.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
That stuff's cool."

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Walked into the LEGO store.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Bought him this.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
It's totally appropriate for a four-year-old.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
(Laughter)

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I think the box says --

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
let's see here --

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
"8 to 12" on it.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I turn to my wife and said, "Who are we buying this for?"

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
She's like, "Oh, us." I'm like, "Okay. All right. That's cool."

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Pretty soon it got a little bit out of control.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The dining room looked like this.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
You walk there, and it hurts.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
So we took a room downstairs in the basement

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
that had been used as sort of an Abu Ghraib annex.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
(Laughter)

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Torture, very funny.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Wow, you guys are great.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And we put down those little floor tiles,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and then I went onto eBay

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and bought 150 pounds of LEGO --

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
(Laughter)

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
which is insane.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
My daughter -- the day we got it, I was tucking her in --

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and I said,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
"Honey, you're my treasure."

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And she said, "No, the LEGO is the treasure."

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
(Laughter)

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And then she said, "Dad, we're LEGO rich."

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I was like, "Yeah.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I suppose we are."

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
So then once you do that

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
you're like, "Oh, crap. Where am I going to put all this?"

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
So you go to The Container Store

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and spend an enormous amount of money,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and then you start this crazy sorting process

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
that never --

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
it's just nuts.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Whatever.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
So then you realize there are these conventions.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And you go to one of these conventions, and some dude built the Titanic.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And you're like, "Holy shit!

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
He had to come in like a truck,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
a semi, with this thing."

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And then someone built this -- this is the Smith Tower in Seattle.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Just beautiful.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And there's a dude selling these

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
aftermarket weapons for LEGO,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
because LEGO -- the Danish --

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
no, they're not into guns.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
But the Americans? Oh, we'll make some guns for LEGO, no problem.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And at a certain point, you look around,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
you're like, "Whoa, this is a really nerdy crowd."

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And I mean like this is a nerdy crowd,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
but that's like a couple of levels above furries.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
(Laughter)

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
The nerds here, they get laid --

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
except for the lady with the condoms in her pocket --

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and you say to yourself at some point,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
"Am I part of this group? Like, am I into this?"

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And I was just like, "Yeah, I guess I am.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I'm coming out.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
I'm kind of into this stuff, and I'm going to stop being embarrassed."

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
So then you really get into it,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
and you're like, "Well, the LEGO people in Denmark, they've got all this software

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
to let you build your own virtually."

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And so this is like this CAD program where you build it.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
And then whatever you design virtually,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
you click the button and it shows up at your doorstep a week later.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
And then some of the designs that people do

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
they actually sell in the store.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
The LEGO guys don't give you any royalties, strangely,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
but some user made this and then it sold.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And it's pretty amazing actually.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Then you notice that if that

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
LEGO-provided CAD program isn't enough,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
there's an entire open-source, third-party,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
independent LEGO CAD program

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
that lets you do 3D modeling

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
and 3D rendering

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
and make, in fact, movies out of LEGO,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
3D films

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
of which there are thousands on YouTube,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
and some of them sort of mimicking famous films

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and some totally original content --

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
just beautiful --

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
and people recreating all sorts of things.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
I have to take a moment.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
I love the guy who's like running away

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
with his clasps, his hooks.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Okay. Anyway.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
(Laughter)

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
There's a whole programming language and robotics tool,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
so if you want to teach someone how to program,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
kid, adult, whatever it is.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And the guy that made this,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
he made a slot machine out of LEGO.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
And I don't mean he made LEGO that looked like a slot machine;

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
I mean he made a slot machine out of LEGO.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
The insides were LEGO.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
There's people getting drunk building LEGO,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
and you've got to finish the thing before you puke.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
There's a whole gray market for LEGO,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
thousands of home-based businesses.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
And some people will fund their entire LEGO habit

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
by selling the little guy,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
but then you have no guys in your ships.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And then, just some examples. This stuff really is sculpture.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
This is amazing what you can do.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
And don't kid yourself:

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
some architectural details, incredible organic shapes

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
and just, even, nature out of, again, little blocks.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
This is my house.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
And this is my house.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
I was afraid a car was going to come smash it

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
as I was taking a picture for you guys.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Anyway, I'm out of time.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
But just very quickly --

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
we'll just see if I can do this quick.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Because there aren't enough TED logos around here.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
(Laughter)

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Let's see here.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Okay.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Ta-da.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
(Applause)
