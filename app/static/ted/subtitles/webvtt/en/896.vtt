00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The story starts in Kenya

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
in December of 2007,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
when there was a disputed presidential election,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and in the immediate aftermath of that election,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
there was an outbreak of ethnic violence.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And there was a lawyer in Nairobi, Ory Okolloh --

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
who some of you may know from her TEDTalk --

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
who began blogging about it on her site,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Kenyan Pundit.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And shortly after the election and the outbreak of violence,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
the government suddenly imposed

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
a significant media blackout.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And so weblogs went from being

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
commentary as part of the media landscape

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
to being a critical part of the media landscape

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
in trying to understand where the violence was.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And Okolloh solicited

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
from her commenters

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
more information about what was going on.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The comments began pouring in,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and Okolloh would collate them. She would post them.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And she quickly said, "It's too much.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I could do this all day every day

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and I can't keep up.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
There is more information

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
about what's going on in Kenya right now

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
than any one person can manage.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
If only there was a way to automate this."

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And two programmers who read her blog

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
held their hands up and said, "We could do that,"

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and in 72 hours, they launched Ushahidi.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Ushahidi -- the name means "witness"

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
or "testimony" in Swahili --

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
is a very simple way of taking reports from the field,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
whether it's from the web or, critically,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
via mobile phones and SMS,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
aggregating it and putting it on a map.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
That's all it is, but that's all that's needed

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
because what it does is it takes the tacit information

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
available to the whole population --

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
everybody knows where the violence is,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
but no one person knows what everyone knows --

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and it takes that tacit information

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and it aggregates it,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and it maps it and it makes it public.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
And that, that maneuver

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
called "crisis mapping,"

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
was kicked off in Kenya

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
in January of 2008.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And enough people looked at it and found it valuable enough

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
that the programmers who created Ushahidi

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
decided they were going to make it open source

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and turn it into a platform.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
It's since been deployed in Mexico

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
to track electoral fraud.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
It's been deployed in Washington D.C. to track snow cleanup.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And it's been used most famously in Haiti

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
in the aftermath of the earthquake.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And when you look at the map

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
now posted on the Ushahidi front page,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
you can see that the number of deployments in Ushahidi

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
has gone worldwide, all right?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
This went from a single idea

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and a single implementation

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
in East Africa in the beginning of 2008

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
to a global deployment

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
in less than three years.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Now what Okolloh did

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
would not have been possible

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
without digital technology.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
What Okolloh did would not have been possible

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
without human generosity.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And the interesting moment now,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
the number of environments

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
where the social design challenge

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
relies on both of those things being true.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
That is the resource that I'm talking about.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I call it cognitive surplus.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And it represents the ability

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
of the world's population

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
to volunteer and to contribute and collaborate

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
on large, sometimes global, projects.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Cognitive surplus is made up of two things.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
The first, obviously, is the world's free time and talents.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
The world has over

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
a trillion hours a year

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
of free time

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
to commit to shared projects.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Now, that free time existed in the 20th century,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
but we didn't get Ushahidi in the 20th century.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
That's the second half of cognitive surplus.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
The media landscape in the 20th century

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
was very good at helping people consume,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and we got, as a result,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
very good at consuming.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
But now that we've been given media tools --

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
the Internet, mobile phones -- that let us do more than consume,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
what we're seeing is that people weren't couch potatoes

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
because we liked to be.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
We were couch potatoes because that was

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
the only opportunity given to us.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
We still like to consume, of course.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
But it turns out we also like to create,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and we like to share.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And it's those two things together --

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
ancient human motivation

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
and the modern tools to allow that motivation

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
to be joined up in large-scale efforts --

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
that are the new design resource.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
And using cognitive surplus,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
we're starting to see truly incredible experiments

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
in scientific, literary,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
artistic, political efforts.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Designing.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
We're also getting, of course, a lot of LOLcats.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
LOLcats are cute pictures of cats

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
made cuter with the addition of cute captions.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And they are also

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
part of the abundant media landscape we're getting now.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
This is one of the participatory --

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
one of the participatory models

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
we see coming out of that, along with Ushahidi.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Now I want to stipulate, as the lawyers say,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
that LOLcats are the stupidest possible

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
creative act.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
There are other candidates of course,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
but LOLcats will do as a general case.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
But here's the thing:

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
The stupidest possible creative act

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
is still a creative act.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Someone who has done something like this,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
however mediocre and throwaway,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
has tried something, has put something forward in public.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
And once they've done it, they can do it again,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
and they could work on getting it better.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
There is a spectrum between mediocre work and good work,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
and as anybody who's worked as an artist or a creator knows,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
it's a spectrum you're constantly

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
struggling to get on top of.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
The gap is between

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
doing anything and doing nothing.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And someone who makes a LOLcat

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
has already crossed over that gap.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Now it's tempting to want to get the Ushahidis

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
without the LOLcats, right,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
to get the serious stuff without the throwaway stuff.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
But media abundance never works that way.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Freedom to experiment means freedom to experiment with anything.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Even with the sacred printing press,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
we got erotic novels 150 years

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
before we got scientific journals.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
So before I talk about

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
what is, I think, the critical difference

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
between LOLcats and Ushahidi,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
I want to talk about

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
their shared source.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And that source is design for generosity.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
It is one of the curiosities of our historical era

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
that even as cognitive surplus

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
is becoming a resource we can design around,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
social sciences are also starting to explain

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
how important

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
our intrinsic motivations are to us,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
how much we do things because we like to do them

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
rather than because our boss told us to do them,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
or because we're being paid to do them.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
This is a graph from a paper

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
by Uri Gneezy and Aldo Rustichini,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
who set out to test, at the beginning of this decade,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
what they called "deterrence theory."

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And deterrence theory is a very simple theory of human behavior:

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
If you want somebody to do less of something,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
add a punishment and they'll do less of it.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Simple, straightforward, commonsensical --

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
also, largely untested.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
And so they went and studied

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
10 daycare centers in Haifa, Israel.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
They studied those daycare centers

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
at the time of highest tension,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
which is pick-up time.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
At pick-up time the teachers,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
who have been with your children all day,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
would like you to be there at the appointed hour to take your children back.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Meanwhile, the parents -- perhaps a little busy at work, running late, running errands --

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
want a little slack to pick the kids up late.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
So Gneezy and Rustichini said,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
"How many instances of late pick-ups

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
are there at these 10 daycare centers?"

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Now they saw -- and this is what the graph is,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
these are the number of weeks and these are the number of late arrivals --

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
that there were between six and 10

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
instances of late pick-ups

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
on average in these 10 daycare centers.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
So they divided the daycare centers into two groups.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
The white group there

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
is the control group; they change nothing.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
But the group of daycare centers represented by the black line,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
they said, "We are changing this bargain

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
as of right now.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
If you pick your kid up more than 10 minutes late,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
we're going to add a 10 shekel fine to your bill.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Boom. No ifs, ands or buts."

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
And the minute they did that,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
the behavior in those daycare centers changed.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Late pick-ups went up

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
every week for the next four weeks

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
until they topped out at triple the pre-fine average,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
and then they fluctuated

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
at between double and triple the pre-fine average

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
for the life of the fine.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
And you can see immediately what happened, right?

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
The fine broke the culture

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
of the daycare center.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
By adding a fine,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
what they did was communicate to the parents

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
that their entire debt to the teachers

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
had been discharged

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
with the payment of 10 shekels,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
and that there was no residue of guilt or social concern

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
that the parents owed the teachers.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
And so the parents, quite sensibly, said,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
"10 shekels to pick my kid up late?

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
What could be bad?"

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
(Laughter)

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
The explanation of human behavior

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
that we inherited in the 20th century

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
was that we are all rational, self-maximizing actors,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
and in that explanation --

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
the daycare center had no contract --

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
should have been operating without any constraints.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
But that's not right.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
They were operating with social constraints

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
rather than contractual ones.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
And critically, the social constraints

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
created a culture that was more generous

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
than the contractual constraints did.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
So Gneezy and Rustichini run this experiment for a dozen weeks --

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
run the fine for a dozen weeks --

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
and then they say, "Okay, that's it. All done; fine."

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
And then a really interesting thing happens:

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Nothing changes.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
The culture that got broken by the fine

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
stayed broken when the fine was removed.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Not only are economic motivations

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
and intrinsic motivations

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
incompatible,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
that incompatibility

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
can persist over long periods.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
So the trick

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
in designing these kinds of situations

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
is to understand where you're relying on

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
the economic part of the bargain -- as with the parents paying the teachers --

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
and when you're relying on the social part of the bargain,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
when you're really designing for generosity.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
This brings me back to the LOLcats

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
and to Ushahidi.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
This is, I think, the range that matters.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Both of these rely on cognitive surplus.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Both of these design for the assumption

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
that people like to create and we want to share.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Here is the critical difference between these:

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
LOLcats is communal value.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
It's value created by the participants

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
for each other.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Communal value on the networks we have

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
is everywhere --

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
every time you see a large aggregate

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
of shared, publicly available data,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
whether it's photos on Flickr

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
or videos on Youtube or whatever.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
This is good. I like LOLcats as much as the next guy,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
maybe a little more even,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
but this is also

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
a largely solved problem.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
I have a hard time envisioning a future

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
in which someone is saying,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
"Where, oh where, can I find a picture

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
of a cute cat?"

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Ushahidi, by contrast,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
is civic value.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
It's value created by the participants

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
but enjoyed by society as a whole.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
The goals set out by Ushahidi

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
are not just to make life better

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
for the participants,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
but to make life better for everyone in the society

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
in which Ushahidi is operating.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
And that kind of civic value

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
is not just a side effect

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
of opening up to human motivation.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
It really is going to be a side effect

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
of what we, collectively,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
make of these kinds of efforts.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
There are a trillion

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
hours a year

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
of participatory value

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
up for grabs.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
That will be true year-in and year-out.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
The number of people who are going to be able

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
to participate in these kinds of projects

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
is going to grow,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
and we can see that organizations

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
designed around a culture of generosity

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
can achieve incredible effects

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
without an enormous amount of contractual overhead --

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
a very different model

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
than our default model for large-scale group action in the 20th century.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
What's going to make the difference here

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
is what Dean Kamen said,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
the inventor and entrepreneur.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Kamen said, "Free cultures get what they celebrate."

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
We've got a choice before us.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
We've got this trillion hours a year.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
We can use it to crack each other up, and we're going to do that.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
That, we get for free.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
But we can also celebrate

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
and support and reward the people

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
trying to use cognitive surplus

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
to create civic value.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
And to the degree we're going to do that, to the degree we're able to do that,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
we'll be able to change society.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Thank you very much.
