WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In the last 50 years,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
we've been building the suburbs

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
with a lot of unintended consequences.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And I'm going to talk about some of those consequences

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and just present a whole bunch of really interesting projects

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that I think give us tremendous reasons

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
to be really optimistic

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
that the big design and development project of the next 50 years

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
is going to be retrofitting suburbia.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So whether it's redeveloping dying malls

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
or re-inhabiting dead big-box stores

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
or reconstructing wetlands

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
out of parking lots,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I think the fact is

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
the growing number

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
of empty and under-performing,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
especially retail, sites

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
throughout suburbia

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
gives us actually a tremendous opportunity

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
to take our least-sustainable

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
landscapes right now

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and convert them into

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
more sustainable places.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And in the process, what that allows us to do

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
is to redirect a lot more of our growth

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
back into existing communities

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
that could use a boost,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and have the infrastructure in place,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
instead of continuing

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
to tear down trees

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and to tear up the green space out at the edges.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So why is this important?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I think there are any number of reasons,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and I'm just going to not get into detail but mention a few.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Just from the perspective of climate change,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
the average urban dweller in the U.S.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
has about one-third the carbon footprint

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
of the average suburban dweller,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
mostly because suburbanites drive a lot more,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and living in detached buildings,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
you have that much more exterior surface

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
to leak energy out of.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
So strictly from

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
a climate change perspective,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
the cities are already

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
relatively green.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
The big opportunity

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
is actually in urbanizing

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
the suburbs.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
All that driving that we've been doing out in the suburbs,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
we have doubled the amount of miles we drive.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
It's increased our dependence

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
on foreign oil

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
despite the gains in fuel efficiency.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
We're just driving so much more;

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
we haven't been able to keep up technologically.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Public health is another reason

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
to consider retrofitting.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Researchers at the CDC and other places

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
have increasingly been linking

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
suburban development patterns

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
with sedentary lifestyles.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And those have been linked then

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
with the rather alarming,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
growing rates of obesity,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
shown in these maps here,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and that obesity has also been triggering

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
great increases in heart disease

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and diabetes

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
to the point where a child born today

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
has a one-in-three chance

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
of developing diabetes.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And that rate has been escalating at the same rate

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
as children not walking

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
to school anymore,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
again, because of our development patterns.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And then there's finally -- there's the affordability question.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I mean, how affordable is it

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
to continue to live in suburbia

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
with rising gas prices?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Suburban expansion to cheap land,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
for the last 50 years --

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
you know the cheap land out on the edge --

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
has helped generations of families

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
enjoy the American dream.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
But increasingly,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
the savings promised

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
by drive-till-you-qualify affordability --

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
which is basically our model --

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
those savings are wiped out

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
when you consider the transportation costs.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
For instance, here in Atlanta,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
about half of households

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
make between $20,000 and $50,000 a year,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and they are spending 29 percent of their income

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
on housing

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and 32 percent

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
on transportation.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
I mean, that's 2005 figures.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
That's before we got up to the four bucks a gallon.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
You know, none of us

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
really tend to do the math on our transportation costs,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
and they're not going down

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
any time soon.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Whether you love suburbia's leafy privacy

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
or you hate its soulless commercial strips,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
there are reasons why it's important to retrofit.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
But is it practical?

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
I think it is.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
June Williamson and I have been researching this topic

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
for over a decade,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
and we've found over 80

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
varied projects.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
But that they're really all market driven,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
and what's driving the market in particular --

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
number one -- is major demographic shifts.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
We all tend to think of suburbia

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
as this very family-focused place,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
but that's really not the case anymore.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Since 2000,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
already two-thirds of households in suburbia

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
did not have kids in them.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
We just haven't caught up with the actual realities of this.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
The reasons for this have a lot to with

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
the dominance of the two big

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
demographic groups right now:

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
the Baby Boomers retiring --

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
and then there's a gap,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Generation X, which is a small generation.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
They're still having kids --

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
but Generation Y hasn't even started

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
hitting child-rearing age.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
They're the other big generation.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
So as a result of that,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
demographers predict

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
that through 2025,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
75 to 85 percent of new households

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
will not have kids in them.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And the market research, consumer research,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
asking the Boomers and Gen Y

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
what it is they would like,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
what they would like to live in,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
tells us there is going to be a huge demand --

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
and we're already seeing it --

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
for more urban lifestyles

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
within suburbia.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
That basically, the Boomers want to be able to age in place,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
and Gen Y would like to live

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
an urban lifestyle,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
but most of their jobs will continue to be out in suburbia.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
The other big dynamic of change

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
is the sheer performance of

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
underperforming asphalt.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Now I keep thinking this would be a great name

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
for an indie rock band,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
but developers generally use it

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
to refer to underused parking lots --

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
and suburbia is full of them.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
When the postwar suburbs were first built

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
out on the cheap land

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
away from downtown,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
it made sense to just build

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
surface parking lots.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
But those sites have now been leapfrogged

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
and leapfrogged again,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
as we've just continued to sprawl,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and they now have

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
a relatively central location.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
It no longer just makes sense.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
That land is more valuable than just surface parking lots.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
It now makes sense to go back in,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
build a deck and build up

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
on those sites.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
So what do you do

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
with a dead mall,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
dead office park?

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
It turns out, all sorts of things.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
In a slow economy like ours,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
re-inhabitation is

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
one of the more popular strategies.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
So this happens to be

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
a dead mall in St. Louis

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
that's been re-inhabited as art-space.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
It's now home to artist studios,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
theater groups, dance troupes.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
It's not pulling in as much tax revenue

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
as it once was,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
but it's serving its community.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
It's keeping the lights on.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
It's becoming, I think, a really great institution.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Other malls have been re-inhabited

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
as nursing homes,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
as universities,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
and as all variety of office space.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
We also found a lot of examples

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
of dead big-box stores

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
that have been converted into

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
all sorts of community-serving uses as well --

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
lots of schools, lots of churches

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
and lots of libraries like this one.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
This was a little grocery store, a Food Lion grocery store,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
that is now a public library.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
In addition to, I think, doing a beautiful adaptive reuse,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
they tore up some of the parking spaces,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
put in bioswales to collect and clean the runoff,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
put in a lot more sidewalks

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
to connect to the neighborhoods.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
And they've made this,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
what was just a store along a commercial strip,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
into a community gathering space.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
This one is a little L-shaped strip shopping center

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
in Phoenix, Arizona.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Really all they did was they gave it a fresh coat of bright paint,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
a gourmet grocery,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
and they put up a restaurant in the old post office.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Never underestimate the power of food

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
to turn a place around

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
and make it a destination.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
It's been so successful, they've now taken over the strip across the street.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
The real estate ads in the neighborhood

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
all very proudly proclaim,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
"Walking distance to Le Grande Orange,"

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
because it provided its neighborhood

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
with what sociologists like to call

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
"a third place."

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
If home is the first place

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
and work is the second place,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
the third place is where you go to hang out

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
and build community.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
And especially as suburbia is becoming

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
less centered on the family,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
the family households,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
there's a real hunger

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
for more third places.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
So the most dramatic retrofits

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
are really those in the next category,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
the next strategy: redevelopment.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Now, during the boom, there were several

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
really dramatic redevelopment projects

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
where the original building

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
was scraped to the ground and then the whole site was rebuilt

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
at significantly greater density,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
a sort of compact, walkable urban neighborhoods.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
But some of them have been much more incremental.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
This is Mashpee Commons,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
the oldest retrofit that we've found.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
And it's just incrementally, over the last 20 years,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
built urbanism

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
on top of its parking lots.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
So the black and white photo shows

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
the simple 60's strip shopping center.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
And then the maps above that

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
show its gradual transformation

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
into a compact,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
mixed-use New England village,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
and it has plans now that have been approved

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
for it to connect

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
to new residential neighborhoods

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
across the arterials

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
and over to the other side.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
So, you know, sometimes it's incremental.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Sometimes, it's all at once.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
This is another infill project on the parking lots,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
this one of an office park outside of Washington D.C.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
When Metrorail expanded transit into the suburbs

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
and opened a station nearby to this site,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
the owners decided

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
to build a new parking deck

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
and then insert on top of their surface lots

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
a new Main Street, several apartments

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
and condo buildings,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
while keeping the existing office buildings.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Here is the site in 1940:

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
It was just a little farm

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
in the village of Hyattsville.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
By 1980, it had been subdivided

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
into a big mall on one side

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
and the office park on the other

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
and then some buffer sites for a library

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
and a church to the far right.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Today, the transit,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
the Main Street and the new housing

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
have all been built.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Eventually, I expect that the streets

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
will probably extend through a redevelopment of the mall.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Plans have already been announced

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
for a lot of those garden apartments

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
above the mall to be redeveloped.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Transit is a big driver of retrofits.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
So here's what it looks like.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
You can sort of see the funky new condo buildings

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
in between the office buildings

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
and the public space and the new Main Street.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
This one is one of my favorites, Belmar.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
I think they really built an attractive place here

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
and have just employed all-green construction.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
There's massive P.V. arrays on the roofs

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
as well as wind turbines.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
This was a very large mall

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
on a hundred-acre superblock.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
It's now 22

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
walkable urban blocks

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
with public streets,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
two public parks, eight bus lines

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
and a range of housing types,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
and so it's really given Lakewood, Colorado

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
the downtown

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
that this particular suburb never had.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Here was the mall in its heyday.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
They had their prom in the mall. They loved their mall.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
So here's the site in 1975

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
with the mall.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
By 1995, the mall has died.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
The department store has been kept --

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
and we found this was true in many cases.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
The department stores are multistory; they're better built.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
They're easy to be re-adapted.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
But the one story stuff ...

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
that's really history.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
So here it is at projected build-out.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
This project, I think, has great connectivity

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
to the existing neighborhoods.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
It's providing 1,500 households with the option

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
of a more urban lifestyle.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
It's about two-thirds built out right now.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Here's what the new Main Street looks like.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
It's very successful,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
and it's helped to prompt --

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
eight of the 13

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
regional malls in Denver

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
have now, or have announced plans to

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
be, retrofitted.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
But it's important to note that all of this retrofitting

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
is not occurring --

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
just bulldozers are coming and just plowing down the whole city.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
No, it's pockets of walkability

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
on the sites of

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
under-performing properties.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
And so it's giving people more choices,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
but it's not taking away choices.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
But it's also not really enough

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
to just create pockets of walkability.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
You want to also try to get more systemic transformation.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
We need to also retrofit the corridors themselves.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
So this is one that has been

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
retrofitted in California.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
They took the commercial strip

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
shown on the black-and-white images below,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
and they built a boulevard

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
that has become the Main Street for their town.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
And it's transformed from being

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
an ugly, unsafe,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
undesirable address,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
to becoming a beautiful,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
attractive, dignified sort of good address.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
I mean now we're hoping we start to see it;

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
they've already built City Hall, attracted two hotels.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
I could imagine beautiful housing going up along there

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
without tearing down another tree.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
So there's a lot of great things,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
but I'd love to see more corridors getting retrofitting.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
But densification

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
is not going to work everywhere.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Sometimes re-greening

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
is really the better answer.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
There's a lot to learn from successful

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
landbanking programs

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
in cities like Flint, Michigan.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
There's also a burgeoning suburban farming movement --

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
sort of victory gardens meets the Internet.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
But perhaps one of the most important re-greening aspects

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
is the opportunity to restore

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
the local ecology,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
as in this example outside of Minneapolis.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
When the shopping center died,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
the city restored the site's

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
original wetlands,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
creating lakefront property,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
which then attracted private investment,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
the first private investment to this very low-income neighborhood

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
in over 40 years.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
So they've managed to both restore the local ecology

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
and the local economy at the same time.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
This is another re-greening example.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
It also makes sense in very strong markets.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
This one in Seattle

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
is on the site of a mall parking lot

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
adjacent to a new transit stop.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
And the wavy line

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
is a path alongside a creek that has now been daylit.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
The creek had been culverted under the parking lot.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
But daylighting our creeks

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
really improves their water quality

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
and contributions to habitat.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
So I've shown you some of

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
the first generation of retrofits.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
What's next?

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
I think we have three challenges for the future.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
The first is to plan retrofitting

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
much more systemically

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
at the metropolitan scale.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
We need to be able to target

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
which areas really should be re-greened.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Where should we be redeveloping?

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
And where should we be encouraging re-inhabitation?

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
These slides just show two images

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
from a larger project

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
that looked at trying to do that for Atlanta.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
I led a team that was asked to imagine

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Atlanta 100 years from now.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
And we chose to try to reverse sprawl

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
through three simple moves -- expensive, but simple.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
One, in a hundred years,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
transit on all major

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
rail and road corridors.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Two, in a hundred years,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
thousand foot buffers

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
on all stream corridors.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
It's a little extreme, but we've got a little water problem.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
In a hundred years,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
subdivisions that simply end up too close to water

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
or too far from transit won't be viable.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
And so we've created the eco-acre

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
transfer-to-transfer development rights

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
to the transit corridors

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
and allow the re-greening

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
of those former subdivisions

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
for food and energy production.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
So the second challenge

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
is to improve the architectural design quality

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
of the retrofits.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
And I close with this image

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
of democracy in action:

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
This is a protest that's happening

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
on a retrofit in Silver Spring, Maryland

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
on an Astroturf town green.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Now, retrofits are often accused

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
of being examples of faux downtowns

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
and instant urbanism,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
and not without reason; you don't get much more phony

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
than an Astroturf town green.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
I have to say, these are very hybrid places.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
They are new but trying to look old.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
They have urban streetscapes,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
but suburban parking ratios.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Their populations are

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
more diverse than typical suburbia,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
but they're less diverse than cities.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
And they are

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
public places,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
but that are managed by private companies.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
And just the surface appearance

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
are often -- like the Astroturf here --

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
they make me wince.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
So, you know, I mean I'm glad that

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
the urbanism is doing its job.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
The fact that a protest is happening

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
really does mean

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
that the layout of the blocks, the streets and blocks, the putting in of public space,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
compromised as it may be,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
is still a really great thing.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
But we've got to get the architecture better.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
The final challenge is for all of you.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
I want you to join the protest

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
and start demanding

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
more sustainable suburban places --

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
more sustainable places, period.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
But culturally,

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
we tend to think that downtowns

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
should be dynamic, and we expect that.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
But we seem to have an expectation

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
that the suburbs should forever remain frozen

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
in whatever adolescent form

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
they were first given birth to.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
It's time to let them grow up,

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
so I want you

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
to all support the zoning changes,

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
the road diets, the infrastructure improvements

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
and the retrofits that are coming soon to a neighborhood near you.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
Thank you.
