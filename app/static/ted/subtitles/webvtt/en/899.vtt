00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
It can be a very complicated thing, the ocean.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
And it can be a very complicated thing, what human health is.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And bringing those two together might seem a very daunting task,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
but what I'm going to try to say is that

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
even in that complexity,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
there's some simple themes that I think,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
if we understand, we can really move forward.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And those simple themes aren't really

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
themes about the complex science of what's going on,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
but things that we all pretty well know.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And I'm going to start with this one:

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
If momma ain't happy, ain't nobody happy.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We know that, right? We've experienced that.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And if we just take that

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and we build from there,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
then we can go to the next step,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
which is that if the ocean ain't happy,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
ain't nobody happy.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
That's the theme of my talk.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And we're making the ocean pretty unhappy in a lot of different ways.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
This is a shot of Cannery Row in 1932.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Cannery Row, at the time,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
had the biggest industrial

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
canning operation on the west coast.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
We piled enormous amounts of pollution

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
into the air and into the water.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Rolf Bolin, who was a professor

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
at the Hopkin's Marine Station where I work,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
wrote in the 1940s that

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
"The fumes from the scum floating on the inlets of the bay

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
were so bad they turned

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
lead-based paints black."

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
People working in these canneries

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
could barely stay there all day because of the smell,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
but you know what they came out saying?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
They say, "You know what you smell?

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
You smell money."

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
That pollution was money to that community,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and those people dealt with the pollution

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and absorbed it into their skin and into their bodies

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
because they needed the money.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
We made the ocean unhappy; we made people very unhappy,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and we made them unhealthy.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
The connection between ocean health and human health

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
is actually based upon another couple simple adages,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and I want to call that

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
"pinch a minnow, hurt a whale."

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
The pyramid of ocean life ...

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Now, when an ecologist looks at the ocean -- I have to tell you --

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
we look at the ocean in a very different way,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and we see different things than when a regular person looks at the ocean

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
because when an ecologist looks at the ocean,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
we see all those interconnections.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
We see the base of the food chain,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
the plankton, the small things,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and we see how those animals

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
are food to animals in the middle of the pyramid,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and on so up this diagram.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And that flow, that flow of life,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
from the very base up to the very top,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
is the flow that ecologists see.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
And that's what we're trying to preserve

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
when we say, "Save the ocean. Heal the ocean."

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
It's that pyramid.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Now why does that matter for human health?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Because when we jam things in the bottom

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
of that pyramid that shouldn't be there,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
some very frightening things happen.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Pollutants, some pollutants have been created by us:

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
molecules like PCBs

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
that can't be broken down by our bodies.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And they go in the base of that pyramid,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and they drift up; they're passed up that way,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
on to predators and on to the top predators,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and in so doing,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
they accumulate.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Now, to bring that home, I thought I'd invent a little game.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
We don't really have to play it; we can just think about it here.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
It's the Styrofoam and chocolate game.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Imagine that when we got on this boat,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
we were all given

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
two Styrofoam peanuts.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Can't do much with them: Put them in your pocket.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Suppose the rules are: every time you offer somebody a drink,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
you give them the drink,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
and you give them your Styrofoam peanuts too.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
What'll happen is that the Styrofoam peanuts

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
will start moving through our society here,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
and they will accumulate in

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
the drunkest, stingiest people.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
(Laughter)

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
There's no mechanism in this game

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
for them to go anywhere but into

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
a bigger and bigger pile

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
of indigestible Styrofoam peanuts.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And that's exactly what happens with PDBs

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
in this food pyramid:

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
They accumulate into the top of it.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Now suppose, instead of Styrofoam peanuts,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
we take these lovely little chocolates that we get

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and we had those instead.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Well, some of us would be eating those chocolates

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
instead of passing them around,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
and instead of accumulating,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
they will just pass into our group here

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and not accumulate in any one group

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
because they're absorbed by us.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And that's the difference between a PCB

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
and, say, something natural like an omega-3,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
something we want out of the marine food chain.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
PCBs accumulate.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
We have great examples of that, unfortunately.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
PCBs accumulate in dolphins

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
in Sarasota Bay, in Texas, in North Carolina.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
They get into the food chain.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
The dolphins eat the fish

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
that have PCBs from the plankton,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
and those PCBs, being fat-soluble,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
accumulate in these dolphins.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Now, a dolphin,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
mother dolphin, any dolphin --

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
there's only one way

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
that a PCB can get out of a dolphin.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
And what's that?

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
In mother's milk.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Here's a diagram of the PCB load

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
of dolphins in Sarasota Bay.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Adult males: a huge load.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Juveniles: a huge load.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Females after their first calf is already weaned:

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
a lower load.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Those females, they're not trying to.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Those females are passing the PCBs

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
in the fat of their own mother's milk

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
into their offspring,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and their offspring don't survive.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
The death rate in these dolphins,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
for the first calf born of every female dolphin,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
is 60 to 80 percent.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
These mothers pump their first offspring

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
full of this pollutant,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
and most of them die.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Now, the mother then can go and reproduce,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
but what a terrible price to pay

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
for the accumulation of this pollutant

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
in these animals --

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
the death of the first-born calf.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
There's another top predator in the ocean, it turns out.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
That top predator, of course, is us.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
And we also are eating meat

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
that comes from some of these same places.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
This is whale meat

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
that I photographed in a grocery store in Tokyo --

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
or is it?

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
In fact, what we did a few years ago

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
was learn how to smuggle

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
a molecular biology lab into Tokyo

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
and use it to genetically test the DNA

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
out of whale meat samples

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
and identify what they really were.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
And some of those whale meat samples were whale meat.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Some of them were illegal whale meat, by the way.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
That's another story.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
But some of them were not whale meat at all.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Even though they were labeled whale meat, they were dolphin meat.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Some of them were dolphin liver. Some of them were dolphin blubber.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And those dolphin parts

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
had a huge load of PCBs,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
dioxins and heavy metals.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
And that huge load was passing into the people

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
that ate this meat.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
It turns out that a lot of dolphins

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
are being sold as meat

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
in the whale meat market around the world.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
That's a tragedy for those populations,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
but it's also a tragedy

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
for the people eating them

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
because they don't know that that's toxic meat.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
We had these data a few years ago.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
I remember sitting at my desk

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
being about the only person in the world

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
who knew that whale meat being sold in these markets

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
was really dolphin meat, and it was toxic.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
It had two-to-three-to-400 times the toxic loads

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
ever allowed by the EPA.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And I remember there sitting at my desk thinking,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
"Well, I know this. This is a great scientific discovery,"

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
but it was so awful.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
And for the very first time in my scientific career,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
I broke scientific protocol,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
which is that you take the data and publish them in scientific journals

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
and then begin to talk about them.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
We sent a very polite letter

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
to the Minister of Health in Japan

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
and simply pointed out that

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
this is an intolerable situation, not for us,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
but for the people of Japan

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
because mothers who may be breastfeeding,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
who may have young children,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
would be buying something that they thought was healthy,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
but it was really toxic.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
That led to a whole series of other campaigns in Japan,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
and I'm really proud to say that at this point,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
it's very difficult to buy anything in Japan

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
that's labeled incorrectly,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
even though they're still selling whale meat,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
which I believe they shouldn't.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
But at least it's labeled correctly,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
and you're no longer going to be buying

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
toxic dolphin meat instead.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
It isn't just there that this happens,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
but in a natural diet of some communities

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
in the Canadian arctic and in the United States

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
and in the European arctic,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
a natural diet of seals and whales

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
leads to an accumulation of PCBs

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
that have gathered up from all parts of the world

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
and ended up in these women.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
These women have toxic breast milk.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
They cannot feed their offspring, their children,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
their breast milk

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
because of the accumulation of these toxins

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
in their food chain,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
in their part of the world's

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
ocean pyramid.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
That means their immune systems are compromised.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
It means that their children's development

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
can be compromised.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
And the world's attention on this over the last decade

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
has reduced the problem

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
for these women,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
not by changing the pyramid,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
but by changing what they particularly eat out of it.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
We've taken them out of their natural pyramid

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
in order to solve this problem.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
That's a good thing for this particular acute problem,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
but it does nothing to solve the pyramid problem.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
There's other ways of breaking the pyramid.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
The pyramid, if we jam things in the bottom,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
can get backed up like a sewer line that's clogged.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
And if we jam nutrients, sewage, fertilizer

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
in the base of that food pyramid,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
it can back up all through it.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
We end up with things we've heard about before:

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
red tides, for example,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
which are blooms of toxic algae

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
floating through the oceans

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
causing neurological damage.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
We can also see blooms of bacteria,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
blooms of viruses in the ocean.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
These are two shots of a red tide coming on shore here

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
and a bacteria

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
in the genus vibrio,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
which includes the genus that has cholera in it.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
How many people have seen a "beach closed" sign?

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Why does that happen?

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
It happens because we have jammed so much

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
into the base of the natural ocean pyramid

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
that these bacteria clog it up

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
and overfill onto our beaches.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Often what jams us up is sewage.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Now how many of you have ever gone to a state park or a national park

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
where you had a big sign at the front saying,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
"Closed because human sewage

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
is so far over this park

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
that you can't use it"?

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Not very often. We wouldn't tolerate that.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
We wouldn't tolerate our parks

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
being swamped by human sewage,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
but beaches are closed a lot in our country.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
They're closed more and more and more all around the world for the same reason,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
and I believe we shouldn't tolerate that either.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
It's not just a question of cleanliness;

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
it's also a question of

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
how those organisms

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
then turn into human disease.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
These vibrios, these bacteria, can actually infect people.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
They can go into your skin and create skin infections.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
This is a graph from NOAA's ocean and human health initiative,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
showing the rise of the infections

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
by vibrio in people

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
over the last few years.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Surfers, for example, know this incredibly.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
And if you can see on some surfing sites,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
in fact, not only do you see

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
what the waves are like or what the weather's like,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
but on some surf rider sites,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
you see a little flashing poo alert.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
That means that the beach might have great waves,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
but it's a dangerous place for surfers to be

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
because they can carry with them,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
even after a great day of surfing,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
this legacy of an infection that might take a very long time to solve.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Some of these infections are actually carrying

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
antibiotic resistance genes now,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
and that makes them even more difficult.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
These same infections

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
create harmful algal blooms.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Those blooms are generating other kinds of chemicals.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
This is just a simple list of some of the types of poisons

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
that come out of these harmful algal blooms:

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
shellfish poisoning,fish ciguatera,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
diarrheic shellfish poisoning -- you don't want to know about that --

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
neurotoxic shellfish poisoning, paralytic shellfish poisoning.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
These are things that are getting into our food chain

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
because of these blooms.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Rita Calwell very famously

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
traced a very interesting story

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
of cholera into human communities,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
brought there, not by

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
a normal human vector,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
but by a marine vector, this copepod.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Copepods are small crustaceans.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
They're a tiny fraction of an inch long,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
and they can carry on their little legs

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
some of the cholera bacteria

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
that then leads to human disease.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
That has sparked cholera epidemics

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
in ports along the world

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
and has led to increased concentration

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
on trying to make sure shipping

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
doesn't move these

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
vectors of cholera around the world.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
So what do you do?

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
We have major problems in disrupted ecosystem flow

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
that the pyramid may not be working so well,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
that the flow from the base up into it

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
is being blocked and clogged.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
What do you do when you have this sort of disrupted flow?

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Well, there's a bunch of things you could do.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
You could call Joe the Plumber, for example.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
And he could come in

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
and fix the flow.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
But in fact, if you look around the world,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
not only are there hope spots

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
for where we may be able to fix problems,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
there have been places where problems have been fixed,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
where people have come to grips with these issues

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
and begun to turn them around.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Monterey is one of those.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
I started out showing how much

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
we had distressed the Monterey Bay ecosystem

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
with pollution and the canning industry

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
and all of the attendant problems.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
In 1932, that's the picture.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
In 2009, the picture is dramatically different.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
The canneries are gone. The pollution has abated.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
But there's a greater sense here

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
that what the individual communities need

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
is working ecosystems.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
They need a functioning pyramid from the base all the way to the top.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
And that pyramid

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
in Monterey, right now,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
because of the efforts of a lot of different people,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
is functioning better than it's ever functioned

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
for the last 150 years.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
It didn't happen accidentally.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
It happened because many people put their time and effort

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
and their pioneering spirit into this.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
On the left there, Julia Platt,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
the mayor of my little hometown in Pacific Grove.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
At 74 years old, became mayor

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
because something had to be done

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
to protect the ocean.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
In 1931, she produced California's first

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
community-based marine protected area,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
right next to the biggest polluting cannery,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
because Julia knew

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
that when the canneries eventually were gone,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
the ocean needed a place to grow from,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
that the ocean needed a place to spark a seed,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
and she wanted to provide that seed.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Other people, like David Packard and Julie Packard,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
who were instrumental in producing the Monterey Bay aquarium

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
to lock into people's notion

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
that the ocean

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
and the health of the ocean ecosystem

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
were just as important to the economy of this area

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
as eating the ecosystem would be.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
That change in thinking has led to a dramatic shift,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
not only in the fortunes of Monterey Bay,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
but other places around the world.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Well, I want to leave you with the thought that

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
what we're really trying to do here

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
is protect this ocean pyramid,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
and that ocean pyramid

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
connects to our own pyramid of life.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
It's an ocean planet,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
and we think of ourselves as a terrestrial species,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
but the pyramid of life in the ocean

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
and our own lives on land

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
are intricately connected.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
And it's only through having the ocean being healthy

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
that we can remain healthy ourselves.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Thank you very much.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
(Applause)
