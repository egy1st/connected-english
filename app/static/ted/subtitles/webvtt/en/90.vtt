WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This meeting has really been about a digital revolution,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
but I'd like to argue that it's done; we won.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We've had a digital revolution but we don't need to keep having it.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And I'd like to look after that,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
to look what comes after the digital revolution.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So, let me start projecting forward.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
These are some projects I'm involved in today at MIT,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
looking what comes after computers.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
This first one, Internet Zero, up here -- this is a web server

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
that has the cost and complexity of an RFID tag --

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
about a dollar -- that can go in every light bulb and doorknob,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and this is getting commercialized very quickly.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And what's interesting about it isn't the cost;

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
it's the way it encodes the Internet.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It uses a kind of a Morse code for the Internet

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
so you could send it optically; you can communicate acoustically

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
through a power line, through RF.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
It takes the original principle of the Internet,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
which is inter-networking computers,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and now lets devices inter-network.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
That we can take the whole idea that gave birth to the Internet

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and bring it down to the physical world in this Internet Zero,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
this internet of devices.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
So this is the next step from there to here,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and this is getting commercialized today.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
A step after that is a project on fungible computers.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Fungible goods in economics can be extended and traded.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So, half as much grain is half as much useful,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
but half a baby or half a computer is less useful than

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
a whole baby or a whole computer,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and we've been trying to make computers that work that way.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So, what you see in the background is a prototype.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
This was from a thesis of a student, Bill Butow, now at Intel,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
who wondered why, instead of making bigger and bigger chips,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
you don't make small chips, put them in a viscous medium,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and pour out computing by the pound or by the square inch.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And that's what you see here.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
On the left was postscript being rendered by a conventional computer;

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
on the right is postscript being rendered from the first prototype

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
we made, but there's no frame buffer, IO processor,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
any of that stuff -- it's just this material.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Unlike this screen where the dots are placed carefully,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
this is a raw material.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
If you add twice as much of it, you have twice as much display.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
If you shoot a gun through the middle, nothing happens.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
If you need more resource, you just apply more computer.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
So, that's the step after this -- of computing as a raw material.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
That's still conventional bits, the step after that is --

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
this is an earlier prototype in the lab;

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
this is high-speed video slowed down.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Now, integrating chemistry in computation, where the bits are bubbles.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
This is showing making bits, this is showing --

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
once again, slowed down so you can see it,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
bits interacting to do logic and multiplexing and de-multiplexing.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So, now we can compute that the output arranges material

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
as well as information. And, ultimately, these are some slides

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
from an early project I did, computing where the bits are stored

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
quantum-mechanically in the nuclei of atoms, so

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
programs rearrange the nuclear structure of molecules.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
All of these are in the lab pushing further and further and further,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
not as metaphor but literally integrating bits and atoms,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and they lead to the following recognition.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
We all know we've had a digital revolution, but what is that?

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Well, Shannon took us, in the '40s, from here to here:

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
from a telephone being a speaker wire that degraded with distance

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
to the Internet. And he proved the first threshold theorem, that shows

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
if you add information and remove it to a signal,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
you can compute perfectly with an imperfect device.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And that's when we got the Internet.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Von Neumann, in the '50s, did the same thing for computing;

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
he showed you can have an unreliable computer but restore its state

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
to make it perfect. This was the last great analog computer at MIT:

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
a differential analyzer, and the more you ran it,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
the worse the answer got.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
After Von Neumann, we have the Pentium, where the billionth transistor

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
is as reliable as the first one.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
But all our fabrication is down in this lower left corner.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
A state-of-the-art airplane factory rotating metal wax at fixed metal,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
or you maybe melt some plastic. A 10-billion-dollar chip fab

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
uses a process a village artisan would recognize --

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
you spread stuff around and bake it.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
All the intelligence is external to the system;

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
the materials don't have information.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Yesterday you heard about molecular biology,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
which fundamentally computes to build.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
It's an information processing system.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
We've had digital revolutions in communication and computation,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
but precisely the same idea, precisely the same math

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Shannon and Von Neuman did, hasn't yet come out

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
to the physical world. So, inspired by that,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
colleagues in this program -- the Center for Bits and Atoms

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
at MIT -- which is a group of people, like me,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
who never understood the boundary between physical science

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
and computer science. I would even go further and say

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
computer science is one of the worst things that ever happened

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
to either computers or to science --

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000
(Laughter)

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
-- because the canon -- computer science --

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
many of them are great but the canon of computer science

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
prematurely froze a model of computation

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
based on technology that was available in 1950,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
and nature's a much more powerful computer than that.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
So, you'll hear, tomorrow, from Saul Griffith. He was one of the

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
first students to emerge from this program.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
We started to figure out how you can compute to fabricate.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
This was just a proof of principle he did of tiles

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
that interact magnetically, where you write a code,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
much like protein folding, that specifies their structure.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
So, there's no feedback to a tool metrology;

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
the material itself codes for its structure in just the same ways

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
that protein are fabricated. So, you can, for example, do that.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
You can do other things. That's in 2D. It works in 3D.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
The video on the upper right -- I won't show for time --

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
shows self-replication, templating so something can make something

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
that can make something, and we're doing that now over, maybe,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
nine orders of magnitude. Those ideas have been used to show

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
the best fidelity and direct rate DNA to make an organism,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
in functionalizing nanoclusters with peptide tails

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
that code for their assembly -- so, much like the magnets,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
but now on nanometer scales.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Laser micro-machining: essentially 3D printers that digitally fabricate

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
functional systems, all the way up to building buildings,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000
not by having blueprints,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
but having the parts code for the structure of the building.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
So, these are early examples in the lab of emerging technologies

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
to digitize fabrication. Computers that don't control tools

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
but computers that are tools, where the output of a program

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
rearranges atoms as well as bits.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Now, to do that -- with your tax dollars, thank you --

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
I bought all these machines. We made a modest proposal

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
to the NSF. We wanted to be able to make anything on any length scale,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
all in one place, because you can't segregate digital fabrication

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
by a discipline or a length scale.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
So we put together focused nano beam writers

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
and supersonic water jet cutters and excimer micro-machining systems.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
But I had a problem. Once I had all these machines,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
I was spending too much time teaching students to use them.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
So I started teaching a class, modestly called,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
"How To Make Almost Anything." And that wasn't meant to be provocative;

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
it was just for a few research students.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
But the first day of class looked like this.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
You know, hundreds of people came in begging,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
all my life I've been waiting for this class; I'll do anything to do it.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Then they'd ask, can you teach it at MIT? It seems too useful?

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000
And then the next --

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
(Laughter)

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000
-- surprising thing was they weren't there to do research.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
They were there because they wanted to make stuff.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
They had no conventional technical background.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
At the end of a semester they integrated their skills.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
I'll show an old video. Kelly was a sculptor, and this is what she did

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
with her semester project.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
(Video): Kelly: Hi, I'm Kelly and this is my scream buddy.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Do you ever find yourself in a situation

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
where you really have to scream, but you can't because you're at work,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
or you're in a classroom, or you're watching your children,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
or you're in any number of situations where it's just not permitted?

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Well, scream buddy is a portable space for screaming.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
When a user screams into scream buddy, their scream is silenced.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
It is also recorded for later release where, when and how

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000
the user chooses.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
(Scream)

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000
(Laughter) (Applause)

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
So, Einstein would like this.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000
This student made a web browser for parrots --

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
lets parrots surf the Net and talk to other parrots.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
This student's made an alarm clock you wrestle

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
to prove you're awake; this is one that defends --

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
a dress that defends your personal space.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
This isn't technology for communication;

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
it's technology to prevent it.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
This is a device that lets you see your music.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
This is a student who made a machine that makes machines,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
and he made it by making Lego bricks that do the computing.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Just year after year -- and I finally realized

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
the students were showing the killer app of personal fabrication

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
is products for a market of one person.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
You don't need this for what you can get in Wal-Mart;

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000
you need this for what makes you unique.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Ken Olsen famously said, nobody needs a computer in the home.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
But you don't use it for inventory and payroll;

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
DEC is now twice bankrupt. You don't need personal fabrication

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
in the home to buy what you can buy because you can buy it.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
You need it for what makes you unique, just like personalization.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
So, with that, in turn, 20 million dollars today does this;

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
20 years from now we'll make Star Trek replicators that make anything.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
The students hijacked all the machines I bought to do personal fabrication.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Today, when you spend that much of your money,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
there's a government requirement to do outreach, which often means

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
classes at a local school, a website -- stuff that's just not that exciting.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
So, I made a deal with my NSF program managers that

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
instead of talking about it, I'd give people the tools.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
This wasn't meant to be provocative or important,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
but we put together these Fab Labs. It's about 20,000 dollars in equipment

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000
that approximate both what the 20 million dollars does and where it's going.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
A laser cutter to do press-fit assembly with 3D from 2D,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
a sign cutter to plot in copper to do electromagnetics,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
a micron scale,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
numerically-controlled milling machine for precise structures,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
programming tools for less than a dollar,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
100-nanosecond microcontrollers. It lets you work from microns

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000
and microseconds on up, and they exploded around the world.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
This wasn't scheduled, but they went from inner-city Boston

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000
to Pobal in India, to Secondi-Takoradi on Ghana's coast

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
to Soshanguve in a township in South Africa,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
to the far north of Norway, uncovering, or helping uncover,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
for all the attention to the digital divide,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
we would find unused computers in all these places.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
A farmer in a rural village -- a kid needs to measure and modify

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
the world, not just get information about it on a screen.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
That there's really a fabrication and an instrumentation divide

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
bigger than the digital divide.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
And the way you close it is not IT for the masses but IT development for the masses.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
So, in place after place

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
we saw this same progression: that we'd open one of these Fab Labs,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
where we didn't -- this is too crazy to think of.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
We didn't think this up, that we would get pulled to these places;

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
we'd open it. The first step was just empowerment.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
You can see it in their face, just this joy of, I can do it.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
This is a girl in inner-city Boston who had just done a high-tech

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
on-demand craft sale in the inner city community center.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
It goes on from there to serious hands-on technical education

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000
informally, out of schools. In Ghana we had set up one of these labs.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
We designed a network sensor, and kids would show up

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000
and refuse to leave the lab.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
There was a girl who insisted we stay late at night --

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
(Video): Kids: I love the Fab Lab.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
-- her first night in the lab because she was going to make the sensor.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
So she insisted on fabbing the board, learning how to stuff it,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
learning how to program it. She didn't really know

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
what she was doing or why she was doing it, but she knew

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
she just had to do it. There was something electric about it.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
This is late at, you know, 11 o'clock at night

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
and I think I was the only person surprised when what she built

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
worked the first time.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
And I've shown this to engineers at big companies, and they say

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
they can't do this. Any one thing she's doing, they can do better,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
but it's distributed over many people and many sites

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000
and they can't do in an afternoon

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
what this little girl in rural Ghana is doing.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
(Video): Girl: My name is Valentina Kofi; I am eight years old.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
I made a stacking board.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
And, again, that was just for the joy of it.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Then these labs started doing serious problem solving --

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
instrumentation for agriculture in India,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
steam turbines for energy conversion in Ghana,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
high-gain antennas in thin client computers.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000
And then, in turn, businesses started to grow,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000
like making these antennas.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
And finally, the lab started doing invention.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
We're learning more from them than we're giving them.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
I was showing my kids in a Fab Lab how to use it.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
They invented a way to do a construction kit out of a cardboard box --

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
which, as you see up there, that's becoming a business --

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
but their design was better than Saul's design at MIT,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
so there's now three students at MIT doing their theses on

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
scaling the work of eight-year-old children

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000
because they had better designs.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Real invention is happening in these labs.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
And I still kept -- so, in the last year I've been spending time with

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
heads of state and generals and tribal chiefs who all want this,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
and I keep saying, but this isn't the real thing.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Wait, like, 20 years and then we'll be done.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
And I finally got what's been going on. This is Kernigan and Ritchie

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
inventing UNIX on a PDP.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
PDPs came between mainframes and minicomputers.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
They were tens of thousands of dollars, hard to use,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
but they brought computing down to work groups,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
and everything we do today happened there.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
These Fab Labs are the cost and complexity of a PDP.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
The projection of digital fabrication

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
isn't a projection for the future; we are now in the PDP era.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
We talked in hushed tones about the great discoveries then.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
It was very chaotic, it wasn't, sort of, clear what was going on.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
In the same sense we are now, today, in the minicomputer era

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
of digital fabrication.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
The only problem with that is it breaks everybody's boundaries.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
In DC, I go to every agency that wants to talk, you know;

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
in the Bay Area, I go to every organization you can think of --

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
they all want to talk about it, but it breaks

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
their organizational boundaries. In fact, it's illegal for them,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
in many cases, to equip ordinary people to create

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000
rather than consume technology.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
And that problem is so severe that the ultimate invention

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
coming from this community surprised me:

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
it's the social engineering. That the lab in far north of Norway --

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
this is so far north its satellite dishes look at the ground

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000
rather than the sky because that's where the satellites are --

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000
the lab outgrew the little barn that it was in.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
It was there because they wanted to find animals in the mountains

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000
but it outgrew it, so they built this extraordinary village for the lab.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
This isn't a university; it's not a company. It's essentially

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000
a village for invention; it's a village for the outliers in society,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
and those have been growing up around these Fab Labs

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000
all around the world.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
So this program has split into an NGO foundation,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
a Fab Foundation to support the scaling, a micro VC fund.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000
The person who runs it nicely describes it as

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
"machines that make machines need businesses that make businesses:"

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
it's a cross between micro-finance and VC to do fan-out,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
and then the research partnerships back at MIT for what's

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
making it possible.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
So I'd like to leave you with two thoughts.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.000
There's been a sea change in aid, from top-down mega-projects

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
to bottom-up, grassroots, micro-finance investing in the roots,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
so that everybody's got that that's what works.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
But we still look at technology as top-down mega-projects.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Computing, communication, energy for the rest of the planet

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
are these top-down mega-projects.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
If this room full of heroes is just clever enough,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
you can solve the problems.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
The message coming from the Fab Labs is that

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
the other five billion people on the planet

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
aren't just technical sinks; they're sources.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
The real opportunity is to harness the inventive power of the world

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.000
to locally design and produce solutions to local problems.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
I thought that's the projection 20 years hence into the future,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
but it's where we are today.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
It breaks every organizational boundary we can think of.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
The hardest thing at this point is the social engineering

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
and the organizational engineering, but it's here today.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
And, finally, any talk like this on the future of computing

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000
is required to show Moore's law, but my favorite version --

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000
this is Gordon Moore's original one from his original paper --

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
and what's happened is, year after year after year,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000
we've scaled and we've scaled and we've scaled

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
and we've scaled, and we've scaled and we've scaled,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000
and we've scaled and we've scaled,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
and there's this looming bug of what's going to happen

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
at the end of Moore's law; this ultimate bug is coming.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000
But we're coming to appreciate, is the transition from 2D to 3D,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
from programming bits to programming atoms,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
turns the ends of Moore's law scaling from the ultimate bug

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
to the ultimate feature.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
So, we're just at the edge of this digital revolution in fabrication,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
where the output of computation programs the physical world.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
So, together, these two projects answer questions

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
I hadn't asked carefully. The class at MIT shows the killer app

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
for personal fabrication in the developed world

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
is technology for a market of one: personal expression in technology

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:47.000
that touches a passion unlike anything I've seen in technology

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
for a very long time.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
And the killer app for the rest of the planet is the instrumentation

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
and the fabrication divide: people locally developing solutions

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
to local problems. Thank you.
