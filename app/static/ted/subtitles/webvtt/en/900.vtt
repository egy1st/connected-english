WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
It's a great honor today

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
to share with you

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
The Digital Universe,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
which was created for humanity

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
to really see where we are

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
in the universe.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And so I think we can roll the video that we have.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
[The Himalayas.]

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
(Music)

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The flat horizon that we've evolved with

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
has been a metaphor for the

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
infinite: unbounded resources

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and unlimited capacity

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
for disposal of waste.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It wasn't until we really

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
left Earth,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
got above the atmosphere

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and had seen the horizon

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
bend back on itself,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
that we could understand our planet

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
as a limited condition.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The Digital Universe Atlas

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
has been built

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
at the American Museum of Natural History

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
over the past 12 years.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
We maintain that,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
put that together

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
as a project

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
to really chart the universe

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
across all scales.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
What we see here are satellites around the Earth

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and the Earth in proper registration

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
against the universe, as we see.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
NASA supported this work

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
12 years ago

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
as part of the rebuilding

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
of the Hayden Planetarium

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
so that we would share this with the world.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
The Digital Universe is the basis

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
of our space show productions that we do --

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
our main space shows in the dome.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
But what you see here

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
is the result of, actually, internships

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
that we hosted with Linkoping University

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
in Sweden.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I've had 12 students work on this

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
for their graduate work,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and the result has been this software called Uniview

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and a company called SCISS in Sweden.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
This software

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
allows interactive use,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
so this actual flight path

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and movie that we see here

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
was actually flown live.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I captured this live from my laptop

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
in a cafe called Earth Matters

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, where I live,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and it was done

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
as a collaborative project

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
with the Rubin Museum of Himalayan Art

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
for an exhibit

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
on comparative cosmology.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
And so as we move out,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
we see continuously from our planet

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
all the way out into the realm of galaxies, as we see here,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
light-travel time, giving you a sense of how far away we are.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
As we move out,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
the light from these distant galaxies

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
have taken so long,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
we're essentially backing up into the past.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
We back so far up

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
we're finally seeing a containment around us --

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
the afterglow of the Big Bang.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
This is the WMAP

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
microwave background

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
that we see.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
We'll fly outside it here, just to see this sort of containment.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
If we were outside this,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
it would almost be meaningless, in the sense as before time.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
But this our containment of the visible universe.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
We know the universe is bigger than that which we can see.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Coming back quickly,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
we see here the radio sphere that we jumped out of in the beginning,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
but these are positions,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
the latest positions of exoplanets

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
that we've mapped,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
and our sun here, obviously, with our own solar system.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
What you're going to see -- we're going to have to jump in here pretty quickly

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
between several orders of magnitude

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
to get down to where we see the solar system --

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
these are the paths of

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Voyager 1, Voyager 2, Pioneer 11 and Pioneer 10,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
the first four spacecraft to have left the solar system.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Coming in closer,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
picking up Earth,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
orbit of the Moon, and we see the Earth.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
This map can be updated,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
and we can add in new data.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
I know Dr. Carolyn Porco is the camera P.I.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
for the Cassini mission.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
But here we see the complex trajectory

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
of the Cassini mission

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
color coded for different mission phases,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
ingeniously developed so that

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
45 encounters with the largest moon, Titan,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
which is larger that the planet Mercury,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
diverts the orbit into different parts of mission phase.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
This software allows us to come close

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
and look at parts of this.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
This software can also be networked between domes.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
We have a growing user base of this,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
and we network domes.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
And we can network between domes and classrooms.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
We're actually sharing tours of the universe

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
with the first sub-Saharan

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
planetarium in Ghana

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
as well as

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
new libraries that have been built

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
in the ghettos in Columbia

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and a high school

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
in Cambodia.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
And the Cambodians have

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
actually controlled the Hayden Planetarium from their high school.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
This is an image from Saturday,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
photographed by the Aqua satellite, but through the Uniview software.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
So you're seeing the edge of the Earth.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
This is Nepal.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
This is, in fact, right here is the valley of Lhasa,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
right here in Tibet.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
But we can see the haze

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
from fires and so forth in the Ganges valley

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
down below in India.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
This is Nepal and Tibet.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
And just in closing,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
I'd just like to say this beautiful world that we live on --

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
here we see a bit of the snow

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
that some of you may have had to brave in coming out --

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
so I'd like to just say

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
that what the world needs now

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
is a sense of being able to

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
look at ourselves in this much larger condition now

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
and a much larger sense of what home is.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Because our home is the universe,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
and we are the universe, essentially.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
We carry that in us.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
And to be able to see our context

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
in this larger sense at all scales

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
helps us all, I think, in understanding

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
where we are and who we are in the universe.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Thank you.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
(Applause)
