00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Why grow homes? Because we can.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Right now, America is in an unremitting state of trauma.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And there's a cause for that, all right.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We've got McPeople, McCars, McHouses.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
As an architect, I have to confront something like this.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So what's a technology that will allow us

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
to make ginormous houses?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Well, it's been around for 2,500 years.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It's called pleaching, or grafting trees together,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
or grafting inosculate matter into one contiguous, vascular system.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And we do something different

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
than what we did in the past;

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
we add kind of a modicum of intelligence to that.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
We use CNC to make scaffolding

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
to train semi-epithetic matter, plants,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
into a specific geometry

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
that makes a home that we call a Fab Tree Hab.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It fits into the environment. It is the environment.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
It is the landscape, right?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And you can have a hundred million of these homes,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and it's great because they suck carbon.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
They're perfect.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
You can have 100 million families, or take things out of the suburbs,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
because these are homes that are a part of the environment.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Imagine pre-growing a village --

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
it takes about seven to 10 years --

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and everything is green.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So not only do we do the veggie house,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
we also do the in-vitro meat habitat,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
or homes that we're doing research on now in Brooklyn,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
where, as an architecture office, we're for the first of its kind

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
to put in a molecular cell biology lab

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and start experimenting with regenerative medicine

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and tissue engineering

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and start thinking about what the future would be

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
if architecture and biology became one.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
So we've been doing this for a couple of years, and that's our lab.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And what we do is we grow

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
extracellular matrix from pigs.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
We use a modified inkjet printer,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and we print geometry.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
We print geometry where we can make industrial design objects

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
like, you know, shoes, leather belts,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
handbags, etc.,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
where no sentient creature is harmed.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
It's victimless. It's meat from a test tube.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So our theory is that eventually

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
we should be doing this with homes.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
So here is a typical stud wall,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
an architectural construction,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and this is a section

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
of our proposal for a meat house,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
where you can see we use fatty cells as insulation,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
cilia for dealing with wind loads

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and sphincter muscles for the doors and windows.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
(Laughter)

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And we know it's incredibly ugly.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
It could have been an English Tudor or Spanish Colonial,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
but we kind of chose this shape.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And there it is kind of grown, at least one particular section of it.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
We had a big show in Prague,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and we decided to put it in front of the cathedral

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
so religion can confront the house of meat.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
That's why we grow homes. Thanks very much.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
(Applause)
