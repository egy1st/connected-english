WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Thank you very much.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Please excuse me for sitting; I'm very old.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
(Laughter)

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Well, the topic I'm going to discuss

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
is one which is, in a certain sense, very peculiar

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
because it's very old.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Roughness is part of human life

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
forever and forever,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and ancient authors have written about it.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It was very much uncontrollable,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and in a certain sense,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
it seemed to be the extreme of complexity,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
just a mess, a mess and a mess.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
There are many different kinds of mess.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Now, in fact,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
by a complete fluke,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I got involved many years ago

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
in a study of this form of complexity,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and to my utter amazement,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I found traces --

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
very strong traces, I must say --

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
of order in that roughness.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And so today, I would like to present to you

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
a few examples

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
of what this represents.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I prefer the word roughness

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
to the word irregularity

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
because irregularity --

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
to someone who had Latin

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
in my long-past youth --

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
means the contrary of regularity.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
But it is not so.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Regularity is the contrary of roughness

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
because the basic aspect of the world

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
is very rough.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So let me show you a few objects.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Some of them are artificial.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Others of them are very real, in a certain sense.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Now this is the real. It's a cauliflower.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Now why do I show a cauliflower,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
a very ordinary and ancient vegetable?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Because old and ancient as it may be,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
it's very complicated and it's very simple,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
both at the same time.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
If you try to weigh it -- of course it's very easy to weigh it,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and when you eat it, the weight matters --

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
but suppose you try to

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
measure its surface.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Well, it's very interesting.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
If you cut, with a sharp knife,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
one of the florets of a cauliflower

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and look at it separately,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
you think of a whole cauliflower, but smaller.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And then you cut again,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and you still get small cauliflowers.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
So the experience of humanity

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
has always been that there are some shapes

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
which have this peculiar property,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
that each part is like the whole,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
but smaller.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Now, what did humanity do with that?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Very, very little.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
(Laughter)

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
So what I did actually is to

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
study this problem,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and I found something quite surprising.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
That one can measure roughness

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
by a number, a number,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
2.3, 1.2 and sometimes much more.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
One day, a friend of mine,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
to bug me,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
brought a picture and said,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
"What is the roughness of this curve?"

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I said, "Well, just short of 1.5."

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
It was 1.48.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Now, it didn't take me any time.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
I've been looking at these things for so long.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
So these numbers are the numbers

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
which denote the roughness of these surfaces.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
I hasten to say that these surfaces

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
are completely artificial.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
They were done on a computer,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
and the only input is a number,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
and that number is roughness.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
So on the left,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
I took the roughness copied from many landscapes.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
To the right, I took a higher roughness.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
So the eye, after a while,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
can distinguish these two very well.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Humanity had to learn about measuring roughness.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
This is very rough, and this is sort of smooth, and this perfectly smooth.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Very few things are very smooth.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
So then if you try to ask questions:

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
"What's the surface of a cauliflower?"

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Well, you measure and measure and measure.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Each time you're closer, it gets bigger,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
down to very, very small distances.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
What's the length of the coastline

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
of these lakes?

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
The closer you measure, the longer it is.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
The concept of length of coastline,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
which seems to be so natural

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
because it's given in many cases,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
is, in fact, complete fallacy; there's no such thing.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
You must do it differently.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
What good is that, to know these things?

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Well, surprisingly enough,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
it's good in many ways.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
To begin with, artificial landscapes,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
which I invented sort of,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
are used in cinema all the time.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
We see mountains in the distance.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
They may be mountains, but they may be just formulae, just cranked on.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Now it's very easy to do.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
It used to be very time-consuming, but now it's nothing.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Now look at that. That's a real lung.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Now a lung is something very strange.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
If you take this thing,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
you know very well it weighs very little.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
The volume of a lung is very small,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
but what about the area of the lung?

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Anatomists were arguing very much about that.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Some say that a normal male's lung

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
has an area of the inside

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
of a basketball [court].

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
And the others say, no, five basketball [courts].

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Enormous disagreements.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Why so? Because, in fact, the area of the lung

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
is something very ill-defined.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
The bronchi branch, branch, branch

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
and they stop branching,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
not because of any matter of principle,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
but because of physical considerations:

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
the mucus, which is in the lung.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
So what happens is that in a way

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
you have a much bigger lung,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
but it branches and branches

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
down to distances about the same for a whale, for a man

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
and for a little rodent.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Now, what good is it to have that?

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Well, surprisingly enough, amazingly enough,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
the anatomists had a very poor idea

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
of the structure of the lung until very recently.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And I think that my mathematics,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
surprisingly enough,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
has been of great help

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
to the surgeons

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
studying lung illnesses

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
and also kidney illnesses,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
all these branching systems,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
for which there was no geometry.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
So I found myself, in other words,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
constructing a geometry,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
a geometry of things which had no geometry.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
And a surprising aspect of it

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
is that very often, the rules of this geometry

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
are extremely short.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
You have formulas that long.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
And you crank it several times.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Sometimes repeatedly: again, again, again,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
the same repetition.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
And at the end, you get things like that.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
This cloud is completely,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
100 percent artificial.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Well, 99.9.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
And the only part which is natural

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
is a number, the roughness of the cloud,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
which is taken from nature.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Something so complicated like a cloud,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
so unstable, so varying,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
should have a simple rule behind it.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Now this simple rule

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
is not an explanation of clouds.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
The seer of clouds had to

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
take account of it.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
I don't know how much advanced

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
these pictures are. They're old.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
I was very much involved in it,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
but then turned my attention to other phenomena.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Now, here is another thing

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
which is rather interesting.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
One of the shattering events

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
in the history of mathematics,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
which is not appreciated by many people,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
occurred about 130 years ago,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
145 years ago.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Mathematicians began to create

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
shapes that didn't exist.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Mathematicians got into self-praise

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
to an extent which was absolutely amazing,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
that man can invent things

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
that nature did not know.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
In particular, it could invent

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
things like a curve which fills the plane.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
A curve's a curve, a plane's a plane,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
and the two won't mix.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Well, they do mix.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
A man named Peano

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
did define such curves,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
and it became an object of extraordinary interest.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
It was very important, but mostly interesting

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
because a kind of break,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
a separation between

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
the mathematics coming from reality, on the one hand,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
and new mathematics coming from pure man's mind.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Well, I was very sorry to point out

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
that the pure man's mind

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
has, in fact,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
seen at long last

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
what had been seen for a long time.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
And so here I introduce something,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
the set of rivers of a plane-filling curve.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
And well,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
it's a story unto itself.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
So it was in 1875 to 1925,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
an extraordinary period

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
in which mathematics prepared itself to break out from the world.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
And the objects which were used

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
as examples, when I was

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
a child and a student, as examples

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
of the break between mathematics

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
and visible reality --

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
those objects,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
I turned them completely around.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
I used them for describing

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
some of the aspects of the complexity of nature.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Well, a man named Hausdorff in 1919

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
introduced a number which was just a mathematical joke,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
and I found that this number

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
was a good measurement of roughness.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
When I first told it to my friends in mathematics

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
they said, "Don't be silly. It's just something [silly]."

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Well actually, I was not silly.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
The great painter Hokusai knew it very well.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
The things on the ground are algae.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
He did not know the mathematics; it didn't yet exist.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
And he was Japanese who had no contact with the West.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
But painting for a long time had a fractal side.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
I could speak of that for a long time.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
The Eiffel Tower has a fractal aspect.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
I read the book that Mr. Eiffel wrote about his tower,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
and indeed it was astonishing how much he understood.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
This is a mess, mess, mess, Brownian loop.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
One day I decided --

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
halfway through my career,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
I was held by so many things in my work --

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
I decided to test myself.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Could I just look at something

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
which everybody had been looking at for a long time

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
and find something dramatically new?

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Well, so I looked at these

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
things called Brownian motion -- just goes around.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
I played with it for a while,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
and I made it return to the origin.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Then I was telling my assistant,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
"I don't see anything. Can you paint it?"

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
So he painted it, which means

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
he put inside everything. He said:

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
"Well, this thing came out ..." And I said, "Stop! Stop! Stop!

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
I see; it's an island."

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
And amazing.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
So Brownian motion, which happens to have

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
a roughness number of two, goes around.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
I measured it, 1.33.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Again, again, again.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
Long measurements, big Brownian motions,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
1.33.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Mathematical problem: how to prove it?

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
It took my friends 20 years.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Three of them were having incomplete proofs.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
They got together, and together they had the proof.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
So they got the big [Fields] medal in mathematics,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
one of the three medals that people have received

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
for proving things which I've seen

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
without being able to prove them.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Now everybody asks me at one point or another,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
"How did it all start?

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
What got you in that strange business?"

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
What got you to be,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
at the same time, a mechanical engineer,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
a geographer

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
and a mathematician and so on, a physicist?

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Well actually I started, oddly enough,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
studying stock market prices.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
And so here

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
I had this theory,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
and I wrote books about it --

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
financial prices increments.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
To the left you see data over a long period.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
To the right, on top,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
you see a theory which is very, very fashionable.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
It was very easy, and you can write many books very fast about it.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
(Laughter)

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
There are thousands of books on that.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Now compare that with real price increments.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Where are real price increments?

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Well, these other lines

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
include some real price increments

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
and some forgery which I did.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
So the idea there was

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
that one must be able to -- how do you say? --

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
model price variation.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
And it went really well 50 years ago.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
For 50 years, people were sort of pooh-poohing me

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
because they could do it much, much easier.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
But I tell you, at this point, people listened to me.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
(Laughter)

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
These two curves are averages:

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Standard &amp; Poor, the blue one;

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
and the red one is Standard &amp; Poor's

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
from which the five biggest discontinuities

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
are taken out.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Now discontinuities are a nuisance,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
so in many studies of prices,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
one puts them aside.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
"Well, acts of God.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
And you have the little nonsense which is left.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Acts of God." In this picture,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
five acts of God are as important as everything else.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
In other words,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
it is not acts of God that we should put aside.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
That is the meat, the problem.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
If you master these, you master price,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
and if you don't master these, you can master

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
the little noise as well as you can,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
but it's not important.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Well, here are the curves for it.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Now, I get to the final thing, which is the set

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
of which my name is attached.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
In a way, it's the story of my life.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
My adolescence was spent

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
during the German occupation of France.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Since I thought that I might

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
vanish within a day or a week,

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
I had very big dreams.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
And after the war,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
I saw an uncle again.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
My uncle was a very prominent mathematician, and he told me,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
"Look, there's a problem

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
which I could not solve 25 years ago,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
and which nobody can solve.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
This is a construction of a man named [Gaston] Julia

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
and [Pierre] Fatou.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
If you could

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
find something new, anything,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
you will get your career made."

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Very simple.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
So I looked,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
and like the thousands of people that had tried before,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
I found nothing.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
But then the computer came,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
and I decided to apply the computer,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
not to new problems in mathematics --

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
like this wiggle wiggle, that's a new problem --

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
but to old problems.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
And I went from what's called

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
real numbers, which are points on a line,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
to imaginary, complex numbers,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
which are points on a plane,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
which is what one should do there,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
and this shape came out.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
This shape is of an extraordinary complication.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
The equation is hidden there,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
z goes into z squared, plus c.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
It's so simple, so dry.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
It's so uninteresting.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Now you turn the crank once, twice:

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
twice,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
marvels come out.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
I mean this comes out.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
I don't want to explain these things.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
This comes out. This comes out.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
Shapes which are of such complication,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
such harmony and such beauty.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
This comes out

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
repeatedly, again, again, again.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
And that was one of my major discoveries,

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
to find that these islands were the same

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
as the whole big thing, more or less.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
And then you get these

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
extraordinary baroque decorations all over the place.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
All that from this little formula,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
which has whatever, five symbols in it.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
And then this one.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
The color was added for two reasons.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
First of all, because these shapes

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
are so complicated

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
that one couldn't make any sense of the numbers.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
And if you plot them, you must choose some system.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
And so my principle has been

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
to always present the shapes

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
with different colorings

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
because some colorings emphasize that,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
and others it is that or that.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
It's so complicated.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
(Laughter)

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
In 1990, I was in Cambridge, U.K.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
to receive a prize from the university,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
and three days later,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
a pilot was flying over the landscape and found this thing.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
So where did this come from?

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Obviously, from extraterrestrials.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
(Laughter)

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Well, so the newspaper in Cambridge

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
published an article about that "discovery"

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
and received the next day

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
5,000 letters from people saying,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
"But that's simply a Mandelbrot set very big."

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Well, let me finish.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
This shape here just came

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
out of an exercise in pure mathematics.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
Bottomless wonders spring from simple rules,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
which are repeated without end.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Thank you very much.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:47.000
(Applause)
