00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.536
I'm Ellen and I'm totally
obsessed with food.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.560
But I didn't start out obsessed with food.

00:00:05.584 --> 00:00:08.036
I started out obsessed
with global security policy,

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.516
because I lived in New York during 9/11
and it was a very relevant thing.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.493
I got from global security policy to food

00:00:13.517 --> 00:00:16.236
because I realized when I'm hungry,
I'm really pissed off,

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.436
and I'm assuming
the rest of the world is too.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.156
Especially if you and your kids are hungry
and your neighbor's kids are hungry

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.036
and your whole neighborhood is hungry.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.216
And actually, it looks like
the areas of the world that are hungry

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.936
are also the areas of the world
that are pretty insecure.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.696
So I took a job at the United Nations
World Food Programme

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.976
as a way to try to address
these security issues

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.416
through food security issues.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.933
There, I came across what I think
is the most brilliant of their programs.

00:00:39.957 --> 00:00:42.582
It's called School Feeding
and it's a really simple idea

00:00:42.606 --> 00:00:45.186
to get in the middle
of the cycle of poverty and hunger

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.303
that continues for a lot of people
around the world, and stop it.

00:00:48.327 --> 00:00:50.296
A free school meal gets kids into school,

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.696
which is education,
the first step out of poverty,

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.216
but it also gives them the micronutrients
and the macronutrients they need

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.936
to develop mentally and physically.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.376
While I was working at the UN,
I met this girl. Her name is Lauren Bush.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.067
And she had this really awesome idea
to sell the bag, called the "Feed Bag" --

00:01:05.091 --> 00:01:08.536
which is really beautifully ironic
because you can strap on the Feed Bag.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.296
But each bag we'd sell would provide

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.856
a year's worth
of school meals for one kid.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.776
It's so simple, and we thought, OK,

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.176
it costs between 20 and 50 bucks
to provide school feeding for a year.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.256
We could sell these bags
and raise a ton of money and awareness

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.696
for the World Food Programme.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.776
But at the UN,
sometimes things move slowly

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.136
and they basically said no.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.776
And we thought, this is such a good idea,
it's going to raise so much money.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.136
So we said screw it,
we'll start our own company,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.589
which we did, three years ago.

00:01:33.613 --> 00:01:36.416
That was my first dream,
to start this company called FEED,

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.336
and here's a screenshot of our website.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.016
We did a bag for Haiti
just a month after the earthquake

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.096
to provide school meals for kids in Haiti.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.336
So FEED's doing great.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.336
We've so far provided 55 million meals
to kids around the world

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.776
by selling now 550,000 bags,
a ton of bags, a lot of bags.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.536
All this time you're really --

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.416
hunger is a hard thing to think about,

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.296
because what we think about is eating.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.576
I think about eating a lot
and I really love it.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.216
And the thing that's strange
about international hunger

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.096
and talking about international issues

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.736
is that most people want to know:

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.216
"What are you doing for America's kids?"

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.256
There's definitely hunger in America:

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.816
49 million people
and almost 16.7 million children.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.216
I mean that's pretty dramatic
for our own country.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.776
Hunger definitely means
something different in America

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.216
than it does internationally,

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.416
but it's incredibly important
to address hunger in our own country.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.136
But the bigger problem
that we all know about is obesity,

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.416
and it's dramatic.

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.936
The other thing that's dramatic

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.416
is that both hunger and obesity
have really risen in the last 30 years.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.016
Unfortunately, obesity's
not only an American problem.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.376
It's actually been spreading
all around the world

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.456
and mainly through our kind
of food systems that we're exporting.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.896
The numbers are pretty crazy.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.016
There's a billion people
obese or overweight

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.416
and a billion people hungry.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.696
So those seem like
two bifurcated problems,

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.936
but I kind of started
to think about, you know,

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.296
what is obesity and hunger?

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.936
What are both those things about?

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.416
Well, they're both about food.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.416
And when you think about food,

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.256
the underpinning of food in both cases
is potentially problematic agriculture.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.176
And agriculture is where food comes from.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.216
Agriculture in America's very interesting.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.976
It's very consolidated

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.936
and the foods that are produced
lead to the foods that we eat.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.136
The foods that are produced are,
more or less, corn, soy and wheat.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.816
And that's three-quarters
of the food that we're eating:

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.376
processed foods and fast foods.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.416
Unfortunately, in our agricultural system,

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.896
we haven't done a good job
in the last three decades

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.256
of exporting those technologies
around the world.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.616
So African agriculture, which is the place
of most hunger in the world,

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.336
has actually fallen precipitously
as hunger has risen.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.456
So somehow we're not making the connect

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.816
between exporting
a good agricultural system

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.096
that will help feed people
all around the world.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.416
Who is farming?
That's what I was wondering.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.056
So I went and stood
on a big grain bin in the Midwest,

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.456
and that really didn't help me
understand farming,

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.376
but I think it's a really cool picture.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.336
And the reality is
that between farmers in America --

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.296
who actually, quite frankly,
when I spend time in the Midwest,

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.056
are pretty large in general.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.896
And their farms are also large.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.896
But farmers in the rest of the world
are actually quite skinny,

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.635
and that's because they're starving.

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:02.296
Most hungry people in the world
are subsistence farmers.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.136
And most of those people are women --

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.056
which is a totally other topic
that I won't get on right now,

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.536
but I'd love to do
the feminist thing at some point.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.136
I think it's really interesting to look
at agriculture from these two sides.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.856
There's this large, consolidated farming
that's led to what we eat in America,

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.856
and it's really been since around 1980,
after the oil crisis,

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.696
when, you know -- mass consolidation,

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.936
mass exodus of small farmers
in this country.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.576
And then in the same time period,

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.576
we've kind of left Africa's farmers
to do their own thing.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.456
Unfortunately, what is farmed
ends up as what we eat.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.496
And in America, a lot of what we eat
has led to obesity

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.496
and has led to a real change

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.160
in sort of what our diet is,
in the last 30 years.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:40.856
It's crazy.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.736
A fifth of kids under two drinks soda.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.736
Hello! You don't put soda in bottles.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.736
But people do, because it's so cheap,

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.016
and so our whole food system
in the last 30 years has really shifted.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.736
I mean, you know,
it's not just in our own country,

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:56.696
but really we're exporting
the system around the world,

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.616
and when you look at the data
of least developed countries --

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.056
especially in cities,
which are growing really rapidly --

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.376
people are eating
American processed foods.

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.736
And in one generation,
they're going from hunger

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.736
and all of the detrimental
health effects of hunger

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.376
to obesity and things like diabetes
and heart disease in one generation.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.056
So the problematic food system
is affecting both hunger and obesity.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.256
Not to beat a dead horse,
but this is a global food system

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.376
where there's a billion people hungry
and a billion people obese.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.456
I think that's the only way to look at it.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.336
And instead of taking these two things

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.536
as bifurcated problems
that are very separate,

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.456
it's really important
to look at them as one system.

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.856
We get a lot of our food
from all around the world

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.056
and people from all around the world
are importing our food system,

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.096
so it's incredibly relevant
to start a new way of looking at it.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.376
I've learned --
and the technology people here,

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.896
which I'm totally not one of --

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.856
but apparently, it really takes 30 years

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.696
for a lot of technologies
to become really endemic to us,

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.216
like the mouse
and the Internet and Windows.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.856
You know, there's 30-year cycles.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.016
I think 2010 can be
a really interesting year

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.056
because it is the end
of the 30-year cycle,

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.336
and it's the birthday
of the global food system.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.576
That's the first birthday
I want to talk about.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:08.336
If we really think that this is something
that's happened in the last 30 years,

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.616
there's hope in that.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.496
It's the 30th anniversary of GMO crops

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.456
and the Big Gulp, Chicken McNuggets,
high-fructose corn syrup,

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.736
the farm crisis in America

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.896
and the change in how we've addressed
agriculture internationally.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.776
So there's a lot of reasons
to take this 30-year time period

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.256
as sort of the creation
of this new food system.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.416
I'm not the only one who's obsessed
with this whole 30-year thing.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.136
The icons like Michael Pollan
and Jamie Oliver in his TED Prize wish

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.096
both addressed this last
three-decade time period

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.136
as incredibly relevant
for food system change.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.736
Well, I really care about 1980

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.896
because it's also the 30th
anniversary of me this year.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.576
And so in my lifetime,

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.536
a lot of what's happened in the world --

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.496
and being a person obsessed with food --

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.376
a lot of this has really changed.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.496
So my second dream is that I think
we can look to the next 30 years

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:56.936
as a time to change the food system again.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.896
And we know what's happened in the past,

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.096
so if we start now
and we look at technologies

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.296
and improvements
to the food system long-term,

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:05.416
we might be able
to recreate the food system

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.776
so when I give my next talk
and I'm 60 years old,

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.936
I'll be able to say
that it's been a success.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.616
So I'm announcing today
the start of a new organization,

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.656
or a new fund within the FEED Foundation,
called the 30 Project.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.416
And the 30 Project is really focused

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.256
on these long-term ideas
for food system change.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.776
And I think by aligning international
advocates that are addressing hunger

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.216
and domestic advocates
that are addressing obesity,

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.576
we might actually look
for long-term solutions

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.016
that will make the food system
better for everyone.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:33.816
We all tend to think
that these systems are quite different

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.616
and people argue whether or not
organic can feed the world,

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.056
but if we take a 30-year view,
there's more hope in collaborative ideas.

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.056
So I'm hoping that by connecting
really disparate organizations

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.816
like the ONE campaign and Slow Food,

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.216
which don't seem right now
to have much in common,

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.096
we can talk about holistic,
long-term, systemic solutions

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.056
that will improve food for everyone.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.509
Some ideas I've had is like,
look, the reality is --

00:07:54.533 --> 00:07:56.976
kids in the South Bronx
need apples and carrots

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.656
and so do kids in Botswana.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:01.616
And how are we going
to get those kids those nutritious foods?

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.296
Another thing that's become incredibly
global is production of meat and fish.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.056
Understanding how to produce protein

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.096
in a way that's healthy
for the environment

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.376
and healthy for people

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.536
will be incredibly important
to address things like climate change

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.616
and how we use petrochemical fertilizers.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.936
And, you know, these are
really relevant topics

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.776
that are long-term and important

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.856
for both people in Africa
who are small farmers

00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.416
and people in America
who are farmers and eaters.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:28.936
And I also think that thinking
about processed foods in a new way,

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.616
where we actually
price the negative externalities

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.336
like petrochemicals
and like fertilizer runoff

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.176
into the price of a bag of chips --

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:40.856
Well, if that bag of chips then becomes
inherently more expensive than an apple,

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:45.056
then maybe it's time for a different sense
of personal responsibility in food choice

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.016
because the choices are actually choices

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.976
instead of three-quarters of the products
being made just from corn, soy and wheat.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.416
The 30Project.org is launched

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.376
and I've gathered a coalition
of a few organizations to start.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.576
And it'll be growing
over the next few months.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.936
But I really hope
that you will all think of ways

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.696
that you can look long-term
at things like the food system

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:03.936
and make change.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:09.253
