00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Trees epitomize stasis.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Trees are rooted in the ground in one place

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
for many human generations,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
but if we shift our perspective

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
from the trunk to the twigs,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
trees become very dynamic entities,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
moving and growing.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And I decided to explore this movement

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
by turning trees into artists.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I simply tied the end of a paintbrush onto a twig.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I waited for the wind to come up and held up a canvas,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and that produced art.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The piece of art you see on your left

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
is painted by a western red cedar

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and that on your right by a Douglas fir,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and what I learned was that different species

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
have different signatures, like a Picasso versus a Monet.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
But I was also interested in the movement of trees

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and how this art might let me capture that and quantify it,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
so to measure the distance that a single vine maple tree --

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
which produced this painting -- moved in a single year,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I simply measured and summed

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
each of those lines.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I multiplied them by the number of twigs per branch

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
and the number of branches per tree

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and then divided that by the number of minutes per year.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And so I was able to calculate

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
how far a single tree moved in a single year.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
You might have a guess.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
The answer is actually 186,540 miles,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
or seven times around the globe.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And so simply by shifting our perspective from a single trunk

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
to the many dynamic twigs,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
we are able to see that trees are not simply static entities,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
but rather extremely dynamic.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And I began to think about ways that

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
we might consider this lesson of trees,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
to consider other entities that are also static and stuck,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
but which cry for change and dynamicism,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and one of those entities is our prisons.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Prisons, of course, are where people who break our laws

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
are stuck, confined behind bars.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And our prison system itself is stuck.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
The United States has over 2.3 million

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
incarcerated men and women.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
That number is rising.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Of the 100 incarcerated people that are released,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
60 will return to prison.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Funds for education, for training

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and for rehabilitation are declining,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
so this despairing cycle of incarceration continues.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I decided to ask whether the lesson

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I had learned from trees as artists

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
could be applied to a static institution

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
such as our prisons,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and I think the answer is yes.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
In the year 2007,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I started a partnership

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
with the Washington State Department of Corrections.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Working with four prisons, we began bringing science and scientists,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
sustainability and conservation projects

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
to four state prisons.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
We give science lectures,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and the men here are choosing to come to our science lectures

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
instead of watching television or weightlifting.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
That, I think, is movement.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
We partnered with the Nature Conservancy

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
for inmates at Stafford Creek Correctional Center

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
to grow endangered prairie plants

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
for restoration of relic prairie areas in Washington state.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
That, I think, is movement.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
We worked with the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
to grow endangered frogs -- the Oregon spotted frog --

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
for later release into protected wetlands.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
That, I think, is movement.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And just recently, we've begun to work with

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
those men who are segregated

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
in what we call Supermax facilities.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
They've incurred violent infractions

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
by becoming violent with guards

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
and with other prisoners.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
They're kept in bare cells like this

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
for 23 hours a day.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
When they have meetings with their review boards or mental health professionals,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
they're placed in immobile booths like this.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
For one hour a day

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
they're brought to these bleak and bland exercise yards.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Although we can't bring trees and prairie plants

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
and frogs into these environments,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
we are bringing images of nature

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
into these exercise yards,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
putting them on the walls, so at least they get contact

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
with visual images of nature.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
This is Mr. Lopez, who has been in solitary confinement for 18 months,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
and he's providing input on the types of images

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
that he believes would make him and his fellow inmates

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
more serene, more calm,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
less apt to violence.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And so what we see, I think,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
is that small, collective movements of change

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
can perhaps move

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
an entity such as our own prison system

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
in a direction of hope.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
We know that trees are static entities

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
when we look at their trunks.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
But if trees can create art,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
if they can encircle the globe seven times in one year,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
if prisoners can grow plants and raise frogs,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
then perhaps there are other static entities

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
that we hold inside ourselves,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
like grief, like addictions,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
like racism,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
that can also change.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Thank you very much.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000
(Applause)
