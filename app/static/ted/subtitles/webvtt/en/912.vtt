WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I still remember the day in school

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
when our teacher told us

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
that the world population had become

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
three billion people,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and that was in 1960.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I'm going to talk now about

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
how world population has changed from that year

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and into the future,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
but I will not use digital technology,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
as I've done during my first five TEDTalks.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Instead, I have progressed,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and I am, today, launching

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
a brand new analog teaching technology

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that I picked up from IKEA:

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
this box.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
This box contains one billion people.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And our teacher told us

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
that the industrialized world, 1960,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
had one billion people.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
In the developing world, she said,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
they had two billion people.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And they lived away then.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
There was a big gap between

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
the one billion in the industrialized world

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and the two billion in the developing world.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
In the industrialized world,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
people were healthy,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
educated, rich,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and they had small families.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And their aspiration

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
was to buy a car.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And in 1960, all Swedes were saving

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
to try to buy a Volvo like this.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
This was the economic level at which Sweden was.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
But in contrast to this,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
in the developing world, far away,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
the aspiration of the average family there

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
was to have food for the day.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
They were saving

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
to be able to buy a pair of shoes.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
There was an enormous gap in the world

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
when I grew up.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
And this gap between the West and the rest

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
has created a mindset of the world,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
which we still use linguistically

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
when we talk about "the West"

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and "the Developing World."

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
But the world has changed,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and it's overdue to upgrade that mindset

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and that taxonomy of the world, and to understand it.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And that's what I'm going to show you,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
because since 1960

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
what has happened in the world up to 2010

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
is that a staggering

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
four billion people

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
have been added to the world population.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Just look how many.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
The world population has doubled

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
since I went to school.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And of course, there's been economic growth in the West.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
A lot of companies have happened to grow the economy,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
so the Western population moved over to here.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And now their aspiration is not only to have a car.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Now they want to have a holiday on a very remote destination

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and they want to fly.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
So this is where they are today.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And the most successful of the developing countries,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
they have moved on, you know,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
and they have become emerging economies, we call them.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
They are now buying cars.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And what happened a month ago

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
was that the Chinese company, Geely,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
they acquired the Volvo company,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and then finally the Swedes understood that

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
something big had happened in the world.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
(Laughter)

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
So there they are.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And the tragedy is that the two billion over here

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
that is struggling for food and shoes,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
they are still almost as poor

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
as they were 50 years ago.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
The new thing is that

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
we have the biggest pile of billions, the three billions here,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
which are also becoming emerging economies,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
because they are quite healthy, relatively well-educated,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
and they already also have two to three children

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
per woman, as those [richer also] have.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And their aspiration now

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
is, of course, to buy a bicycle,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
and then later on they would like to have a motorbike also.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
But this is the world

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
we have today,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
no longer any gap.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
But the distance from the poorest here, the very poorest,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
to the very richest over here is wider than ever.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
But there is a continuous world

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
from walking, biking,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
driving, flying --

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
there are people on all levels,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
and most people tend to be somewhere in the middle.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
This is the new world we have today

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
in 2010.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
And what will happen in the future?

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Well, I'm going to project

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
into 2050.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
I was in Shanghai recently,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
and I listened to what's happening in China,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
and it's pretty sure that they will catch up,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
just as Japan did.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
All the projections [say that] this one [billion] will [only] grow with

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
one to two or three percent.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
[But this second] grows with seven, eight percent, and then they will end up here.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
They will start flying.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
And these

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
lower or middle income countries, the emerging income countries,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
they will also forge forwards economically.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
And if,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
but only if,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
we invest in the right green technology --

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
so that we can avoid severe climate change,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
and energy can still be relatively cheap --

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
then they will move all the way up here.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
And they will start to buy

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
electric cars.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
This is what we will find there.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
So what about the poorest two billion?

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
What about the poorest two billion here?

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Will they move on?

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Well, here population [growth] comes in

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
because there [among emerging economies] we already have two to three children per woman,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
family planning is widely used,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
and population growth is coming to an end.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Here [among the poorest], population is growing.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
So these [poorest] two billion will, in the next decades,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
increase to three billion,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
and they will thereafter

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
increase to four billion.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
There is nothing --

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
but a nuclear war of a kind we've never seen --

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
that can stop this [growth] from happening.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Because we already have this [growth] in process.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
But if, and only if,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
[the poorest] get out of poverty,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
they get education, they get improved child survival,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
they can buy a bicycle and a cell phone and come [to live] here,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
then population growth

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
will stop in 2050.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
We cannot have people on this level

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
looking for food and shoes

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
because then we get continued population growth.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
And let me show you why

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
by converting back to the old-time

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
digital technology.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Here I have on the screen

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
my country bubbles.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Every bubble is a country. The size is population.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
The colors show the continent.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
The yellow on there is the Americas;

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
dark blue is Africa; brown is Europe;

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
green is the Middle East

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
and this light blue is South Asia.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
That's India and this is China. Size is population.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Here I have children per woman:

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
two children, four children, six children, eight children --

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
big families, small families.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
The year is 1960.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
And down here, child survival,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
the percentage of children surviving childhood

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
up to starting school:

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent, 90,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
and almost 100 percent, as we have today

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
in the wealthiest and healthiest countries.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
But look, this is the world my teacher talked about in 1960:

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
one billion Western world here --

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
high child-survival, small families --

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
and all the rest,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
the rainbow of developing countries,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
with very large families

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
and poor child survival.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
What has happened? I start the world. Here we go.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Can you see, as the years pass by, child survival is increasing?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
They get soap, hygiene, education,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
vaccination, penicillin

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
and then family planning. Family size is decreasing.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
[When] they get up to 90-percent child survival, then families decrease,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
and most of the Arab countries in the Middle East

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
is falling down there [to small families].

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Look, Bangladesh catching up with India.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
The whole emerging world

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
joins the Western world

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
with good child survival

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
and small family size,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
but we still have the poorest billion.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Can you see the poorest billion,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
those [two] boxes I had over here?

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
They are still up here.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
And they still have a child survival

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
of only 70 to 80 percent,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
meaning that if you have six children born,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
there will be at least four who survive

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
to the next generation.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
And the population will double in one generation.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
So the only way

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
of really getting world population [growth] to stop

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
is to continue to improve child survival

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
to 90 percent.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
That's why investments by Gates Foundation,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
UNICEF and aid organizations,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
together with national government in the poorest countries,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
are so good;

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
because they are actually

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
helping us to reach

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
a sustainable population size of the world.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
We can stop at nine billion if we do the right things.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Child survival is the new green.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
It's only by child survival

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
that we will stop population growth.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
And will it happen?

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Well, I'm not an optimist,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
neither am I a pessimist.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
I'm a very serious "possibilist."

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
It's a new category where we take emotion apart,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
and we just work analytically with the world.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
It can be done.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
We can have a much more just world.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
With green technology

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
and with investments to alleviate poverty,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
and global governance,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
the world can become like this.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
And look at the position of the old West.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Remember when this blue box was all alone,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
leading the world, living its own life.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
This will not happen [again].

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
The role of the old West in the new world

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
is to become the foundation

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
of the modern world --

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
nothing more, nothing less.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
But it's a very important role.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Do it well and get used to it.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Thank you very much.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
(Applause)
