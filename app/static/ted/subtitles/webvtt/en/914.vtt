WEBVTT

00:00:01.158 --> 00:00:03.103
This is the ocean as I used to know it.

00:00:03.825 --> 00:00:08.038
And I find that since I've been
in the Gulf a couple of times,

00:00:08.062 --> 00:00:12.562
I really kind of am traumatized
because whenever I look at the ocean now,

00:00:12.586 --> 00:00:15.047
no matter where I am,

00:00:15.071 --> 00:00:18.976
even where I know
that none of the oil has gone,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.976
I sort of see slicks,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.247
and I'm finding that I'm very much
haunted by it.

00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:28.862
But what I want to talk to you about today

00:00:28.886 --> 00:00:32.416
is a lot of things that try
to put all of this in context,

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:38.414
not just about the oil eruption,
but what it means and why it has happened.

00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:40.073
First, just a little bit about me.

00:00:40.097 --> 00:00:42.609
I'm basically just a guy
that likes to go fishing

00:00:42.633 --> 00:00:45.589
ever since I was a little kid,
and because I did,

00:00:45.613 --> 00:00:47.680
I wound up studying sea birds

00:00:47.704 --> 00:00:51.126
to try to stay in the coastal habitats
that I so loved.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.736
And now I mainly write books
about how the ocean is changing,

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.660
and the ocean is certainly
changing very rapidly.

00:00:58.684 --> 00:01:04.497
Now we saw this graphic earlier on,
that we really live on a hard marble

00:01:04.521 --> 00:01:07.976
that has just a slight bit
of wetness to it.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.242
It's like you dipped a marble in water.

00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:12.333
And the same thing with the atmosphere:

00:01:12.357 --> 00:01:15.582
If you took all the atmosphere
and rolled it up in a ball,

00:01:15.606 --> 00:01:18.524
you would get that little sphere
of gas on the right.

00:01:18.548 --> 00:01:23.777
So we live on the most fragile
little soap bubble you can imagine,

00:01:23.801 --> 00:01:28.564
a very sacred soap bubble,
but one that is very, very easy to affect.

00:01:28.588 --> 00:01:33.435
And all the burning of oil and coal
and gas, all the fossil fuels,

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:35.628
have changed the atmosphere greatly.

00:01:35.652 --> 00:01:38.573
Carbon dioxide level
has gone up and up and up.

00:01:38.597 --> 00:01:40.914
We're warming the climate.

00:01:40.938 --> 00:01:42.949
So the blowout in the Gulf

00:01:42.973 --> 00:01:47.118
is just a little piece
of a much larger problem

00:01:47.142 --> 00:01:51.216
that we have with the energy
that we use to run civilization.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.671
Beyond warming,

00:01:52.695 --> 00:01:56.389
we have the problem
of the oceans getting more acidified --

00:01:56.413 --> 00:02:00.555
and already measurably so,
and already affecting animals.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.628
Now in the laboratory, if you take a clam
and you put it in the pH that is not 8.1,

00:02:07.652 --> 00:02:11.379
which is the normal pH
of seawater, but 7.5,

00:02:11.403 --> 00:02:14.009
it dissolves in about three days.

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:17.828
If you take a sea urchin larva from 8.1,

00:02:17.852 --> 00:02:22.144
put it in a pH of 7.7 --
not a huge change --

00:02:22.168 --> 00:02:24.821
it becomes deformed and dies.

00:02:24.845 --> 00:02:31.687
Already, commercial oyster larvae
are dying at large scales in some places.

00:02:32.247 --> 00:02:36.582
Coral reefs are growing slower
in some places because of this problem.

00:02:36.606 --> 00:02:38.218
So this really matters.

00:02:38.242 --> 00:02:42.599
Now, let's take a little tour
around the Gulf a little bit.

00:02:42.623 --> 00:02:46.012
One of the things that really impresses me
about the people in the Gulf:

00:02:46.036 --> 00:02:48.324
They are really, really aquatic people.

00:02:48.348 --> 00:02:49.976
And they can handle water.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.632
They can handle a hurricane
that comes and goes.

00:02:52.656 --> 00:02:54.976
When the water goes down,
they know what to do.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.756
But when it's something other than water,
and their water habitat changes,

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.429
they don't have many options.

00:03:01.453 --> 00:03:05.511
In fact, those entire communities
really don't have many options.

00:03:05.535 --> 00:03:08.171
They don't have another thing they can do.

00:03:08.195 --> 00:03:12.268
They can't go and work
in the local hotel business

00:03:12.292 --> 00:03:15.000
because there isn't one
in their community.

00:03:16.522 --> 00:03:20.980
If you go to the Gulf and you look around,
you do see a lot of oil.

00:03:21.004 --> 00:03:22.853
You see a lot of oil on the ocean.

00:03:22.877 --> 00:03:24.976
You see a lot of oil on the shoreline.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.976
If you go to the site of the blowout,
it looks pretty unbelievable.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.976
It looks like you just emptied
the oil pan in your car,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.271
and you just dumped it in the ocean.

00:03:34.295 --> 00:03:37.160
And one of the really
most incredible things, I think,

00:03:37.184 --> 00:03:40.756
is that there's nobody out there
trying to collect it

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.583
at the site where it is densest.

00:03:44.397 --> 00:03:48.432
Parts of the ocean there
look just absolutely apocalyptic.

00:03:50.557 --> 00:03:53.962
You go in along the shore,
you can find it everywhere.

00:03:55.056 --> 00:03:56.212
It's really messy.

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:58.607
If you go to the places
where it's just arriving,

00:03:58.631 --> 00:04:01.066
like the eastern part
of the Gulf, in Alabama,

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.976
there's still people using the beach

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.143
while there are people
cleaning up the beach.

00:04:05.167 --> 00:04:07.889
And they have a very strange
way of cleaning up the beach.

00:04:07.913 --> 00:04:10.572
They're not allowed to put
more than 10 pounds of sand

00:04:10.596 --> 00:04:12.304
in a 50-gallon plastic bag.

00:04:12.328 --> 00:04:14.684
They have thousands
and thousands of plastic bags.

00:04:14.708 --> 00:04:16.998
I don't know what they'll do
with all that stuff.

00:04:17.022 --> 00:04:19.743
Meanwhile, there are still
people trying to use the beach.

00:04:19.767 --> 00:04:22.545
They don't see the sign
that says: "Stay out of the water."

00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:23.998
Their kids are in the water;

00:04:24.022 --> 00:04:26.951
they're getting tar all over
their clothes and their sandals--

00:04:26.975 --> 00:04:28.186
It's a mess.

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.714
If you go to where the oil has been
for a while, it's an even bigger mess.

00:04:31.738 --> 00:04:34.122
And there's basically
nobody there anymore,

00:04:34.146 --> 00:04:37.012
a few people trying to keep using it.

00:04:37.758 --> 00:04:40.096
You see people who are really
shell-shocked.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.109
They are very hardworking people.

00:04:42.133 --> 00:04:44.743
All they know about life
is they get up in the morning,

00:04:44.767 --> 00:04:47.063
and if their engine starts,
they go to work.

00:04:47.087 --> 00:04:51.376
They always felt that
they could rely on the assurances

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.690
that nature brought them
through the ecosystem of the Gulf.

00:04:54.714 --> 00:04:57.506
They're finding that their world
is really collapsing.

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:03.416
And so you can see, literally,
signs of their shock ...

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.476
signs of their outrage ...

00:05:10.622 --> 00:05:12.439
signs of their anger ...

00:05:17.321 --> 00:05:19.765
and signs of their grief.

00:05:20.834 --> 00:05:23.103
These are the things that you can see.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.609
There's a lot you can't see,
also, underwater.

00:05:29.626 --> 00:05:31.495
What's going on underwater?

00:05:31.519 --> 00:05:35.128
Well, some people say
there are oil plumes.

00:05:35.152 --> 00:05:37.976
Some people say there are not oil plumes.

00:05:38.823 --> 00:05:41.174
And Congressman Markey asks, you know,

00:05:41.198 --> 00:05:46.155
"Is it going to take a submarine ride
to see if there are really oil plumes?"

00:05:46.727 --> 00:05:48.638
But I couldn't take a submarine ride --

00:05:48.662 --> 00:05:52.751
especially between the time I knew
I was coming here and today --

00:05:52.775 --> 00:05:55.976
so I had to do a little experiment myself

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.386
to see if there was oil
in the Gulf of Mexico.

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:00.065
So this is the Gulf of Mexico ...

00:06:01.336 --> 00:06:02.983
sparkling place full of fish.

00:06:04.411 --> 00:06:07.104
And I created a little oil spill
in the Gulf of Mexico.

00:06:07.874 --> 00:06:10.574
And I learned, in fact,
I confirmed the hypothesis

00:06:10.598 --> 00:06:12.800
that oil and water don't mix ...

00:06:14.309 --> 00:06:16.610
until you add a dispersant ...

00:06:18.088 --> 00:06:19.285
and then ...

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:22.322
they start mixing.

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:27.630
And you add a little energy
from the wind and the waves,

00:06:27.654 --> 00:06:30.949
and you get a big mess,

00:06:30.973 --> 00:06:34.108
a big mess that you can't possibly clean,

00:06:34.132 --> 00:06:37.153
you can't touch, you can't extract

00:06:37.177 --> 00:06:40.442
and, I think most importantly --
this is what I think --

00:06:40.466 --> 00:06:41.976
you can't see it.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.334
I think it's being hidden on purpose.

00:06:45.358 --> 00:06:47.976
Now this is such a catastrophe
and such a mess

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.670
that lots of stuff is leaking out
on the edges of the information stream.

00:06:51.694 --> 00:06:53.351
But as many people have said,

00:06:53.375 --> 00:06:56.485
there's a large attempt
to suppress what's going on.

00:06:56.509 --> 00:07:03.481
Personally, I think that the dispersants
are a major strategy to hide the body,

00:07:03.505 --> 00:07:06.644
because we put the murderer
in charge of the crime scene.

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:08.976
But you can see it.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.188
You can see where the oil
is concentrated at the surface,

00:07:13.212 --> 00:07:15.843
and then it is attacked,

00:07:15.867 --> 00:07:18.823
because they don't want
the evidence, in my opinion.

00:07:19.377 --> 00:07:20.527
OK.

00:07:20.898 --> 00:07:23.108
We heard that bacteria eat oil?

00:07:23.419 --> 00:07:24.976
So do sea turtles.

00:07:25.525 --> 00:07:26.933
When it breaks up,

00:07:26.957 --> 00:07:30.431
it has a long way to go
before it gets down to bacteria.

00:07:30.896 --> 00:07:33.976
Turtles eat it.
It gets in the gills of fish.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.257
These guys have to swim around through it.

00:07:36.281 --> 00:07:41.118
I heard the most incredible story today
when I was on the train coming here.

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:43.976
A writer named Ted Williams called me,

00:07:44.523 --> 00:07:47.407
and he was asking me
a couple of questions about what I saw,

00:07:47.431 --> 00:07:50.574
because he's writing an article
for Audubon magazine.

00:07:50.598 --> 00:07:54.345
He said that he had been in the Gulf
a little while ago; like about a week ago,

00:07:54.369 --> 00:07:58.283
and a guy who had
been a recreational fishing guide

00:07:58.307 --> 00:08:00.976
took him out to show him what's going on.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.976
That guide's entire calendar year
is canceled bookings.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.913
He has no bookings left.

00:08:07.937 --> 00:08:10.976
Everybody wanted their deposit back,
everybody is fleeing.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.967
That's the story of thousands of people.

00:08:12.991 --> 00:08:18.069
But he told Ted
that on the last day he went out,

00:08:18.625 --> 00:08:22.347
a bottlenose dolphin
suddenly appeared next to the boat,

00:08:22.767 --> 00:08:26.487
and it was splattering oil
out its blowhole.

00:08:27.938 --> 00:08:32.653
And he moved away
because it was his last fishing trip,

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:35.976
and he knew that the dolphins scare fish.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.884
So he moved away from it,
turned around a few minutes later,

00:08:39.908 --> 00:08:42.155
it was right next to the side
of the boat again.

00:08:42.179 --> 00:08:45.600
He said that in 30 years of fishing
he had never seen a dolphin do that.

00:08:45.624 --> 00:08:47.185
And he felt that --

00:08:47.693 --> 00:08:48.896
(Sigh)

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.581
he felt that it was
coming to ask for help.

00:08:52.938 --> 00:08:54.088
Sorry.

00:08:55.392 --> 00:08:59.346
Now, in the Exxon Valdez spill,

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:04.614
about 30 percent of the killer whales
died in the first few months.

00:09:04.638 --> 00:09:06.558
Their numbers have never recovered.

00:09:06.582 --> 00:09:11.447
So the recovery rate of all this stuff
is going to be variable.

00:09:11.471 --> 00:09:14.296
It's going to take longer for some things.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.908
And some things, I think,
will probably come back a little faster.

00:09:18.273 --> 00:09:20.976
The other thing about the Gulf
that is important

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.465
is that there are a lot of animals
that concentrate in the Gulf

00:09:24.489 --> 00:09:27.025
at certain parts of the year.

00:09:27.822 --> 00:09:30.429
So the Gulf is a really
important piece of water --

00:09:30.453 --> 00:09:35.363
more important than a similar volume
of water in the open Atlantic Ocean.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.976
These tuna swim the entire ocean.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.773
They get in the Gulf Stream,
they go all the way to Europe.

00:09:40.797 --> 00:09:42.965
When it comes time to spawn,
they come inside,

00:09:42.989 --> 00:09:44.714
and these two tuna that were tagged,

00:09:44.738 --> 00:09:46.838
you can see them on the spawning grounds

00:09:46.862 --> 00:09:49.567
very much right in the area of the slick.

00:09:49.591 --> 00:09:52.076
They're probably having,
at the very least,

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:54.853
a catastrophic spawning season this year.

00:09:54.877 --> 00:09:58.371
I'm hoping that maybe the adults
are avoiding that dirty water.

00:09:58.717 --> 00:10:02.759
They don't usually like to go into water
that is very cloudy anyway.

00:10:03.148 --> 00:10:06.940
But these are really
high-performance athletic animals.

00:10:06.964 --> 00:10:10.206
I don't know what this kind of stuff
will do in their gills.

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:12.176
I don't know if it'll affect the adults.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.017
If it's not, it's certainly affecting
their eggs and larvae,

00:10:15.041 --> 00:10:16.228
I would certainly think.

00:10:16.252 --> 00:10:19.595
But if you look at that graph
that goes down and down and down,

00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:24.340
that's what we've done to this species
through overfishing over many decades.

00:10:24.364 --> 00:10:29.521
So while the oil spill, the leak,
the eruption, is a catastrophe,

00:10:29.545 --> 00:10:32.278
I think it's important to keep in mind

00:10:32.302 --> 00:10:36.418
that we've done a lot to affect
what's in the ocean, for a very long time.

00:10:36.442 --> 00:10:39.780
It's not like we're starting
with something that's been OK.

00:10:39.804 --> 00:10:42.540
We're starting with something
that's had a lot of stresses

00:10:42.564 --> 00:10:44.426
and a lot of problems to begin with.

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:48.476
If you look around at the birds,
there are a lot of birds in the Gulf

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.267
that concentrate in the Gulf
at certain times of the year,

00:10:51.291 --> 00:10:52.575
but then leave.

00:10:52.599 --> 00:10:55.671
And they populate much larger areas.

00:10:57.387 --> 00:11:01.577
For instance, most of the birds
in this picture are migratory birds.

00:11:01.601 --> 00:11:03.443
They were all on the Gulf in May,

00:11:03.467 --> 00:11:06.584
while oil was starting
to come ashore in certain places.

00:11:06.608 --> 00:11:11.163
Down on the lower left there
are ruddy turnstones and sanderlings.

00:11:11.187 --> 00:11:12.910
They breed in the High Arctic,

00:11:12.934 --> 00:11:15.496
and they winter
down in southern South America.

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:20.331
But they concentrate in the Gulf
and then fan out all across the Arctic.

00:11:20.355 --> 00:11:23.481
I saw birds that breed
in Greenland, in the Gulf.

00:11:24.852 --> 00:11:28.263
So this is a hemispheric issue.

00:11:28.287 --> 00:11:33.083
The economic effects
go at least nationally in many ways.

00:11:33.107 --> 00:11:36.174
The biological effects
are certainly hemispheric.

00:11:38.867 --> 00:11:44.060
I think that this is one of the most
absolutely mind-boggling examples

00:11:44.084 --> 00:11:46.896
of total unpreparedness
that I can even think of.

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:50.818
Even when the Japanese
bombed Pearl Harbor,

00:11:50.842 --> 00:11:52.249
at least they shot back.

00:11:52.273 --> 00:11:56.356
And we just seem to be unable
to figure out what to do.

00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:00.016
There was nothing ready,

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.430
and, you know, as we can see
by what they're doing.

00:12:03.454 --> 00:12:06.218
Mainly what they're doing
is booms and dispersants.

00:12:06.242 --> 00:12:09.994
The booms are absolutely
not made for open water.

00:12:10.018 --> 00:12:14.859
They don't even attempt to corral
the oil where it is most concentrated.

00:12:14.883 --> 00:12:17.117
They get near shore --
Look at these two boats.

00:12:17.141 --> 00:12:19.765
That one on the right
is called Fishing Fool.

00:12:19.789 --> 00:12:21.799
And I think, you know, that's a great name

00:12:21.823 --> 00:12:24.881
for boats that think
that they're going to do anything

00:12:24.905 --> 00:12:27.977
to make a dent in this,
by dragging a boom between them

00:12:28.001 --> 00:12:30.965
when there are literally
hundreds of thousands of square miles

00:12:30.989 --> 00:12:33.870
in the Gulf right now
with oil at the surface.

00:12:33.894 --> 00:12:37.644
The dispersants make the oil
go right under the booms.

00:12:37.668 --> 00:12:41.032
The booms are only
about 13 inches in diameter.

00:12:41.867 --> 00:12:44.893
So it's just absolutely crazy.

00:12:44.917 --> 00:12:46.611
Here are shrimp boats employed.

00:12:46.635 --> 00:12:50.576
There are hundreds of shrimp boats
employed to drag booms instead of nets.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.923
Here they are working.

00:12:51.947 --> 00:12:53.744
You can see easily

00:12:53.768 --> 00:12:57.663
that all the oily water
just goes over the back of the boom.

00:12:57.687 --> 00:12:59.637
All they're doing is stirring it.

00:12:59.661 --> 00:13:01.259
It's just ridiculous.

00:13:03.104 --> 00:13:05.209
Also, for all the shoreline
that has booms --

00:13:05.233 --> 00:13:07.404
hundreds and hundreds
of miles of shoreline --

00:13:07.428 --> 00:13:09.209
all of the shoreline that has booms,

00:13:09.233 --> 00:13:11.919
there's adjacent shoreline
that doesn't have any booms.

00:13:11.943 --> 00:13:16.976
There is ample opportunity for oil
and dirty water to get in behind them.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.823
And that lower photo,
that's a bird colony that has been boomed.

00:13:20.847 --> 00:13:25.416
Everybody's trying to protect
the bird colonies there.

00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:30.671
Well, as an ornithologist,
I can tell you that birds fly, and that --

00:13:30.695 --> 00:13:33.000
(Laughter)

00:13:35.671 --> 00:13:40.976
and that booming a bird colony
doesn't do it; it doesn't do it.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.520
These birds make a living
by diving into the water.

00:13:45.623 --> 00:13:46.773
In fact ...

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:51.283
really what I think
they should do, if anything --

00:13:51.307 --> 00:13:54.444
they're trying so hard
to protect those nests --

00:13:54.468 --> 00:13:57.141
actually, if they destroyed
every single nest,

00:13:57.165 --> 00:13:59.201
some of the birds would leave,

00:13:59.225 --> 00:14:01.530
and that would be better
for them this year.

00:14:02.415 --> 00:14:03.948
As far as cleaning them ...

00:14:05.001 --> 00:14:09.934
I don't mean to cast any aspersion
on people cleaning birds.

00:14:09.958 --> 00:14:13.858
It's really, really important
that we express our compassion.

00:14:13.882 --> 00:14:17.422
I think that's the most important
thing that people have, is compassion.

00:14:18.026 --> 00:14:21.976
It's really important
to get those images and to show it.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.375
But really, where are those birds
going to get released to?

00:14:25.399 --> 00:14:27.844
It's like taking somebody
out of a burning building,

00:14:27.868 --> 00:14:29.508
treating them for smoke inhalation

00:14:29.532 --> 00:14:33.285
and sending them back into the building,
because the oil is still gushing.

00:14:33.686 --> 00:14:37.578
I refuse to acknowledge this
as anything like an accident.

00:14:37.602 --> 00:14:41.189
I think that this is the result
of gross negligence.

00:14:41.213 --> 00:14:45.976
(Applause)

00:14:46.348 --> 00:14:48.631
Not just BP.

00:14:48.655 --> 00:14:55.312
BP operated very sloppily
and very recklessly because they could.

00:14:55.336 --> 00:14:57.283
And they were allowed to do so

00:14:57.307 --> 00:15:01.700
because of the absolute failure
of oversight of the government

00:15:01.724 --> 00:15:06.049
that is supposed to be
our government, protecting us.

00:15:08.305 --> 00:15:09.814
It turns out that --

00:15:09.838 --> 00:15:13.069
you see this sign on every commercial
vessel in the United States --

00:15:13.093 --> 00:15:15.695
you know, if you spilled
a couple of gallons of oil,

00:15:15.719 --> 00:15:17.098
you would be in big trouble.

00:15:17.122 --> 00:15:21.729
And you have to really wonder
who are the laws made for,

00:15:21.753 --> 00:15:25.425
and who has gotten above the laws.

00:15:25.449 --> 00:15:27.800
And there are things
that we can do in the future.

00:15:27.824 --> 00:15:30.876
We could have the kinds of equipment
that we would really need.

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:33.503
It would not take
an awful lot to anticipate

00:15:33.876 --> 00:15:36.271
that after making 30,000 holes

00:15:36.295 --> 00:15:39.120
in the sea floor of the Gulf
of Mexico looking for oil,

00:15:39.144 --> 00:15:41.537
oil might start coming out of one of them.

00:15:41.561 --> 00:15:44.721
And you'd have some idea of what to do.

00:15:44.745 --> 00:15:47.036
That's certainly
one of the things we need to do.

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:51.109
But I think we have to understand
where this leak really started from.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.347
It really started from the destruction
of the idea that the government is there

00:15:57.371 --> 00:15:59.086
because it's our government,

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:01.994
meant to protect
the larger public interest.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.960
So I think that the oil blowout,
the bank bailout,

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:17.305
the mortgage crisis and all these things
are absolutely symptoms of the same cause.

00:16:18.236 --> 00:16:21.105
We still seem to understand that at least,

00:16:21.129 --> 00:16:25.519
we need the police to protect us
from a few bad people.

00:16:25.543 --> 00:16:28.546
And even though the police
can be a little annoying at times --

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:30.481
giving us tickets and stuff like that --

00:16:30.505 --> 00:16:33.030
nobody says that we should
just get rid of them.

00:16:33.054 --> 00:16:35.976
But in the entire rest
of government right now

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.862
and for the last at least 30 years,

00:16:37.886 --> 00:16:40.976
there has been a culture of deregulation

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.406
that is caused directly by the people
who we need to be protected from,

00:16:46.954 --> 00:16:49.477
buying the government out from under us.

00:16:50.263 --> 00:16:57.263
(Applause)

00:16:59.921 --> 00:17:02.727
Now this has been a problem
for a very, very long time.

00:17:03.165 --> 00:17:08.524
You can see that corporations were illegal
at the founding of America,

00:17:08.548 --> 00:17:11.256
and even Thomas Jefferson complained

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:16.896
that they were already bidding defiance
to the laws of our country.

00:17:18.162 --> 00:17:21.057
OK, people who say they're conservative,

00:17:21.691 --> 00:17:26.504
if they really wanted to be
really conservative and patriotic,

00:17:26.528 --> 00:17:29.572
they would tell
these corporations to go to hell.

00:17:30.183 --> 00:17:33.000
That's what it would really mean
to be conservative.

00:17:33.807 --> 00:17:38.505
So what we really need to do
is regain the idea

00:17:38.529 --> 00:17:41.744
that it's our government
safeguarding our interests,

00:17:41.768 --> 00:17:45.976
and regain a sense of unity
and common cause in our country

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.629
that really has been lost.

00:17:48.932 --> 00:17:50.862
I think there are signs of hope.

00:17:50.886 --> 00:17:52.976
We seem to be waking up a little bit.

00:17:53.415 --> 00:17:56.427
The Glass-Steagall Act --
which was really to protect us

00:17:56.451 --> 00:17:59.477
from the kind of thing
that caused the recession to happen,

00:17:59.501 --> 00:18:03.193
and the bank meltdown and all that stuff
that required the bailouts --

00:18:03.217 --> 00:18:07.432
that was put in effect in 1933,
was systematically destroyed.

00:18:07.937 --> 00:18:11.674
Now there's a mood to put
some of that stuff back in place,

00:18:11.698 --> 00:18:16.219
but the lobbyists are already there
trying to weaken the regulations

00:18:16.243 --> 00:18:18.976
after the legislation has just passed.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.976
So it's a continued fight.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.048
It's a historic moment right now.

00:18:23.072 --> 00:18:27.085
We're either going to have an absolutely
unmitigated catastrophe

00:18:27.109 --> 00:18:28.746
of this oil leak in the Gulf,

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:31.416
or we will make the moment
we need out of this,

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.107
as many people have noted today.

00:18:33.131 --> 00:18:34.787
There's certainly a common theme

00:18:34.811 --> 00:18:37.218
about needing to make
the moment out of this.

00:18:37.242 --> 00:18:41.257
We've been through this before
with other ways of offshore drilling.

00:18:41.281 --> 00:18:43.976
The first offshore wells
were called whales.

00:18:44.305 --> 00:18:47.163
The first offshore drills
were called harpoons.

00:18:47.187 --> 00:18:49.976
We emptied the ocean
of the whales at that time.

00:18:50.735 --> 00:18:52.431
Now are we stuck with this?

00:18:52.455 --> 00:18:56.367
Ever since we lived in caves,
every time we wanted any energy,

00:18:56.391 --> 00:18:59.942
we lit something on fire,
and that is still what we're doing.

00:18:59.966 --> 00:19:04.160
We're still lighting something on fire
every time we want energy.

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:08.075
And people say we can't have clean energy

00:19:08.099 --> 00:19:10.411
because it's too expensive.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.772
Who says it's too expensive?

00:19:12.796 --> 00:19:15.054
People who sell us fossil fuels.

00:19:15.078 --> 00:19:17.976
We've been here before with energy,

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.101
and people saying the economy
cannot withstand a switch,

00:19:22.125 --> 00:19:25.337
because the cheapest energy was slavery.

00:19:25.361 --> 00:19:28.118
Energy is always a moral issue.

00:19:28.142 --> 00:19:30.407
It's an issue that is moral right now.

00:19:30.431 --> 00:19:32.974
It's a matter of right and wrong.

00:19:32.998 --> 00:19:34.166
Thank you very much.

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:35.563
(Applause)
