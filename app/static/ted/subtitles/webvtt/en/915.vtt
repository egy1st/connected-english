00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
When I was a student here in Oxford in the 1970s,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
the future of the world was bleak.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The population explosion was unstoppable.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Global famine was inevitable.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
A cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environment

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
was going to shorten our lives.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The acid rain was falling on the forests.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The desert was advancing by a mile or two a year.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The oil was running out,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and a nuclear winter would finish us off.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
None of those things happened,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
(Laughter)

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and astonishingly, if you look at what actually happened in my lifetime,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
the average per-capita income

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
of the average person on the planet,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
in real terms, adjusted for inflation,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
has tripled.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Lifespan is up by 30 percent in my lifetime.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Child mortality is down by two-thirds.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Per-capita food production

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
is up by a third.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And all this at a time when the population has doubled.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
How did we achieve that, whether you think it's a good thing or not?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
How did we achieve that?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
How did we become

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
the only species

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
that becomes more prosperous

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
as it becomes more populous?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
The size of the blob in this graph represents the size of the population,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and the level of the graph

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
represents GDP per capita.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I think to answer that question

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
you need to understand

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
how human beings bring together their brains

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and enable their ideas to combine and recombine,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
to meet and, indeed, to mate.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
In other words, you need to understand

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
how ideas have sex.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
I want you to imagine

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
how we got from making objects like this

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
to making objects like this.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
These are both real objects.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
One is an Acheulean hand axe from half a million years ago

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
of the kind made by Homo erectus.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
The other is obviously a computer mouse.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
They're both exactly the same size and shape to an uncanny degree.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I've tried to work out which is bigger,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and it's almost impossible.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And that's because they're both designed to fit the human hand.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
They're both technologies. In the end, their similarity is not that interesting.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
It just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
The differences are what interest me,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
because the one on the left was made to a pretty unvarying design

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
for about a million years --

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
from one-and-a-half million years ago to half a million years ago.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Homo erectus made the same tool

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
for 30,000 generations.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Of course there were a few changes,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
but tools changed slower than skeletons in those days.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
There was no progress, no innovation.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
It's an extraordinary phenomenon, but it's true.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Whereas the object on the right is obsolete after five years.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And there's another difference too,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
which is the object on the left is made from one substance.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
The object on the right is made from

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
a confection of different substances,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
from silicon and metal and plastic and so on.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And more than that, it's a confection of different ideas,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
the idea of plastic, the idea of a laser,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
the idea of transistors.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
They've all been combined together in this technology.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And it's this combination,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
this cumulative technology, that intrigues me,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
because I think it's the secret to understanding

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
what's happening in the world.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
My body's an accumulation of ideas too:

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
the idea of skin cells, the idea of brain cells, the idea of liver cells.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
They've come together.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
How does evolution do cumulative, combinatorial things?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Well, it uses sexual reproduction.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
In an asexual species, if you get two different mutations in different creatures,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
a green one and a red one,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
then one has to be better than the other.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
One goes extinct for the other to survive.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
But if you have a sexual species,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
then it's possible for an individual

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
to inherit both mutations

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
from different lineages.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
So what sex does is it enables the individual

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
to draw upon

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
the genetic innovations of the whole species.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
It's not confined to its own lineage.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
What's the process that's having the same effect

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
in cultural evolution

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
as sex is having in biological evolution?

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And I think the answer is exchange,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
the habit of exchanging one thing for another.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
It's a unique human feature.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
No other animal does it.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
You can teach them in the laboratory to do a little bit of exchange --

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
and indeed there's reciprocity in other animals --

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
But the exchange of one object for another never happens.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
As Adam Smith said, "No man ever saw a dog

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
make a fair exchange of a bone with another dog."

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
(Laughter)

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
You can have culture without exchange.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
You can have, as it were, asexual culture.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Chimpanzees, killer whales, these kinds of creatures, they have culture.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
They teach each other traditions

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
which are handed down from parent to offspring.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
In this case, chimpanzees teaching each other

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
how to crack nuts with rocks.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
But the difference is

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
that these cultures never expand, never grow,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
never accumulate, never become combinatorial,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
and the reason is because

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
there is no sex, as it were,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
there is no exchange of ideas.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Chimpanzee troops have different cultures in different troops.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
There's no exchange of ideas between them.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
And why does exchange raise living standards?

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Well, the answer came from David Ricardo in 1817.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And here is a Stone Age version of his story,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
although he told it in terms of trade between countries.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Adam takes four hours to make a spear and three hours to make an axe.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Oz takes one hour to make a spear and two hours to make an axe.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
So Oz is better at both spears and axes than Adam.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
He doesn't need Adam.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
He can make his own spears and axes.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Well no, because if you think about it,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
if Oz makes two spears and Adam make two axes,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
and then they trade,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
then they will each have saved an hour of work.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
And the more they do this, the more true it's going to be,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
because the more they do this, the better Adam is going to get at making axes

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
and the better Oz is going to get at making spears.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
So the gains from trade are only going to grow.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
And this is one of the beauties of exchange,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
is it actually creates the momentum

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
for more specialization,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
which creates the momentum for more exchange and so on.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Adam and Oz both saved an hour of time.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
That is prosperity, the saving of time

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
in satisfying your needs.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Ask yourself how long you would have to work

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
to provide for yourself

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
an hour of reading light this evening to read a book by.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
If you had to start from scratch, let's say you go out into the countryside.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
You find a sheep. You kill it. You get the fat out of it.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
You render it down. You make a candle, etc. etc.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
How long is it going to take you? Quite a long time.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
How long do you actually have to work

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
to earn an hour of reading light

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
if you're on the average wage in Britain today?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And the answer is about half a second.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Back in 1950,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
you would have had to work for eight seconds on the average wage

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
to acquire that much light.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
And that's seven and a half seconds of prosperity that you've gained

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
since 1950, as it were,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
because that's seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
or you can acquire another good or service.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And back in 1880,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
it would have been 15 minutes

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
to earn that amount of light on the average wage.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Back in 1800,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
you'd have had to work six hours

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
to earn a candle that could burn for an hour.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
In other words, the average person on the average wage

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
could not afford a candle in 1800.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Go back to this image of the axe and the mouse,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
and ask yourself: "Who made them and for who?"

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
The stone axe was made by someone for himself.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
It was self-sufficiency.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
We call that poverty these days.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
But the object on the right

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
was made for me by other people.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
How many other people?

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Tens? Hundreds? Thousands?

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
You know, I think it's probably millions.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Because you've got to include the man who grew the coffee,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
which was brewed for the man who was on the oil rig,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
who was drilling for oil, which was going to be made into the plastic, etc.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
They were all working for me,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
to make a mouse for me.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
And that's the way society works.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
That's what we've achieved as a species.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
In the old days, if you were rich,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
you literally had people working for you.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
That's how you got to be rich; you employed them.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Louis XIV had a lot of people working for him.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
They made his silly outfits, like this,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
(Laughter)

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
and they did his silly hairstyles, or whatever.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
He had 498 people

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
to prepare his dinner every night.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
But a modern tourist going around the palace of Versailles

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
and looking at Louis XIV's pictures,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
he has 498 people doing his dinner tonight too.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
They're in bistros and cafes and restaurants

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
and shops all over Paris,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
and they're all ready to serve you at an hour's notice with an excellent meal

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
that's probably got higher quality

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
than Louis XIV even had.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
And that's what we've done, because we're all working for each other.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
We're able to draw upon specialization and exchange

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
to raise each other's living standards.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Now, you do get other animals working for each other too.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Ants are a classic example; workers work for queens and queens work for workers.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
But there's a big difference,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
which is that it only happens within the colony.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
There's no working for each other across the colonies.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And the reason for that is because there's a reproductive division of labor.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
That is to say, they specialize with respect to reproduction.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
The queen does it all.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
In our species, we don't like doing that.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
It's the one thing we insist on doing for ourselves, is reproduction.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
(Laughter)

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Even in England, we don't leave reproduction to the Queen.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
(Applause)

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
So when did this habit start?

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
And how long has it been going on? And what does it mean?

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Well, I think, probably, the oldest version of this

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
is probably the sexual division of labor.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
But I've got no evidence for that.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
It just looks like the first thing we did

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
was work male for female and female for male.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
In all hunter-gatherer societies today,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
there's a foraging division of labor

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
between, on the whole, hunting males and gathering females.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
It isn't always quite that simple,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
but there's a distinction between

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
specialized roles for males and females.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
And the beauty of this system

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
is that it benefits both sides.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
The woman knows

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
that, in the Hadzas' case here --

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
digging roots to share with men in exchange for meat --

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
she knows that all she has to do to get access to protein

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
is to dig some extra roots and trade them for meat.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
And she doesn't have to go on an exhausting hunt

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
and try and kill a warthog.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
And the man knows that he doesn't have to do any digging

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
to get roots.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
All he has to do is make sure that when he kills a warthog

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
it's big enough to share some.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
And so both sides raise each other's standards of living

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
through the sexual division of labor.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
When did this happen? We don't know, but it's possible

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
that Neanderthals didn't do this.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
They were a highly cooperative species.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
They were a highly intelligent species.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Their brains on average, by the end, were bigger than yours and mine

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
in this room today.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
They were imaginative. They buried their dead.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
They had language, probably,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
because we know they had the FOXP2 gene of the same kind as us,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
which was discovered here in Oxford.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
And so it looks like they probably had linguistic skills.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
They were brilliant people. I'm not dissing the Neanderthals.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
But there's no evidence

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
of a sexual division of labor.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
There's no evidence of gathering behavior by females.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
It looks like the females were cooperative hunters with the men.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
And the other thing there's no evidence for

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
is exchange between groups,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
because the objects that you find in Neanderthal remains,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
the tools they made,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
are always made from local materials.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
For example, in the Caucasus

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
there's a site where you find local Neanderthal tools.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
They're always made from local chert.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
In the same valley there are modern human remains

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
from about the same date, 30,000 years ago,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
and some of those are from local chert,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
but more -- but many of them are made

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
from obsidian from a long way away.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
And when human beings began

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
moving objects around like this,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
it was evidence that they were exchanging between groups.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Trade is 10 times as old as farming.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
People forget that. People think of trade as a modern thing.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Exchange between groups has been going on

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
for a hundred thousand years.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And the earliest evidence for it crops up

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
somewhere between 80 and 120,000 years ago in Africa,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
when you see obsidian and jasper and other things

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
moving long distances in Ethiopia.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
You also see seashells --

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
as discovered by a team here in Oxford --

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
moving 125 miles inland

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
from the Mediterranean in Algeria.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
And that's evidence that people

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
have started exchanging between groups.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
And that will have led to specialization.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
How do you know that long-distance movement

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
means trade rather than migration?

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Well, you look at modern hunter gatherers like aboriginals,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
who quarried for stone axes at a place called Mount Isa,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
which was a quarry owned by the Kalkadoon tribe.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
They traded them with their neighbors

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
for things like stingray barbs,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
and the consequence was that stone axes

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
ended up over a large part of Australia.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
So long-distance movement of tools

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
is a sign of trade, not migration.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
What happens when you cut people off from exchange,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
from the ability to exchange and specialize?

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
And the answer is that

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
not only do you slow down technological progress,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
you can actually throw it into reverse.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
An example is Tasmania.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
When the sea level rose and Tasmania became an island 10,000 years ago,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
the people on it not only experienced

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
slower progress than people on the mainland,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
they actually experienced regress.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
They gave up the ability to make stone tools

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
and fishing equipment and clothing

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
because the population of about 4,000 people

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
was simply not large enough

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
to maintain the specialized skills

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
necessary to keep the technology they had.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
It's as if the people in this room were plonked on a desert island.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
How many of the things in our pockets

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
could we continue to make after 10,000 years?

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
It didn't happen in Tierra del Fuego --

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
similar island, similar people.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
The reason: because Tierra del Fuego

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
is separated from South America by a much narrower straight,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
and there was trading contact across that straight

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
throughout 10,000 years.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
The Tasmanians were isolated.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Go back to this image again

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
and ask yourself, not only who made it and for who,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
but who knew how to make it.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
In the case of the stone axe, the man who made it knew how to make it.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
But who knows how to make a computer mouse?

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Nobody, literally nobody.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
There is nobody on the planet who knows how to make a computer mouse.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
I mean this quite seriously.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
The president of the computer mouse company doesn't know.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
He just knows how to run a company.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
The person on the assembly line doesn't know

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
because he doesn't know how to drill an oil well

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
to get oil out to make plastic, and so on.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
We all know little bits, but none of us knows the whole.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
I am of course quoting from a famous essay

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
by Leonard Read, the economist in the 1950s,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
called "I, Pencil"

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
in which he wrote about how a pencil came to be made,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
and how nobody knows even how to make a pencil,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
because the people who assemble it don't know how to mine graphite,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
and they don't know how to fell trees and that kind of thing.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
And what we've done in human society,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
through exchange and specialization,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
is we've created

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
the ability to do things that we don't even understand.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
It's not the same with language.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
With language we have to transfer ideas

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
that we understand with each other.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
But with technology,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
we can actually do things that are beyond our capabilities.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
We've gone beyond the capacity of the human mind

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
to an extraordinary degree.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
And by the way,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
that's one of the reasons that I'm not interested

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
in the debate about I.Q.,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
about whether some groups have higher I.Q.s than other groups.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
It's completely irrelevant.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
What's relevant to a society

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
is how well people are communicating their ideas,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
and how well they're cooperating,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
not how clever the individuals are.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
So we've created something called the collective brain.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
We're just the nodes in the network.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
We're the neurons in this brain.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
It's the interchange of ideas,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
the meeting and mating of ideas between them,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
that is causing technological progress,

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
incrementally, bit by bit.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
However, bad things happen.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
And in the future, as we go forward,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
we will, of course, experience terrible things.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
There will be wars; there will be depressions;

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
there will be natural disasters.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Awful things will happen in this century, I'm absolutely sure.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
But I'm also sure that, because of the connections people are making,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
and the ability of ideas

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
to meet and to mate

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
as never before,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
I'm also sure

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
that technology will advance,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
and therefore living standards will advance.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Because through the cloud,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
through crowd sourcing,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
through the bottom-up world that we've created,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
where not just the elites but everybody

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
is able to have their ideas

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
and make them meet and mate,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
we are surely accelerating the rate of innovation.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
Thank you.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000
(Applause)
