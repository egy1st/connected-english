00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm an American, which means, generally,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I ignore football unless it involves

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
guys my size or Bruno's size

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
running into each other at extremely high speeds.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
That said, it's been really hard

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
to ignore football

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
for the last couple of weeks.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I go onto Twitter, there are all these strange words that I've never heard before:

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
FIFA, vuvuzela,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
weird jokes about octopi.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
But the one that's really been sort of stressing me out,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that I haven't been able to figure out,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
is this phrase "Cala a boca, Galvao."

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
If you've gone onto Twitter in the last couple of weeks,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
you've probably seen this.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
It's been a major trending topic.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Being a monolingual American, I obviously don't know what the phrase means.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So I went onto Twitter,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and I asked some people if they could explain to me "Cala a boca, Galvao."

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And fortunately, my Brazilian friends

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
were more than ready to help.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
They explained that the Galvao bird

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
is a rare and endangered parrot

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
that's in terrible, terrible danger.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
In fact, I'll let them tell you a bit more about it.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Narrator: A word about Galvao, a very rare kind of bird

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
native to Brazil.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Every year, more than 300,000 Galvao birds

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
are killed during Carnival parades.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Ethan Zuckerman: Obviously, this is a tragic situation,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and it actually gets worse.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
It turns out that, not only is the Galvao parrot

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
very attractive, useful for headdresses,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
it evidently has certain hallucinogenic properties,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
which means that there's a terrible problem

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
with Galvao abuse.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Some sick and twisted people have found themselves snorting Galvao.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
And it's terribly endangered.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
The good news about this is that the global community --

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
again, my Brazilian friends tell me --

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
is pitching in to help out.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
It turns out that Lady Gaga

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
has released a new single --

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
actually five or six new singles, as near as I can tell --

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
titled "Cala a boca, Galvao."

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And my Brazilian friends tell me that

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
if I just tweet the phrase "Cala a boca, Galvao,"

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
10 cents will be given

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
to a global campaign

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
to save this rare and beautiful bird.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Now, most of you have figured out that this was a prank,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and actually a very, very good one.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
"Cala a boca, Galvao" actually means something very different.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
In Portugese, it means "Shut your mouth, Galvao."

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And it specifically refers to this guy, Galvao Bueno,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
who's the lead soccer commentator

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
for Rede Globo.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And what I understand from my Brazilian friends

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
is that this guy is just a cliche machine.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
He can ruin the most interesting match

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
by just spouting cliche again and again and again.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
So Brazilians went to that first match

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
against North Korea,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
put up this banner, started a Twitter campaign

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and tried to convince the rest of us

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
to tweet the phrase: "Cala a boca, Galvao."

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And in fact, were so successful at this

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
that it topped Twitter for two weeks.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Now there's a couple --

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
there's a couple of lessons that you can take from this.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And the first lesson, which I think is a worthwhile one,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
is that you cannot go wrong

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
asking people to be active online,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
so long as activism just means retweeting a phrase.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So as long as activism is that simple,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
it's pretty easy to get away with.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
The other thing you can take from this, by the way,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
is that there are a lot of Brazilians on Twitter.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
There's more than five million of them.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
As far as national representation,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
11 percent of Brazilian internet users are on Twitter.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
That's a much higher number than in the U.S. or U.K.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Next to Japan,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
it's the second most represented by population.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Now if you're using Twitter or other social networks,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and you didn't realize

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
this was a space with a lot of Brazilians in it,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
you're like most of us.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Because what happens on a social network

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
is you interact with the people

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
that you have chosen to interact with.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And if you are like me, a big, geeky, white, American guy,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
you tend to interact with a lot of other geeky, white, American guys.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And you don't necessarily have the sense

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
that Twitter is in fact a very heavily Brazilian space.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
It's also extremely surprising to many Americans,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
a heavily African-American space.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Twitter recently did some research.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
They looked at their local population.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
They believe that 24 percent

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
of American Twitter users are African-American.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
That's about twice as high as African-Americans

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
are represented in the population.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And again, that was very shocking to many Twitter users,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
but it shouldn't be.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
And the reason it shouldn't be is that on any day

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
you can go into Trending Topics.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And you tend to find topics

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
that are almost entirely African-American conversations.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
This was a visualization done by Fernando Viegas

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
and Martin Wattenberg,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
two amazing visualization designers,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
who looked at

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
a weekend's worth of Twitter traffic

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
and essentially found that a lot of these trending topics

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
were basically segregated conversations --

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
and in ways that you wouldn't expect.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
It turns out that oil spill is a mostly white conversation,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
that cookout

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
is a mostly black conversation.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And what's crazy about this is that

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
if you wanted to mix up who you were seeing on Twitter,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
it's literally a quick click away.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
You click on that cookout tag, there an entirely different conversation

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
with different people participating in it.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
But generally speaking, most of us don't.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
We end up within these filter bubbles, as my friend Eli Pariser calls them,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
where we see the people we already know

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
and the people who are similar to the people we already know.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
And we tend not to see that wider picture.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Now for me, I'm surprised by this,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
because this wasn't how the internet was supposed to be.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
If you go back into the early days of the internet,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
when cyber-utopians like Nick Negroponte

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
were writing big books like "Being Digital,"

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
the prediction was that the internet

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
was going to be an incredibly powerful force

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
to smooth out cultural differences,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
to put us all on a common field of one fashion or another.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Negroponte started his book with a story

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
about how hard it is to build connections

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
in the world of atoms.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
He's at a technology conference in Florida.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And he's looking at something really, truly absurd,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
which is bottles of Evian water on the table.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And Negroponte says this is crazy.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
This is the old economy.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
It's the economy of moving these

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
heavy, slow atoms over long distances that's very difficult to do.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
We're heading to the future of bits,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
where everything is speedy, it's weightless.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
It can be anywhere in the world at any time.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
And it's going to change the world as we know it.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Now, Negroponte has been right about a lot of things.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
He's totally wrong about this one.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
It turns out that in many cases

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
atoms are much more mobile than bits.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
If I walk into a store in the United States,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
it's very, very easy for me to buy water

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
that's bottled in Fiji,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
shipped at great expense to the United States.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
It's actually surprisingly hard

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
for me to see a Fijian feature film.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
It's really difficult for me to listen to Fijian music.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
It's extremely difficult for me to get Fijian news,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
which is strange, because actually there's an enormous amount going on in Fiji.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
There's a coup government. There's a military government.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
There's crackdowns on the press.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
It's actually a place that we probably should

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
be paying attention to at the moment.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Here's what I think is going on.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
I think that we tend to look a lot

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
at the infrastructure

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
of globalization.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
We look at the framework that makes it possible

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
to live in this connected world.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
And that's a framework that includes things like airline routes.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
It includes things like the Internet cables.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
We look at a map like this one,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
and it looks like the entire world is flat

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
because everything is a hop or two away.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
You can get on a flight in London,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
you can end up in Bangalore later today.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Two hops, you're in Suva, the capitol of Fiji.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
It's all right there.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
When you start looking at what actually

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
flows on top of these networks,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
you get a very different picture.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
You start looking at how

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
the global plane flights move,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
and you suddenly discover that the world isn't even close to flat.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
It's extremely lumpy.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
There are parts of the world that are very, very well connected.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
There's basically a giant pathway in the sky

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
between London and New York.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
but look at this map, and you can watch this

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
for, you know, two or three minutes.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
You won't see very many planes

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
go from South America to Africa.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
And you'll discover that there are parts of the globe

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
that are systematically cut off.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
When we stop looking at the infrastructure that makes connection possible,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
and we look at what actually happens,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
we start realizing that the world doesn't work quite the same way

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
that we think it does.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
So here's the problem that I've been interested in

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
in the last decade or so.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
The world is, in fact, getting more global.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
It's getting more connected.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
More of problems are global in scale.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
More of our economics is global in scale.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And our media is less global by the day.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
If you watched a television broadcast in the United States in the 1970s,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
35 to 40 percent of it would have been international news

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
on a nightly new broadcast.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
That's down to about 12 to 15 percent.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
And this tends to give us a very distorted view of the world.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Here's a slide that Alisa Miller showed at a previous TED Talk.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Alisa's the president of Public Radio International.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
And she made a cartogram, which is basically a distorted map

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
based on what American

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
television news casts

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
looked at for a month.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
And you see that when you distort a map based on attention,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
the world within American television news

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
is basically reduced to

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
this giant bloated U.S.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
and a couple of other countries which we've invaded.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
And that's basically what our media is about.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
And before you conclude that this is just a function of American TV news --

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
which is dreadful, and I agree that it's dreadful --

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
I've been mapping elite media like the New York Times,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
and I get the same thing.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
When you look at the New York Times, you look at other elite media,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
what you largely get are pictures of very wealthy nations

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
and the nations we've invaded.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
It turns out that new media

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
isn't necessarily helping us all that much.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Here's a map made by Mark Graham

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
who's down the street at the Oxford Internet Institute.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
A this is a map of articles in Wikipedia

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
that have been geo-coded.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
And you'll notice that there's a very heavy bias

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
towards North America and Western Europe.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Even within Wikipedias,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
where we're creating their own content online,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
there's a heavy bias towards the place where

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
a lot of the Wikipedia authors are based,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
rather than to the rest of the world.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
In the U.K., you can get up,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
you can pick up your computer when you get out of this session,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
you could read a newspaper from India or from Australia,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
from Canada, God forbid from the U.S.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
You probably won't.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
If you look at online media consumption --

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
in this case, in the top 10 users of the internet --

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
more than 95 percent of the news readership

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
is on domestic news sites.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
It's one of these rare cases where the U.S. is actually slightly better than [the U.K.],

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
because we actually like reading your media,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
rather than vice versa.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
So all of this starts leading me

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
to think that we're in a state that I refer to

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
as imaginary cosmopolitanism.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
We look at the internet.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
We think we're getting this wide view of the globe.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
We occasionally stumble onto a page in Chinese,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
and we decide that we do in fact have the greatest technology ever built

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
to connect us to the rest of the world.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
And we forget that most of the time

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
we're checking Boston Red Sox scores.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
So this is a real problem --

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
not just because the Red Sox are having a bad year --

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
but it's a real problem because,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
as we're discussing here at TED,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
the real problems in the world

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
the interesting problems to solve

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
are global in scale and scope,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
they require global conversations

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
to get to global solutions.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
This is a problem we have to solve.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
So here's the good news.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
For six years, I've been hanging out with these guys.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
This is a group called Global Voices.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
This is a team of bloggers from around the world.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Our mission was to fix the world's media.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
We started in 2004.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
You might have noticed, we haven't done all that well so far.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Nor do I think we are by ourselves,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
actually going to solve the problem.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
But the more that I think about it, the more that I think

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
that a few things that we have learned along the way

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
are interesting lessons for how we would rewire

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
if we we wanted to use the web to have a wider world.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
The first thing you have to consider

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
is that there are parts of the world

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
that are dark spots in terms of attention.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
In this case -- the map of the world at night by NASA --

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
they're dark literally because of lack of electricity.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
And I used to think that a dark spot on this map

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
basically meant you're not going to get media from there

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
because there are more basic needs.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
What I'm starting to realize is that

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
you can get media, it's just an enormous amount of work,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
and you need an enormous amount of encouragement.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
One of those dark spots is Madagascar,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
a country which is generally better known for the Dreamworks film

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
than it is actually known for

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
the lovely people who live there.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
And so the people who founded

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Foko Club in Madagascar

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
weren't actually concerned with trying to change the image of their country.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
They were doing something much simpler.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
It was a club to learn English

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
and to learn computers and the internet.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
but what happened was that Madagascar

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
went through a violent coup.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Most independent media was shut down.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
And the high school students

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
who were learning to blog through Foko Club

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
suddenly found themselves talking to an international audience

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
about the demonstrations, the violence,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
everything that was going on within this country.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
So a very, very small program

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
designed to get people in front of computers,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
publishing their own thoughts, publishing independent media,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
ended up having a huge impact

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
on what we know about this country.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Now the trick with this is that I'm guessing

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
most people here don't speak Malagasy.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
I'm also guessing that most of you don't even speak Chinese --

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
which is sort of sad if you think about it,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
as it's now the most represented language on the internet.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Fortunately people are trying to figure out how to fix this.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
If you're using Google Chrome and you go to a Chinese language site,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
you notice this really cute box at the top,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
which automatically detects that the page is in Chinese

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
and very quickly at a mouse click

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
will give you a translation of the page.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Unfortunately, it's a machine translation of the page.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
And while Google is very, very good with some languages,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
it's actually pretty dreadful with Chinese.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
And the results can be pretty funny.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
What you really want -- what I really want,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
is eventually the ability to push a button

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
and have this queued

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
so a human being can translate this.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And if you think this is absurd, it's not.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
There's a group right now in China called Yeeyan.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
And Yeeyan is a group

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
of 150,000 volunteers

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
who get online every day.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
They look for the most interesting content in the English language.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
They translate roughly 100 articles a day

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
from major newspapers, major websites.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
They put it online for free.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
It's the project of a guy named Zhang Lei,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
who was living in the United States during the Lhasa riots

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
and who couldn't believe how biased

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
American media coverage was.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
And he said, "If there's one thing I can do, I can start translating,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
so that people between these countries

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
start understanding each other a little bit better."

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
And my question to you is:

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
if Yeeyan can line up 150,000 people

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
to translate the English internet into Chinese,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
where's the English language Yeeyan?

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Who's going after Chinese,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
which now has 400 million internet users out there?

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
My guess is at least one of them has something interesting to say.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
So even if we can find a way to translate from Chinese,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
there's no guarantee that we're going to find it.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
When we look for information online,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
we basically have two strategies.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
We use a lot of search.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
And search is terrific if you know what you're looking for.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
But if what you're looking for is serendipity,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
if you want to stumble onto something

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
that you didn't know you needed,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
our main philosophy is to look to our social networks,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
to look for our friends.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
What are they looking at? Maybe we should be looking at it.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
The problem with this is that essentially

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
what you end up getting after a while is the wisdom of the flock.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
You end up flocking with a lot of people

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
who are probably similar to you,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
who have similar interests.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
And it's very, very hard to get information

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
from the other flocks, from the other parts of the world

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
where people getting together and talking about their own interests.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
To do this, at a certain point,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
you need someone to bump you out of your flock and into another flock.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
You need a guide.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
So this is Amira Al Hussaini. She is the Middle East editor for Global Voices.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
She has one of the hardest jobs in the world.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Not only does she have to keep our Israeli and Palestinian contributors

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
from killing each other,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
she has to figure out

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
what is going to interest you

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
about the Middle East.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
And in that sense of trying to get you

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
out of your normal orbit,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
and to try to get you to pay attention

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
to a story about someone who's

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
given up smoking for the month of Ramadan,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
she has to know something about a global audience.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
She has to know something about what stories are available.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Basically, she's a deejay.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
She's a skilled human curator

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
who knows what material is available to her,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
who's able to listen to the audience,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
and who's able to make a selection

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
and push people forward in one fashion or another.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
I don't think this is necessarily an algorithmic process.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
I think what's great about the internet

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
is that it actually makes it much easier

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
for deejays to reach a wider audience.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
I know Amira.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
I can ask her what to read.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
But with the internet, she's in a position where she can

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
tell a lot of people what to read.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
And you can listen to her as well,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
if this is a way that you're interested in having your web widened.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
So once you start widening like this,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
once you start lighting up voices in the dark spots,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
once you start translating, once you start curating,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
you end up in some really weird places.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
This is an image from pretty much my favorite blog,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
which is AfriGadget.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
And AfriGadget is a blog that looks

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
at technology in an Africa context.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
And specifically, it's looking at a blacksmith

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
in Kibera in Nairobi,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
who is turning the shaft of a Landrover

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
into a cold chisel.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
And when you look at this image, you might find yourself going,

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
"Why would I conceivably care about this?"

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
And the truth is, this guy can probably explain this to you.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
This is Erik Hersman. You guys may have seen him around the conference.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
He goes by the moniker White African.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
He's both a very well known American geek,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
but he's also Kenyan; he was born in Sudan, grew up in Kenya.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
He is a bridge figure.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
He is someone who literally has feet in both worlds --

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
one in the world of the African technology community,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
one in the world of the American technology community.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
And so he's able to tell a story

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
about this blacksmith in Kibera

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
and turn it into a story about repurposing technology,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
about innovating from constraint,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
about looking for inspiration based on reusing materials.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
He knows one world,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
and he's finding a way to communicate it to another world,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
both of which he has deep connections to.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
These bridge figures, I'm pretty well convinced,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
are the future of how we try to make the world wider

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
through using the web.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
But the trick with bridges is, ultimately,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
you need someone to cross them.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
And that's where we start talking about xenophiles.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
So if I found myself in the NFL,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
I suspect I would spend my off-season

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
nursing my wounds, enjoying my house, so on and so forth --

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
possibly recording a hip-hop album.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Dhani Jones,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
who is the middle linebacker for the Cincinnati Bengals,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
has a slightly different approach to the off-season.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Dhani has a television show.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
It's called "Dhani Tackles the Globe."

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
And every week on this television show,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
Dhani travels to a different nation of the world.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
He finds a local sporting team.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
He trains with them for a week, and he plays a match with them.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
And his reason for this

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
is not just that he wants to master Muay Thai boxing.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
It's because, for him,

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
sport is the language

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
that allows him to encounter

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
the full width and wonder of the world.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
For some of us it might be music. For some of us it might be food.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
For a lot of us it might be literature or writing.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
But there are all these different techniques

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
that allow you to go out and look at the world

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
and find your place within it.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
The goal of my Talk here

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
is not to persuade the people in this room

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
to embrace your xenophilia.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
My guess -- given that you're at a conference called TEDGlobal --

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
is that most of you are xenophiles,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
whether or not you use that term.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
My challenge instead is this.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
It's not enough to make the personal decision

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
that you want a wider world.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
We have to figure out how to rewire

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
the systems that we have.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
We have to fix our media.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
We have to fix the internet. We have to fix our education.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
We have to fix our immigration policy.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
We need to look at ways

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
of creating serendipity,

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
of making translation pervasive,

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
and we need to find ways to embrace

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
and celebrate these bridge figures.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
And we need to figure out how to cultivate xenophiles.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
That's what I'm trying to do. I need your help.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
(Applause)
