00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm a storyteller.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
That's what I do in life -- telling stories,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
writing novels --

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and today I would like to tell you a few stories

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
about the art of storytelling

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and also some supernatural creatures

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
called the djinni.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
But before I go there, please allow me to share with you

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
glimpses of my personal story.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I will do so with the help of words, of course,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
but also a geometrical shape, the circle,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
so throughout my talk,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
you will come across several circles.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I was born in Strasbourg, France

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
to Turkish parents.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Shortly after, my parents got separated,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and I came to Turkey with my mom.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
From then on, I was raised

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
as a single child by a single mother.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Now in the early 1970s, in Ankara,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
that was a bit unusual.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Our neighborhood was full of large families,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
where fathers were the heads of households,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
so I grew up seeing my mother as a divorcee

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
in a patriarchal environment.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
In fact, I grew up observing

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
two different kinds of womanhood.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
On the one hand was my mother,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
a well-educated, secular, modern, westernized, Turkish woman.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
On the other hand was my grandmother,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
who also took care of me

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and was more spiritual, less educated

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and definitely less rational.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
This was a woman who read coffee grounds to see the future

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and melted lead into mysterious shapes

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
to fend off the evil eye.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Many people visited my grandmother,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
people with severe acne on their faces

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
or warts on their hands.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Each time, my grandmother would utter some words in Arabic,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
take a red apple and stab it

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
with as many rose thorns

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
as the number of warts she wanted to remove.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Then one by one, she would

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
encircle these thorns with dark ink.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
A week later, the patient would come back

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
for a follow-up examination.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Now, I'm aware that I should not be saying such things

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
in front of an audience of scholars and scientists,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
but the truth is, of all the people

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
who visited my grandmother for their skin conditions,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I did not see anyone go back

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
unhappy or unhealed.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I asked her how she did this. Was it the power of praying?

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
In response she said, "Yes, praying is effective,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
but also beware of the power of circles."

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
From her, I learned, amongst many other things,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
one very precious lesson --

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
that if you want to destroy something in this life,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
be it an acne, a blemish

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
or the human soul,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
all you need to do is to surround it with thick walls.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
It will dry up inside.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Now we all live in some kind of a social and cultural circle.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
We all do.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
We're born into a certain family, nation, class.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
But if we have no connection whatsoever

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
with the worlds beyond the one we take for granted,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
then we too run the risk

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
of drying up inside.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Our imagination might shrink;

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
our hearts might dwindle,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and our humanness might wither

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
if we stay for too long

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
inside our cultural cocoons.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Our friends, neighbors, colleagues, family --

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
if all the people in our inner circle resemble us,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
it means we are surrounded

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
with our mirror image.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Now one other thing women like my grandma do in Turkey

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
is to cover mirrors with velvet

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
or to hang them on the walls with their backs facing out.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
It's an old Eastern tradition

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
based on the knowledge that it's not healthy

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
for a human being to spend too much time

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
staring at his own reflection.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Ironically, [living in] communities of the like-minded

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
is one of the greatest dangers

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
of today's globalized world.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And it's happening everywhere,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
among liberals and conservatives,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
agnostics and believers, the rich and the poor,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
East and West alike.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
We tend to form clusters

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
based on similarity,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
and then we produce stereotypes

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
about other clusters of people.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
In my opinion, one way of transcending

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
these cultural ghettos

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
is through the art of storytelling.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Stories cannot demolish frontiers,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
but they can punch holes in our mental walls.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
And through those holes, we can get a glimpse of the other,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
and sometimes even like what we see.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
I started writing fiction at the age of eight.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
My mother came home one day with a turquoise notebook

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
and asked me if I'd be interested in keeping a personal journal.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
In retrospect, I think she was slightly worried

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
about my sanity.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
I was constantly telling stories at home, which was good,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
except I told this to imaginary friends around me,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
which was not so good.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
I was an introverted child,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
to the point of communicating with colored crayons

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
and apologizing to objects

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
when I bumped into them,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
so my mother thought it might do me good

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
to write down my day-to-day experiences

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
and emotions.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
What she didn't know was that I thought my life was terribly boring,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
and the last thing I wanted to do

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
was to write about myself.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
Instead, I began to write about people other than me

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
and things that never really happened.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
And thus began my life-long passion

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
for writing fiction.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
So from the very beginning, fiction for me

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
was less of an autobiographical manifestation

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
than a transcendental journey

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
into other lives, other possibilities.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
And please bear with me:

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
I'll draw a circle and come back to this point.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Now one other thing happened around this same time.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
My mother became a diplomat.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
So from this small, superstitious,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
middle-class neighborhood of my grandmother,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
I was zoomed into this

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
posh, international school [in Madrid],

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
where I was the only Turk.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
It was here that I had my first encounter

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
with what I call the "representative foreigner."

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
In our classroom, there were children from all nationalities,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
yet this diversity did not necessarily lead

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
to a cosmopolitan, egalitarian

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
classroom democracy.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Instead, it generated an atmosphere

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
in which each child was seen --

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
not as an individual on his own,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
but as the representative of something larger.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
We were like a miniature United Nations, which was fun,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
except whenever something negative,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
with regards to a nation

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
or a religion, took place.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
The child who represented it was mocked,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
ridiculed and bullied endlessly.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
And I should know, because during the time I attended that school,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
a military takeover happened in my country,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
a gunman of my nationality nearly killed the Pope,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
and Turkey got zero points in [the] Eurovision Song Contest.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
(Laughter)

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
I skipped school often and dreamed of becoming a sailor

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
during those days.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
I also had my first taste

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
of cultural stereotypes there.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
The other children asked me about the movie

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
"Midnight Express," which I had not seen;

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
they inquired how many cigarettes a day I smoked,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
because they thought all Turks were heavy smokers,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
and they wondered at what age

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
I would start covering my hair.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
I came to learn that these were

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
the three main stereotypes about my country:

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
politics, cigarettes

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
and the veil.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
After Spain, we went to Jordan, Germany

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
and Ankara again.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Everywhere I went, I felt like

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
my imagination was the only suitcase

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
I could take with me.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Stories gave me a sense of center,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
continuity and coherence,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
the three big Cs that I otherwise lacked.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
In my mid-twenties, I moved to Istanbul,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
the city I adore.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
I lived in a very vibrant, diverse neighborhood

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
where I wrote several of my novels.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
I was in Istanbul when the earthquake hit

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
in 1999.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
When I ran out of the building at three in the morning,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
I saw something that stopped me in my tracks.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
There was the local grocer there --

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
a grumpy, old man who didn't sell alcohol

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
and didn't speak to marginals.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
He was sitting next to a transvestite

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
with a long black wig

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
and mascara running down her cheeks.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
I watched the man open a pack of cigarettes

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
with trembling hands

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
and offer one to her,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
and that is the image of the night of the earthquake

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
in my mind today --

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
a conservative grocer and a crying transvestite

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
smoking together on the sidewalk.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
In the face of death and destruction,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
our mundane differences evaporated,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
and we all became one

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
even if for a few hours.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
But I've always believed that stories, too, have a similar effect on us.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
I'm not saying that fiction has the magnitude of an earthquake,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
but when we are reading a good novel,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
we leave our small, cozy apartments behind,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
go out into the night alone

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
and start getting to know people we had never met before

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
and perhaps had even been biased against.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Shortly after, I went

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
to a women's college in Boston, then Michigan.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
I experienced this, not so much as a geographical shift,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
as a linguistic one.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
I started writing fiction in English.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
I'm not an immigrant, refugee or exile --

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
they ask me why I do this --

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
but the commute between languages

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
gives me the chance to recreate myself.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
I love writing in Turkish,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
which to me is very poetic and very emotional,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
and I love writing in English, which to me

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
is very mathematical and cerebral.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
So I feel connected to each language in a different way.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
For me, like millions of other people

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
around the world today,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
English is an acquired language.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
When you're a latecomer to a language,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
what happens is you live there

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
with a continuous

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
and perpetual frustration.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
As latecomers, we always want to say more, you know,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
crack better jokes, say better things,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
but we end up saying less

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
because there's a gap between the mind and the tongue.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And that gap is very intimidating.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
But if we manage not to be frightened by it,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
it's also stimulating.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
And this is what I discovered in Boston --

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
that frustration was very stimulating.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000
At this stage, my grandmother,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
who had been watching the course of my life

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
with increasing anxiety,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
started to include in her daily prayers

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
that I urgently get married

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
so that I could settle down once and for all.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
And because God loves her, I did get married.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
(Laughter)

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
But instead of settling down,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
I went to Arizona.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
And since my husband is in Istanbul,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
I started commuting between Arizona and Istanbul --

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
the two places on the surface of earth

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
that couldn't be more different.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
I guess one part of me has always been a nomad,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
physically and spiritually.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Stories accompany me,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
keeping my pieces and memories together,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
like an existential glue.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Yet as much as I love stories,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
recently, I've also begun to think

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
that they lose their magic

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
if and when a story is seen as more than a story.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
And this is a subject that I would love

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
to think about together.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
When my first novel written in English came out in America,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
I heard an interesting remark from a literary critic.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
"I liked your book," he said, "but I wish you had written it differently."

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
(Laughter)

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
I asked him what he meant by that.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
He said, "Well, look at it. There's so many

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Spanish, American, Hispanic characters in it,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
but there's only one Turkish character and it's a man."

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Now the novel took place on a university campus in Boston,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
so to me, it was normal

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
that there be more international characters in it

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
than Turkish characters,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
but I understood what my critic was looking for.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
And I also understood that I

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
would keep disappointing him.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
He wanted to see the manifestation of my identity.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
He was looking for a Turkish woman in the book

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
because I happened to be one.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
We often talk about how stories change the world,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
but we should also see how the world of identity politics

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
affects the way stories

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
are being circulated,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
read and reviewed.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Many authors feel this pressure,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
but non-Western authors feel it more heavily.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
If you're a woman writer from the Muslim world, like me,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
then you are expected to write

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
the stories of Muslim women

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
and, preferably, the unhappy stories

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
of unhappy Muslim women.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
You're expected to write

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
informative, poignant and characteristic stories

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
and leave the experimental and avant-garde

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
to your Western colleagues.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
What I experienced as a child in that school in Madrid

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
is happening in the literary world today.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Writers are not seen

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
as creative individuals on their own,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
but as the representatives

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
of their respective cultures:

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
a few authors from China, a few from Turkey,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
a few from Nigeria.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
We're all thought to have something very distinctive,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
if not peculiar.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
The writer and commuter James Baldwin

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
gave an interview in 1984

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
in which he was repeatedly asked about his homosexuality.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
When the interviewer tried to pigeonhole him

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
as a gay writer,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Baldwin stopped and said,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
"But don't you see? There's nothing in me

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
that is not in everybody else,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
and nothing in everybody else

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
that is not in me."

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
When identity politics tries to put labels on us,

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
it is our freedom of imagination that is in danger.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
There's a fuzzy category called

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
multicultural literature

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
in which all authors from outside the Western world

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
are lumped together.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
I never forget my first multicultural reading,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
in Harvard Square about 10 years ago.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
We were three writers, one from the Philippines,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
one Turkish and one Indonesian --

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
like a joke, you know.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
(Laughter)

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
And the reason why we were brought together

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
was not because we shared an artistic style

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
or a literary taste.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
It was only because of our passports.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Multicultural writers are expected to tell real stories,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
not so much the imaginary.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
A function is attributed to fiction.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
In this way, not only the writers themselves,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
but also their fictional characters

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
become the representatives of something larger.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
But I must quickly add

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
that this tendency to see a story

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
as more than a story

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
does not solely come from the West.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
It comes from everywhere.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
And I experienced this firsthand

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
when I was put on trial in 2005

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
for the words my fictional characters uttered in a novel.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
I had intended to write

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
a constructive, multi-layered novel

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
about an Armenian and a Turkish family

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
through the eyes of women.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
My micro story became a macro issue

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
when I was prosecuted.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Some people criticized, others praised me

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
for writing about the Turkish-Armenian conflict.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
But there were times when I wanted to remind both sides

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
that this was fiction.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
It was just a story.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
And when I say, "just a story,"

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
I'm not trying to belittle my work.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
I want to love and celebrate fiction

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
for what it is,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
not as a means to an end.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Writers are entitled to their political opinions,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
and there are good political novels out there,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
but the language of fiction

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
is not the language of daily politics.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Chekhov said,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
"The solution to a problem

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
and the correct way of posing the question

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
are two completely separate things.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
And only the latter is an artist's responsibility."

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Identity politics divides us. Fiction connects.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
One is interested in sweeping generalizations.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
The other, in nuances.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
One draws boundaries.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
The other recognizes no frontiers.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Identity politics is made of solid bricks.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
Fiction is flowing water.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
In the Ottoman times, there were itinerant storytellers called "meddah."

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
They would go to coffee houses,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
where they would tell a story in front of an audience,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
often improvising.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
With each new person in the story,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
the meddah would change his voice,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
impersonating that character.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Everybody could go and listen, you know --

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
ordinary people, even the sultan, Muslims and non-Muslims.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Stories cut across all boundaries,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
like "The Tales of Nasreddin Hodja,"

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
which were very popular throughout the Middle East,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
North Africa, the Balkans and Asia.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Today, stories continue

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
to transcend borders.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
When Palestinian and Israeli politicians talk,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
they usually don't listen to each other,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
but a Palestinian reader

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
still reads a novel by a Jewish author,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
and vice versa, connecting and empathizing

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
with the narrator.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Literature has to take us beyond.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
If it cannot take us there,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
it is not good literature.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Books have saved the introverted,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
timid child that I was -- that I once was.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
But I'm also aware of the danger

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
of fetishizing them.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
When the poet and mystic, Rumi,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
met his spiritual companion, Shams of Tabriz,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
one of the first things the latter did

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
was to toss Rumi's books into water

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
and watch the letters dissolve.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
The Sufis say, "Knowledge that takes you not beyond yourself

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
is far worse than ignorance."

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
The problem with today's cultural ghettos

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
is not lack of knowledge --

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
we know a lot about each other, or so we think --

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
but knowledge that takes us not beyond ourselves:

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
it makes us elitist,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
distant and disconnected.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
There's a metaphor which I love:

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
living like a drawing compass.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
As you know, one leg of the compass is static, rooted in a place.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Meanwhile, the other leg

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
draws a wide circle, constantly moving.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Like that, my fiction as well.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
One part of it is rooted in Istanbul,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
with strong Turkish roots,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
but the other part travels the world,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
connecting to different cultures.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
In that sense, I like to think of my fiction

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
as both local and universal,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
both from here and everywhere.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Now those of you who have been to Istanbul

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
have probably seen Topkapi Palace,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
which was the residence of Ottoman sultans

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
for more than 400 years.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
In the palace, just outside the quarters

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
of the favorite concubines,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
there's an area called The Gathering Place of the Djinn.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
It's between buildings.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
I'm intrigued by this concept.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
We usually distrust those areas

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
that fall in between things.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
We see them as the domain

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
of supernatural creatures like the djinn,

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
who are made of smokeless fire

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
and are the symbol of elusiveness.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
But my point is perhaps

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
that elusive space

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
is what writers and artists need most.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
When I write fiction

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
I cherish elusiveness and changeability.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
I like not knowing what will happen 10 pages later.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
I like it when my characters surprise me.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
I might write about

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
a Muslim woman in one novel,

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
and perhaps it will be a very happy story,

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
and in my next book, I might write

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
about a handsome, gay professor in Norway.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
As long as it comes from our hearts,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
we can write about anything and everything.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Audre Lorde once said,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
"The white fathers taught us to say,

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
'I think, therefore I am.'"

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
She suggested, "I feel, therefore I am free."

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
I think it was a wonderful paradigm shift.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
And yet, why is it that,

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
in creative writing courses today,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
the very first thing we teach students is

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
"write what you know"?

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Perhaps that's not the right way to start at all.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Imaginative literature is not necessarily about

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
writing who we are or what we know

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
or what our identity is about.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
We should teach young people and ourselves

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
to expand our hearts

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
and write what we can feel.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
We should get out of our cultural ghetto

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
and go visit the next one and the next.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
In the end, stories move like whirling dervishes,

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000
drawing circles beyond circles.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
They connect all humanity,

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
regardless of identity politics,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
and that is the good news.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
And I would like to finish with an old Sufi poem:

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
"Come, let us be friends for once;

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
let us make life easy on us;

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
let us be lovers and loved ones;

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
the earth shall be left to no one."

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
Thank you.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:23.000
(Applause)
