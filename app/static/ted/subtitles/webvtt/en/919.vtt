00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In October 2010,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
the Justice League of America will be teaming up with The 99.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Icons like Batman,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Superman, Wonder Woman and their colleagues

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
will be teaming up with icons Jabbar, Noora,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Jami and their colleagues.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
It's a story of intercultural intersections,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and what better group

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
to have this conversation

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
than those that grew out of fighting fascism

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
in their respective histories and geographies?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
As fascism took over Europe in the 1930s,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
an unlikely reaction came out of North America.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
As Christian iconography got changed,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and swastikas were created out of crucifixes,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Batman and Superman were created by Jewish young men

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
in the United States and Canada,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
also going back to the Bible.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Consider this:

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
like the prophets, all the superheroes

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
are missing parents.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Superman's parents die on Krypton

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
before the age of one.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Bruce Wayne, who becomes Batman,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
loses his parents at the age of six in Gotham City.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Spiderman is raised

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
by his aunt and uncle.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And all of them, just like the prophets who get their message

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
from God through Gabriel,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
get their message from above.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Peter Parker is in a library in Manhattan

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
when the spider descends from above

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and gives him his message through a bite.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Bruce Wayne is in his bedroom

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
when a big bat flies over his head,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and he sees it as an omen to become Batman.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Superman is not only sent to Earth

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
from the heavens, or Krypton,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
but he's sent in a pod, much like Moses was on the Nile.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
(Laughter)

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And you hear the voice of his father, Jor-El,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
saying to Earth, "I have sent to you my only son."

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
(Laughter)

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
(Applause)

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
These are clearly biblical archetypes,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and the thinking behind that was to create

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
positive, globally-resonating storylines

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
that could be tied to the same things

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
that other people were pulling mean messages out of

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
because then the person that's using religion for the wrong purpose

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
just becomes a bad man with a bad message.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And it's only by linking positive things

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
that the negative can be delinked.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
This is the kind of thinking that went into

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
creating The 99.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
The 99 references the 99 attributes of Allah in the Koran,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
things like generosity and mercy and foresight and wisdom

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and dozens of others that no two people in the world would disagree about.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
It doesn't matter what your religion is;

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
even if you're an atheist, you don't raise your kid telling him, you know,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
"Make sure you lie three times a day."

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Those are basic human values.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And so the backstory of The 99

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
takes place in 1258,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
which history tells us the Mongols invaded Baghdad and destroyed it.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
All the books from Bait al-Hikma library,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
the most famous library in its day, were thrown in the Tigris River,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and the Tigris changes color with ink.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
It's a story passed on generation after generation.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
I rewrote that story,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and in my version, the librarians find out that this is going to happen --

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
and here's a side note:

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
if you want a comic book to do well, make the librarians the hero. It always works well.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
(Laughter)

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
(Applause)

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
So the librarians find out

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
and they get together a special solution, a chemical solution called King's Water,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
that when mixed with 99 stones

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
would be able to save all that culture and history in the books.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
But the Mongols get there first.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
The books and the solution get thrown in the Tigris River.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Some librarians escape, and over the course of days and weeks,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
they dip the stones into the Tigris and suck up that collective wisdom

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
that we all think is lost to civilization.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Those stones have been smuggled as three prayer beads

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
of 33 stones each

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
through Arabia into Andalusia in Spain, where they're safe for 200 years.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
But in 1492, two important things happen.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
The first is the fall of Granada,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
the last Muslim enclave in Europe.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
The second is Columbus finally gets funded to go to India, but he gets lost.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
(Laughter)

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
So 33 of the stones are smuggled

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
onto the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
and are spread in the New World.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Thirty-three go on the Silk Road to China, South Asia and Southeast Asia.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And 33 are spread between Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
And now it's 2010, and there are 99 heroes

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
from 99 different countries.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Now it's very easy to assume

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
that those books, because they were from a library called Bait al-Hikma, were Muslim books,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
but that's not the case because the caliph that built that library,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
his name was al-Ma'mun -- he was Harun al-Rashid's son.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
He had told his advisers, "Get me all the scholars

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
to translate any book they can get their hands onto into Arabic,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
and I will pay them its weight in gold."

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
After a while, his advisers complained.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
They said, "Your Highness, the scholars are cheating.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
They're writing in big handwriting to take more gold."

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
To which he said, "Let them be, because what they're giving us

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
is worth a lot more than what we're paying them."

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
So the idea of an open architecture, an open knowledge,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
is not new to my neck of the desert.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
The concept centers on something called the Noor stones.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Noor is Arabic for light.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
So these 99 stones, a few kind of rules in the game:

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Number one, you don't choose the stone; the stone chooses you.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
There's a King Arthur element to the storyline, okay.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Number two, all of The 99,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
when they first get their stone, or their power, abuse it;

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
they use it for self-interest.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And there's a very strong message in there that when you start abusing your stone,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
you get taken advantage of

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
by people who will exploit your powers, okay.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Number three, the 99 stones all have within them

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
a mechanism that self-updates.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Now there are two groups that exist within the Muslim world.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Everybody believes the Koran is for all time and all place.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Some believe that means that the original interpretation

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
from a couple thousand years ago is what's relevant today.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
I don't belong there.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
Then there's a group that believes the Koran is a living, breathing document,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
and I captured that idea within these stones that self-update.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Now the main bad guy, Rughal,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
does not want these stones to update,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
so he's trying to get them to stop updating.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
He can't use the stones, but he can stop them.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
And by stopping them, he has more of a fascist agenda,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
where he gets some of The 99 to work for him --

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
they're all wearing cookie-cutter, same color uniforms

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
They're not allowed to individually express who they are and what they are.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
And he controls them from the top down --

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
whereas when they work for the other side, eventually,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
when they find out this is the wrong person, they've been manipulated,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
they actually, each one has a different, colorful

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
kind of dress.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And the last point about the 99 Noor stones is this.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
So The 99 work in teams of three.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Why three? A couple of reasons.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Number one, we have a thing within Islam that you don't leave a boy and a girl alone together,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
because the third person is temptation or the devil, right?

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
I think that's there in all cultures, right?

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
But this is not about religion, it's not about proselytizing.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
There's this very strong social message

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
that needs to get to kind of

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
the deepest crevices of intolerance,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
and the only way to get there is to kind of play the game.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
And so this is the way I dealt with it.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
They work in teams of three: two boys and a girl, two girls and a boy,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
three boys, three girls, no problem.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And the Swiss psychoanalyst, Carl Jung, also spoke about

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
the importance of the number three in all cultures, so I figure I'm covered.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Well ...

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
I got accused in a few blogs that I was actually sent by the Pope

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
to preach the Trinity and Catholicism in the Middle East,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
so you -- (Laughter)

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
you believe who you want. I gave you my version of the story.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
So here's some of the characters that we have.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Mujiba, from Malaysia: her main power is she's able to answer any question.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
She's the Trivial Pursuit queen, if you want,

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
but when she first gets her power,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
she starts going on game shows and making money.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
We have Jabbar from Saudi who starts breaking things when he has the power.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Now, Mumita was a fun one to name. Mumita is the destroyer.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
So the 99 attributes of Allah have the yin and the yang;

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
there's the powerful, the hegemonous, the strong,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
and there's also the kind, the generous.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
I'm like, are all the girls going to be kind and merciful and the guys all strong?

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
I'm like, you know what, I've met a few girls who were destroyers in my lifetime, so ...

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
(Laughter)

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
We have Jami from Hungary, who first starts making weapons:

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
He's the technology wiz.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Musawwira from Ghana,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Hadya from Pakistan, Jaleel from Iran who uses fire.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
And this is one of my favorites, Al-Batina from Yemen.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Al-Batina is the hidden.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
So Al-Batina is hidden, but she's a superhero.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
I came home to my wife and I said, "I created a character after you."

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
My wife is a Saudi from Yemeni roots.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
And she said, "Show me." So I showed this.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
She said, "That's not me."

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
I said, "Look at the eyes. They're your eyes."

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
(Laughter)

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
So I promised my investors this would not be another made-in-fifth-world-country production.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
This was going to be Superman, or it wasn't worth my time or their money.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
So from day one, the people involved in the project,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
bottom left is Fabian Nicieza,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
writer for X-Men and Power Rangers.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Next to him is Dan Panosian,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
one of the character creators for the modern-day X-Men.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Top right is Stuart Moore, a writer for Iron Man.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Next to him is John McCrea, who was an inker for Spiderman.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And we entered Western consciousness

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
with a tagline: "Next Ramadan, the world will have new heroes,"

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
back in 2005.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Now I went to Dubai, to an Arab Thought Foundation Conference,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
and I was waiting by the coffee for the right journalist.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Didn't have a product, but had energy.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
And I found somebody from The New York Times,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
and I cornered him, and I pitched him.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
And I think I scared him -- (Laughter)

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
because he basically promised me --

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
we had no product -- but he said, "We'll give you a paragraph in the arts section

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
if you'll just go away."

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
(Laughter)

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
So I said, "Great." So I called him up a few weeks afterward.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
I said, "Hi, Hesa." And he said, "Hi." I said, "Happy New Year."

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
He said, "Thank you. We had a baby." I said, "Congratulations."

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
Like I care, right?

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
"So when's the article coming out?"

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
He said, "Naif, Islam and cartoon?

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
That's not timely.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
You know, maybe next week, next month, next year, but, you know, it'll come out."

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
So a few days after that, what happens?

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
What happens is the world erupts in the Danish cartoon controversy.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
I became timely.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
(Laughter)

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
So flurry of phone calls and emails from The New York Times.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Next thing you knew, there's a full page covering us positively,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
January 22nd, 2006,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
which changed our lives forever,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
because anybody Googling Islam and cartoon or Islam and comic,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
guess what they got; they got me.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
And The 99 were like superheroes

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
kind of flying out of what was happening around the world.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
And that led to all kinds of things,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
from being in curricula in universities and schools to --

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
one of my favorite pictures I have from South Asia,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
it was a couple of men with long beards

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
and a lot of girls wearing the hijab -- it looked like a school.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
The good news is they're all holding copies of The 99, smiling,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
and they found me to sign the picture.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
The bad news is they were all photocopies, so we didn't make a dime in revenue.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
(Laughter)

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
We've been able to license The 99 comic books

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
into eight languages so far --

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Chinese, Indonesian, Hindi, Urdu, Turkish.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Opened a theme park through a license in Kuwait a year and a half ago

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
called The 99 Village Theme Park --

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
300,000 square feet, 20 rides, all with our characters:

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
a couple back-to-school licenses in Spain and Turkey.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
But the biggest thing we've done to date, which is just amazing,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
is that we've done a 26-episode animated series,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
which is done for global audiences:

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
in fact, we're already going to be in the U.S. and Turkey, we know.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
It's 3D CGI, which is going to be very high-quality,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
written in Hollywood by the writers behind Ben 10

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
and Spiderman and Star Wars: Clone Wars.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
In this clip I'm about to show you, which has never been seen in the public before,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
there is a struggle.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Two of the characters, Jabbar, the one with the muscles,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
and Noora, the one that can use light,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
are actually wearing the cookie-cutter fascist gray uniform

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
because they're being manipulated.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
They don't know, OK,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
and they're trying to get another member of The 99 to join them.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
So there's a struggle within the team.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
So if we can get the lights ...

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
["The 99"]

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Jabbar: Dana, I can't see where to grab hold.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
I need more light.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
What's happening?

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Dana: There's too much darkness.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Rughal: There must be something we can do.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Man: I won't send any more commandos in

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
until I know it's safe.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Dr. Razem: It's time to go, Miklos.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Miklos: Must download file contents.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
I can't forget auntie.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Jabbar: Dana, I can't do this without you.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Dana: But I can't help.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Jabbar: You can,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
even if you don't believe in yourself right now.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
I believe in you.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
You are Noora the Light.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Dana: No.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
I don't deserve it. I don't deserve anything.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Jabbar: Then what about the rest of us?

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Don't we deserve to be saved? Don't I?

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Now, tell me which way to go.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Dana: That way.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Alarm: Threat imminent.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Jabbar: Aaaahhh!

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Miklos: Stay away from me.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Jabbar: We're here to help you.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Dr. Razem: Don't listen to them.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Dana: Miklos, that man is not your friend.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Miklos: No. He gave me access,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
and you want to reboot the [unclear]. No more [unclear].

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
["The 99"]

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Thank you.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:51.000
(Applause)

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
So "The 99" is technology; it's entertainment;

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
it's design.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
But that's only half the story.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
As the father of five sons,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
I worry about who they're going to be using as role models.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
I worry because all around me, even within my extended family,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
I see religion being manipulated.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
As a psychologist, I worry

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
for the world in general,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
but worry about the perception of how people see themselves

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
in my part of the world.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Now, I'm a clinical psychologist. I'm licensed in New York State.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
I trained at Bellevue Hospital Survivors of Political Torture Program,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
and I heard one too many stories of people growing up

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
to idolize their leadership,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
only to end up being tortured by their heroes.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
And torture's a terrible enough thing as it is, but when it's done by your hero,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
that just breaks you in so many ways.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
I left Bellevue, went to business school and started this.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Now, one of the things that I refer to

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
when I -- about the importance of this message --

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
is that I gave a lecture at the medical school at Kuwait University,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
where I lecture on the biological basis of behavior,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
and I gave the students two articles, one from The New York Times

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
and one from New York magazine.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
And I took away the name of the writer, the name of the [unclear] -- everything was gone except the facts.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
And the first one was about a group called The Party of God,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
who wanted to ban Valentine's Day. Red was made illegal.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Any boys and girls caught flirting

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
would get married off immediately, okay.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
The second one was about a woman complaining

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
because three minivans with six bearded men pulled up

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
and started interrogating her on the spot

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
for talking to a man who wasn't related to her.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
And I asked the students in Kuwait where they thought these incidents took place.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
The first one, they said Saudi Arabia. There was no debate.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
The second one, they were actually split

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
between Saudi and Afghanistan.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
What blew their mind was the first one took place in India,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
it was the party of a Hindu God.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
The second one took place in upstate New York.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
It was an Orthodox Jewish community.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
But what breaks my heart and what's alarming

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
is that in those two interviews,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
the people around, who were interviewed as well,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
refer to that behavior as Talibanization.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
In other words, good Hindus and good Jews don't act this way.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
This is Islam's influence on Hinduism and Judaism.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
But what do the students in Kuwait say? They said it's us --

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
and this is dangerous.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
It's dangerous when a group self-identifies itself

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
as extreme.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
This is one of my sons, Rayan,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
who's a Scooby Doo addict.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
You can tell by the glasses there.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
He actually called me a meddling kid the other day.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
(Laughter)

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
But I borrow a lesson that I learned from him.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Last summer when we were in our home in New York,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
he was out in the yard playing in his playhouse. And I was in my office working,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
and he came in, "Baba, I want you to come with me. I want my toy."

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
"Yes, Rayan, just go away." He left his Scooby Doo in his house.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
I said, "Go away. I'm working. I'm busy."

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
And what Rayan did then

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
is he sat there, he tapped his foot on the floor, at three and a half,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
and he looked at me and he said, "Baba,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
I want you to come with me to my office in my house.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
I have work to do."

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
(Laughter)

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
(Applause)

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Rayan reframed the situation

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
and brought himself down to my level.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
(Laughter)

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
And with The 99, that is what we aim to do.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
You know, I think that there's a big parallel

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
between bending the crucifix out of shape

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
and creating swastikas.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
And when I see pictures like this, of parents or uncles

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
who think it's cute to have a little child

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
holding a Koran and having a suicide bomber belt around them

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
to protest something,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
the hope is by linking enough positive things

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
to the Koran,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000
that one day we can move this child

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
from being proud in the way they're proud there,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
to that.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
And I think --

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
I think The 99

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
can and will achieve its mission.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
As an undergrad at Tufts University, we were giving away free falafel one day

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
and, you know, it was Middle East Day or something.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
And people came up and picked up

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
the culturally resonant image of the falafel,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
ate it and, you know, talked and left.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
And no two people could disagree about what the word free was

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
and what the word falafel was, behind us, "free falafel." You know.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
(Laughter)

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Or so we thought,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
until a woman came rushing across the campus

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
and dropped her bag on the floor, pointed up to the sign and said,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
"Who's falafel?"

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
(Laughter)

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
True story.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
(Laughter)

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
She was actually coming out of an Amnesty International meeting.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
(Laughter)

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Just today, D.C. Comics announced

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
the cover of our upcoming crossover.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
On that cover you see Batman, Superman

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
and a fully-clothed Wonder Woman

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
with our Saudi member of The 99,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
our Emirati member and our Libyan member.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
On April 26, 2010,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
President Barack Obama said that

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
of all the initiatives since his now famous Cairo speech --

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
in which he reached out to the Muslim world --

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
the most innovative was that The 99 reach back out

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
to the Justice League of America.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
We live in a world in which the most culturally innocuous symbols,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
like the falafel, can be misunderstood because of baggage,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
and where religion can be twisted

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
and purposefully made where it's not supposed to be by others.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
In a world like that,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
they'll always be a job for Superman and The 99.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
Thank you very much.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:59.000
(Applause)
