00:00:00.626 --> 00:00:04.981
About 10 years ago, I took on the task
to teach global development

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:07.151
to Swedish undergraduate students.

00:00:07.175 --> 00:00:10.056
That was after having spent
about 20 years,

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.957
together with African institutions,

00:00:11.981 --> 00:00:13.579
studying hunger in Africa.

00:00:13.603 --> 00:00:17.601
So I was sort of expected
to know a little about the world.

00:00:17.625 --> 00:00:20.976
And I started, in our medical university,
Karolinska Institute,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.530
an undergraduate course
called Global Health.

00:00:24.554 --> 00:00:27.376
But when you get that opportunity,
you get a little nervous.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.734
I thought, these students coming to us
actually have the highest grade

00:00:30.758 --> 00:00:32.781
you can get in the Swedish college system,

00:00:32.805 --> 00:00:36.170
so I thought, maybe they know everything
I'm going to teach them about.

00:00:36.194 --> 00:00:38.191
So I did a pretest when they came.

00:00:38.215 --> 00:00:41.708
And one of the questions
from which I learned a lot was this one:

00:00:41.732 --> 00:00:46.001
"Which country has the highest
child mortality of these five pairs?"

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.960
And I put them together
so that in each pair of countries,

00:00:49.984 --> 00:00:53.429
one has twice the child
mortality of the other.

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:57.698
And this means that
it's much bigger, the difference,

00:00:57.722 --> 00:00:59.524
than the uncertainty of the data.

00:00:59.548 --> 00:01:01.859
I won't put you at a test here,
but it's Turkey,

00:01:01.883 --> 00:01:06.210
which is highest there, Poland,
Russia, Pakistan and South Africa.

00:01:06.234 --> 00:01:08.656
And these were the results
of the Swedish students.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.850
I did it so I got the confidence interval,
which is pretty narrow.

00:01:11.874 --> 00:01:15.859
And I got happy, of course -- a 1.8
right answer out of five possible.

00:01:15.883 --> 00:01:19.094
That means there was a place
for a professor of international health

00:01:19.118 --> 00:01:20.284
and for my course.

00:01:20.308 --> 00:01:21.341
(Laughter)

00:01:21.365 --> 00:01:25.404
But one late night,
when I was compiling the report,

00:01:25.428 --> 00:01:27.994
I really realized my discovery.

00:01:28.018 --> 00:01:32.943
I have shown that Swedish top students
know, statistically,

00:01:32.967 --> 00:01:35.976
significantly less about the world
than the chimpanzees.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.976
(Laughter)

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.459
Because the chimpanzee
would score half right

00:01:41.483 --> 00:01:44.113
if I gave them two bananas
with Sri Lanka and Turkey.

00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:47.559
They would be right half of the cases.
But the students are not there.

00:01:47.583 --> 00:01:51.798
The problem for me was not ignorance;
it was preconceived ideas.

00:01:51.822 --> 00:01:54.559
I did also an unethical study

00:01:54.583 --> 00:01:57.110
of the professors
of the Karolinska Institute,

00:01:57.134 --> 00:01:59.675
which hands out
the Nobel Prize in Medicine,

00:01:59.699 --> 00:02:01.995
and they are on par
with the chimpanzee there.

00:02:02.019 --> 00:02:04.454
(Laughter)

00:02:04.478 --> 00:02:08.661
This is where I realized that
there was really a need to communicate,

00:02:08.685 --> 00:02:11.589
because the data
of what's happening in the world

00:02:11.613 --> 00:02:13.574
and the child health of every country

00:02:13.598 --> 00:02:14.935
is very well aware.

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.726
So we did this software,
which displays it like this.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.708
Every bubble here is a country.

00:02:19.732 --> 00:02:24.721
This country over here is China.

00:02:24.745 --> 00:02:25.908
This is India.

00:02:25.932 --> 00:02:28.179
The size of the bubble is the population,

00:02:28.203 --> 00:02:31.759
and on this axis here,
I put fertility rate.

00:02:31.783 --> 00:02:34.226
Because my students, what they said

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.809
when they looked upon the world,
and I asked them,

00:02:36.833 --> 00:02:39.556
"What do you really
think about the world?"

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.849
Well, I first discovered
that the textbook was Tintin, mainly.

00:02:42.873 --> 00:02:43.918
(Laughter)

00:02:43.942 --> 00:02:46.457
And they said, "The world
is still 'we' and 'them.'

00:02:46.481 --> 00:02:49.934
And 'we' is the Western world
and 'them' is the Third World."

00:02:50.381 --> 00:02:52.891
"And what do you mean
with 'Western world?'" I said.

00:02:52.915 --> 00:02:54.892
"Well, that's long life and small family.

00:02:54.916 --> 00:02:57.304
And 'Third World' is short life
and large family."

00:02:58.058 --> 00:03:00.443
So this is what I could display here.

00:03:00.467 --> 00:03:02.124
I put fertility rate here --

00:03:02.148 --> 00:03:05.286
number of children per woman:
one, two, three, four,

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.341
up to about eight children per woman.

00:03:07.365 --> 00:03:11.345
We have very good data
since 1962, 1960, about,

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:13.402
on the size of families in all countries.

00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:14.801
The error margin is narrow.

00:03:14.825 --> 00:03:16.833
Here, I put life expectancy at birth,

00:03:16.857 --> 00:03:20.324
from 30 years in some countries,
up to about 70 years.

00:03:20.348 --> 00:03:23.751
And in 1962, there was really
a group of countries here

00:03:23.775 --> 00:03:25.632
that were industrialized countries,

00:03:25.656 --> 00:03:28.750
and they had small families
and long lives.

00:03:28.774 --> 00:03:30.874
And these were the developing countries.

00:03:30.898 --> 00:03:33.939
They had large families
and they had relatively short lives.

00:03:33.963 --> 00:03:37.644
Now, what has happened since 1962?
We want to see the change.

00:03:37.668 --> 00:03:40.605
Are the students right?
It's still two types of countries?

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:44.365
Or have these developing countries
got smaller families and they live here?

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:46.687
Or have they got longer lives
and live up there?

00:03:46.711 --> 00:03:48.552
Let's see. We stopped the world then.

00:03:48.576 --> 00:03:51.062
This is all UN statistics
that have been available.

00:03:51.086 --> 00:03:52.587
Here we go. Can you see there?

00:03:52.611 --> 00:03:55.898
It's China there, moving against
better health there, improving there.

00:03:55.922 --> 00:03:59.567
All the green Latin American countries
are moving towards smaller families.

00:03:59.591 --> 00:04:02.013
Your yellow ones here
are the Arabic countries,

00:04:02.037 --> 00:04:05.938
and they get longer life,
but not larger families.

00:04:05.962 --> 00:04:08.584
The Africans are the green here.
They still remain here.

00:04:08.608 --> 00:04:11.249
This is India; Indonesia
is moving on pretty fast.

00:04:11.273 --> 00:04:15.379
In the '80s here, you have Bangladesh
still among the African countries.

00:04:15.403 --> 00:04:18.631
But now, Bangladesh -- it's a miracle
that happens in the '80s --

00:04:18.655 --> 00:04:21.068
the imams start to promote
family planning,

00:04:21.092 --> 00:04:22.839
and they move up into that corner.

00:04:22.863 --> 00:04:26.161
And in the '90s, we have
the terrible HIV epidemic

00:04:26.185 --> 00:04:29.694
that takes down the life expectancy
of the African countries.

00:04:29.718 --> 00:04:33.366
And the rest of them all
move up into the corner,

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.776
where we have long lives and small family,

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.914
and we have a completely new world.

00:04:37.938 --> 00:04:41.152
(Applause)

00:04:48.561 --> 00:04:49.658
(Applause ends)

00:04:50.567 --> 00:04:52.380
Let me make a comparison directly

00:04:52.404 --> 00:04:55.418
between the United States
of America and Vietnam.

00:04:55.442 --> 00:04:56.641
1964:

00:04:57.538 --> 00:05:00.149
America had small families and long life;

00:05:00.173 --> 00:05:03.522
Vietnam had large families
and short lives.

00:05:03.546 --> 00:05:04.829
And this is what happens.

00:05:04.853 --> 00:05:10.194
The data during the war indicate
that even with all the death,

00:05:10.218 --> 00:05:12.447
there was an improvement
of life expectancy.

00:05:12.471 --> 00:05:15.255
By the end of the year,
family planning started in Vietnam,

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:16.973
and they went for smaller families.

00:05:16.997 --> 00:05:19.566
And the United States up there
is getting longer life,

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:20.778
keeping family size.

00:05:20.802 --> 00:05:24.407
And in the '80s now,
they give up Communist planning

00:05:24.431 --> 00:05:25.938
and they go for market economy,

00:05:25.962 --> 00:05:27.972
and it moves faster even than social life.

00:05:27.996 --> 00:05:30.332
And today, we have in Vietnam

00:05:30.356 --> 00:05:35.158
the same life expectancy
and the same family size

00:05:35.182 --> 00:05:37.945
here in Vietnam, 2003,

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:42.036
as in United States, 1974,
by the end of the war.

00:05:42.513 --> 00:05:45.809
I think we all, if we don't
look at the data,

00:05:45.833 --> 00:05:49.054
we underestimate
the tremendous change in Asia,

00:05:49.078 --> 00:05:53.769
which was in social change
before we saw the economic change.

00:05:53.793 --> 00:05:56.160
So let's move over to another way here

00:05:56.184 --> 00:06:00.671
in which we could display
the distribution in the world

00:06:00.695 --> 00:06:01.975
of income.

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:05.695
This is the world distribution
of income of people.

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:10.345
One dollar, 10 dollars
or 100 dollars per day.

00:06:11.071 --> 00:06:14.483
There's no gap between rich
and poor any longer. This is a myth.

00:06:14.507 --> 00:06:16.522
There's a little hump here.

00:06:17.195 --> 00:06:18.835
But there are people all the way.

00:06:18.859 --> 00:06:23.245
And if we look where the income ends up,

00:06:23.269 --> 00:06:27.464
this is 100 percent
of the world's annual income.

00:06:27.488 --> 00:06:29.953
And the richest 20 percent,

00:06:29.977 --> 00:06:34.096
they take out of that about 74 percent.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:39.036
And the poorest 20 percent,
they take about two percent.

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.815
And this shows that the concept
of developing countries

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:43.406
is extremely doubtful.

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:45.311
We think about aid,

00:06:45.335 --> 00:06:48.948
like these people here giving aid
to these people here.

00:06:48.972 --> 00:06:52.092
But in the middle, we have
most of the world population,

00:06:52.116 --> 00:06:54.725
and they have now
24 percent of the income.

00:06:54.749 --> 00:06:56.405
We heard it in other forms.

00:06:56.429 --> 00:06:59.130
And who are these?

00:06:59.154 --> 00:07:01.374
Where are the different countries?

00:07:01.398 --> 00:07:02.944
I can show you Africa.

00:07:02.968 --> 00:07:04.559
This is Africa.

00:07:05.078 --> 00:07:06.841
Ten percent of the world population,

00:07:06.865 --> 00:07:08.031
most in poverty.

00:07:08.055 --> 00:07:12.430
This is OECD -- the rich countries,
the country club of the UN.

00:07:12.454 --> 00:07:17.870
And they are over here on this side.
Quite an overlap between Africa and OECD.

00:07:17.894 --> 00:07:19.242
And this is Latin America.

00:07:19.266 --> 00:07:22.621
It has everything on this earth,
from the poorest to the richest

00:07:22.645 --> 00:07:24.018
in Latin America.

00:07:24.042 --> 00:07:27.149
And on top of that,
we can put East Europe,

00:07:27.173 --> 00:07:30.348
we can put East Asia,
and we put South Asia.

00:07:30.372 --> 00:07:33.502
And what did it look like
if we go back in time,

00:07:33.526 --> 00:07:35.619
to about 1970?

00:07:35.643 --> 00:07:38.165
Then, there was more of a hump.

00:07:39.242 --> 00:07:43.001
And most who lived
in absolute poverty were Asians.

00:07:43.025 --> 00:07:45.972
The problem in the world
was the poverty in Asia.

00:07:45.996 --> 00:07:49.114
And if I now let the world move forward,

00:07:49.138 --> 00:07:51.750
you will see that
while population increases,

00:07:51.774 --> 00:07:55.087
there are hundreds of millions
in Asia getting out of poverty,

00:07:55.111 --> 00:07:57.076
and some others getting into poverty,

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.001
and this is the pattern we have today.

00:07:59.025 --> 00:08:01.096
And the best projection
from the World Bank

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.034
is that this will happen,

00:08:03.058 --> 00:08:04.906
and we will not have a divided world.

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:06.825
We'll have most people in the middle.

00:08:06.849 --> 00:08:08.876
Of course it's a logarithmic scale here,

00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:12.297
but our concept of economy
is growth with percent.

00:08:12.321 --> 00:08:17.606
We look upon it as a possibility
of percentile increase.

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:22.454
If I change this and take GDP per capita
instead of family income,

00:08:22.478 --> 00:08:26.249
and I turn these individual data

00:08:26.273 --> 00:08:29.549
into regional data
of gross domestic product,

00:08:29.573 --> 00:08:31.461
and I take the regions down here,

00:08:31.485 --> 00:08:33.724
the size of the bubble
is still the population.

00:08:33.748 --> 00:08:36.946
And you have the OECD there,
and you have sub-Saharan Africa there,

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:39.211
and we take off the Arab states there,

00:08:39.235 --> 00:08:41.453
coming both from Africa and from Asia,

00:08:41.477 --> 00:08:43.143
and we put them separately,

00:08:43.167 --> 00:08:48.264
and we can expand this axis,
and I can give it a new dimension here,

00:08:48.288 --> 00:08:51.637
by adding the social values
there, child survival.

00:08:51.661 --> 00:08:53.389
Now I have money on that axis,

00:08:53.413 --> 00:08:56.156
and I have the possibility
of children to survive there.

00:08:56.180 --> 00:09:00.437
In some countries, 99.7% of children
survive to five years of age;

00:09:00.461 --> 00:09:02.186
others, only 70.

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:05.478
And here, it seems,
there is a gap between OECD,

00:09:05.502 --> 00:09:08.756
Latin America, East Europe, East Asia,

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:12.665
Arab states, South Asia
and sub-Saharan Africa.

00:09:12.689 --> 00:09:17.597
The linearity is very strong
between child survival and money.

00:09:17.621 --> 00:09:20.917
But let me split sub-Saharan Africa.

00:09:20.941 --> 00:09:25.865
Health is there
and better health is up there.

00:09:25.889 --> 00:09:30.351
I can go here, and I can split
sub-Saharan Africa into its countries.

00:09:30.375 --> 00:09:31.577
And when it bursts,

00:09:31.601 --> 00:09:35.247
the size of each country bubble
is the size of the population.

00:09:35.271 --> 00:09:37.811
Sierra Leone down there,
Mauritius is up there.

00:09:37.835 --> 00:09:41.491
Mauritius was the first country
to get away with trade barriers,

00:09:41.515 --> 00:09:45.040
and they could sell their sugar,
they could sell their textiles,

00:09:45.064 --> 00:09:48.778
on equal terms as the people
in Europe and North America.

00:09:48.802 --> 00:09:50.934
There's a huge difference [within] Africa.

00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:52.826
And Ghana is here in the middle.

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:55.442
In Sierra Leone, humanitarian aid.

00:09:55.466 --> 00:09:58.776
Here in Uganda, development aid.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:02.095
Here, time to invest;
there, you can go for a holiday.

00:10:02.119 --> 00:10:04.861
There's tremendous variation
within Africa,

00:10:04.885 --> 00:10:07.976
which we very often make
that it's equal everything.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.239
I can split South Asia here.
India's the big bubble in the middle.

00:10:12.263 --> 00:10:16.703
But there's a huge difference
between Afghanistan and Sri Lanka.

00:10:16.727 --> 00:10:18.862
I can split Arab states. How are they?

00:10:18.886 --> 00:10:23.018
Same climate, same culture,
same religion -- huge difference.

00:10:23.042 --> 00:10:24.264
Even between neighbors --

00:10:24.288 --> 00:10:25.533
Yemen, civil war;

00:10:25.557 --> 00:10:29.723
United Arab Emirates, money,
which was quite equally and well-used.

00:10:29.747 --> 00:10:31.529
Not as the myth is.

00:10:31.553 --> 00:10:35.662
And that includes all the children
of the foreign workers

00:10:35.686 --> 00:10:37.260
who are in the country.

00:10:37.284 --> 00:10:40.976
Data is often better than you think.
Many people say data is bad.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.143
There is an uncertainty margin,
but we can see the difference here:

00:10:44.167 --> 00:10:45.529
Cambodia, Singapore.

00:10:45.553 --> 00:10:48.524
The differences are much bigger
than the weakness of the data.

00:10:48.548 --> 00:10:53.195
East Europe: Soviet economy
for a long time,

00:10:53.219 --> 00:10:56.431
but they come out after 10 years
very, very differently.

00:10:56.455 --> 00:10:59.188
And there is Latin America.

00:10:59.212 --> 00:11:00.858
Today, we don't have to go to Cuba

00:11:00.882 --> 00:11:02.910
to find a healthy country
in Latin America.

00:11:02.934 --> 00:11:07.568
Chile will have a lower child mortality
than Cuba within some few years from now.

00:11:07.592 --> 00:11:10.647
Here, we have high-income
countries in the OECD.

00:11:10.671 --> 00:11:14.463
And we get the whole pattern
here of the world,

00:11:14.487 --> 00:11:16.638
which is more or less like this.

00:11:16.662 --> 00:11:20.602
And if we look at it, how the world looks,

00:11:21.658 --> 00:11:24.976
in 1960, it starts to move.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.632
This is Mao Zedong.
He brought health to China.

00:11:27.656 --> 00:11:28.822
And then he died.

00:11:28.846 --> 00:11:31.458
And then Deng Xiaoping came
and brought money to China,

00:11:31.482 --> 00:11:33.536
and brought them
into the mainstream again.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:37.718
And we have seen how countries
move in different directions like this,

00:11:37.742 --> 00:11:43.647
so it's sort of difficult to get
an example country

00:11:43.671 --> 00:11:45.816
which shows the pattern of the world.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:52.694
But I would like to bring you back
to about here, at 1960.

00:11:53.083 --> 00:12:00.074
I would like to compare
South Korea, which is this one,

00:12:00.098 --> 00:12:03.456
with Brazil, which is this one.

00:12:04.154 --> 00:12:05.936
The label went away for me here.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.885
And I would like to compare
Uganda, which is there.

00:12:09.699 --> 00:12:12.882
I can run it forward, like this.

00:12:14.748 --> 00:12:21.744
And you can see how South Korea is making
a very, very fast advancement,

00:12:21.768 --> 00:12:24.353
whereas Brazil is much slower.

00:12:24.377 --> 00:12:30.521
And if we move back again, here,
and we put trails on them, like this,

00:12:30.545 --> 00:12:32.948
you can see again

00:12:32.972 --> 00:12:36.304
that the speed of development
is very, very different,

00:12:36.328 --> 00:12:42.088
and the countries are moving
more or less at the same rate

00:12:42.112 --> 00:12:43.539
as money and health,

00:12:43.563 --> 00:12:45.492
but it seems you can move much faster

00:12:45.516 --> 00:12:48.434
if you are healthy first
than if you are wealthy first.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.158
And to show that, you can put
on the way of United Arab Emirates.

00:12:53.182 --> 00:12:55.856
They came from here, a mineral country.

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:58.347
They cached all the oil;
they got all the money;

00:12:58.371 --> 00:13:00.807
but health cannot be bought
at the supermarket.

00:13:01.516 --> 00:13:04.663
You have to invest in health.
You have to get kids into schooling.

00:13:04.687 --> 00:13:07.877
You have to train health staff.
You have to educate the population.

00:13:07.901 --> 00:13:10.257
And Sheikh Zayed did that
in a fairly good way.

00:13:10.281 --> 00:13:14.244
In spite of falling oil prices,
he brought this country up here.

00:13:14.268 --> 00:13:17.976
So we've got a much more mainstream
appearance of the world,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.527
where all countries tend
to use their money

00:13:20.551 --> 00:13:22.846
better than they used it in the past.

00:13:24.269 --> 00:13:31.247
Now, this is, more or less, if you look
at the average data of the countries --

00:13:31.271 --> 00:13:32.465
they are like this.

00:13:32.489 --> 00:13:35.898
That's dangerous, to use average data,

00:13:35.922 --> 00:13:39.767
because there is such
a lot of difference within countries.

00:13:39.791 --> 00:13:42.285
So if I go and look here,

00:13:42.309 --> 00:13:48.854
we can see that Uganda today
is where South Korea was in 1960.

00:13:48.878 --> 00:13:52.666
If I split Uganda, there's quite
a difference within Uganda.

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:54.678
These are the quintiles of Uganda.

00:13:54.702 --> 00:13:56.882
The richest 20 percent
of Ugandans are there.

00:13:56.906 --> 00:13:58.377
The poorest are down there.

00:13:58.401 --> 00:14:01.232
If I split South Africa, it's like this.

00:14:01.256 --> 00:14:04.265
And if I go down and look at Niger,

00:14:04.289 --> 00:14:07.782
where there was such
a terrible famine [recently],

00:14:07.806 --> 00:14:08.957
it's like this.

00:14:08.981 --> 00:14:11.738
The 20 percent poorest
of Niger is out here,

00:14:11.762 --> 00:14:14.531
and the 20 percent richest
of South Africa is there,

00:14:14.555 --> 00:14:18.976
and yet we tend to discuss
what solutions there should be in Africa.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.567
Everything in this world exists in Africa.

00:14:21.591 --> 00:14:24.866
And you can't discuss
universal access to HIV [treatment]

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:26.809
for that quintile up here

00:14:26.833 --> 00:14:29.458
with the same strategy as down here.

00:14:29.482 --> 00:14:33.188
The improvement of the world
must be highly contextualized,

00:14:33.212 --> 00:14:36.865
and it's not relevant to have it
on a regional level.

00:14:36.889 --> 00:14:38.419
We must be much more detailed.

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:42.396
We find that students get very excited
when they can use this.

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:46.038
And even more, policy makers
and the corporate sectors

00:14:46.062 --> 00:14:49.723
would like to see
how the world is changing.

00:14:49.747 --> 00:14:51.622
Now, why doesn't this take place?

00:14:51.646 --> 00:14:53.949
Why are we not using the data we have?

00:14:53.973 --> 00:14:57.783
We have data in the United Nations,
in the national statistical agencies

00:14:57.807 --> 00:15:00.976
and in universities and other
nongovernmental organizations.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.737
Because the data is hidden
down in the databases.

00:15:03.761 --> 00:15:06.291
And the public is there,
and the internet is there,

00:15:06.315 --> 00:15:08.475
but we have still not used it effectively.

00:15:08.499 --> 00:15:11.174
All that information
we saw changing in the world

00:15:11.198 --> 00:15:14.139
does not include
publicly funded statistics.

00:15:14.163 --> 00:15:16.534
There are some web pages
like this, you know,

00:15:16.558 --> 00:15:21.261
but they take some nourishment
down from the databases,

00:15:21.285 --> 00:15:26.257
but people put prices on them,
stupid passwords and boring statistics.

00:15:26.281 --> 00:15:27.389
(Laughter)

00:15:27.413 --> 00:15:28.835
And this won't work.

00:15:28.859 --> 00:15:31.415
(Applause)

00:15:31.439 --> 00:15:33.861
So what is needed? We have the databases.

00:15:33.885 --> 00:15:35.752
It's not a new database that you need.

00:15:35.776 --> 00:15:39.581
We have wonderful design tools
and more and more are added up here.

00:15:39.605 --> 00:15:45.735
So we started a nonprofit venture
linking data to design,

00:15:45.759 --> 00:15:46.915
we called "Gapminder,"

00:15:46.939 --> 00:15:50.036
from the London Underground,
where they warn you, "Mind the gap."

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:52.019
So we thought Gapminder was appropriate.

00:15:52.043 --> 00:15:56.224
And we started to write software
which could link the data like this.

00:15:56.248 --> 00:15:57.795
And it wasn't that difficult.

00:15:57.819 --> 00:16:01.542
It took some person years,
and we have produced animations.

00:16:01.566 --> 00:16:03.799
You can take a data set and put it there.

00:16:03.823 --> 00:16:08.299
We are liberating UN data,
some few UN organization.

00:16:08.323 --> 00:16:12.601
Some countries accept that
their databases can go out on the world.

00:16:12.625 --> 00:16:15.870
But what we really need is,
of course, a search function,

00:16:15.894 --> 00:16:20.396
a search function where we can copy
the data up to a searchable format

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:21.938
and get it out in the world.

00:16:21.962 --> 00:16:24.127
And what do we hear when we go around?

00:16:24.151 --> 00:16:27.269
I've done anthropology
on the main statistical units.

00:16:27.293 --> 00:16:30.302
Everyone says, "It's impossible.
This can't be done.

00:16:30.326 --> 00:16:32.836
Our information is so peculiar in detail,

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:35.964
so that cannot be searched
as others can be searched.

00:16:35.988 --> 00:16:38.343
We cannot give the data
free to the students,

00:16:38.367 --> 00:16:40.493
free to the entrepreneurs of the world."

00:16:41.256 --> 00:16:43.602
But this is what we would
like to see, isn't it?

00:16:44.175 --> 00:16:46.599
The publicly funded data is down here.

00:16:46.623 --> 00:16:49.658
And we would like flowers
to grow out on the net.

00:16:49.682 --> 00:16:52.952
One of the crucial points
is to make them searchable,

00:16:52.976 --> 00:16:57.263
and then people can use the different
design tools to animate it there.

00:16:57.287 --> 00:16:59.581
And I have pretty good news for you.

00:16:59.605 --> 00:17:01.799
I have good news that the [current],

00:17:01.823 --> 00:17:05.309
new head of UN statistics
doesn't say it's impossible.

00:17:05.333 --> 00:17:07.189
He only says, "We can't do it."

00:17:07.772 --> 00:17:11.304
(Laughter)

00:17:11.328 --> 00:17:13.211
And that's a quite clever guy, huh?

00:17:13.235 --> 00:17:15.084
(Laughter)

00:17:15.108 --> 00:17:19.473
So we can see a lot happening
in data in the coming years.

00:17:19.497 --> 00:17:23.873
We will be able to look at income
distributions in completely new ways.

00:17:23.897 --> 00:17:28.976
This is the income distribution
of China, 1970.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.796
This is the income distribution
of the United States, 1970.

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:35.671
Almost no overlap.

00:17:35.695 --> 00:17:37.106
Almost no overlap.

00:17:37.130 --> 00:17:38.846
And what has happened?

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:40.351
What has happened is this:

00:17:40.375 --> 00:17:43.347
that China is growing,
it's not so equal any longer,

00:17:43.371 --> 00:17:47.342
and it's appearing here,
overlooking the United States,

00:17:47.366 --> 00:17:49.658
almost like a ghost, isn't it?

00:17:49.682 --> 00:17:50.976
(Laughter)

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.587
It's pretty scary.

00:17:52.611 --> 00:17:54.872
(Laughter)

00:17:57.762 --> 00:18:01.672
But I think it's very important
to have all this information.

00:18:01.696 --> 00:18:04.426
We need really to see it.

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:07.333
And instead of looking at this,

00:18:07.357 --> 00:18:12.740
I would like to end up by showing
the internet users per 1,000.

00:18:12.764 --> 00:18:15.688
In this software, we access
about 500 variables

00:18:15.712 --> 00:18:17.979
from all the countries quite easily.

00:18:18.003 --> 00:18:21.137
It takes some time to change for this,

00:18:21.161 --> 00:18:26.979
but on the axes, you can quite easily
get any variable you would like to have.

00:18:27.003 --> 00:18:31.386
And the thing would be
to get up the databases free,

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:34.219
to get them searchable,
and with a second click,

00:18:34.243 --> 00:18:39.299
to get them into the graphic formats,
where you can instantly understand them.

00:18:39.323 --> 00:18:42.749
Now, statisticians don't like it,
because they say

00:18:42.773 --> 00:18:49.690
that this will not show the reality;

00:18:49.714 --> 00:18:52.002
we have to have statistical,
analytical methods.

00:18:52.026 --> 00:18:53.976
But this is hypothesis-generating.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.905
I end now with the world.

00:18:57.021 --> 00:18:58.506
There, the internet is coming.

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:01.013
The number of internet users
are going up like this.

00:19:01.037 --> 00:19:03.148
This is the GDP per capita.

00:19:03.172 --> 00:19:06.672
And it's a new technology coming in,
but then amazingly,

00:19:06.696 --> 00:19:10.723
how well it fits to the economy
of the countries.

00:19:10.747 --> 00:19:13.739
That's why the $100 computer
will be so important.

00:19:13.763 --> 00:19:15.168
But it's a nice tendency.

00:19:15.192 --> 00:19:17.963
It's as if the world
is flattening off, isn't it?

00:19:17.987 --> 00:19:20.525
These countries are lifting more
than the economy,

00:19:20.549 --> 00:19:23.505
and it will be very interesting
to follow this over the year,

00:19:23.529 --> 00:19:27.179
as I would like you to be able to do
with all the publicly funded data.

00:19:27.203 --> 00:19:28.385
Thank you very much.

00:19:28.409 --> 00:19:31.409
(Applause)
