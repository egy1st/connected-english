WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Well, indeed, I'm very, very lucky.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
My talk essentially got written

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
by three historic events

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
that happened within days of each other

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
in the last two months --

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
seemingly unrelated, but as you will see,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
actually all having to do with

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
the story I want to tell you today.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The first one was actually a funeral --

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
to be more precise, a reburial.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
On May 22nd, there was a hero's reburial

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
in Frombork, Poland

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
of the 16th-century astronomer

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
who actually changed the world.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
He did that, literally,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
by replacing the Earth with the Sun

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
in the center of the Solar System,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and then with this simple-looking act,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
he actually launched a scientific

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and technological revolution,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
which many call the Copernican Revolution.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Now that was,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
ironically, and very befittingly,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
the way we found his grave.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
As it was the custom of the time,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Copernicus was actually

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
simply buried in an unmarked grave,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
together with 14 others

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
in that cathedral.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
DNA analysis,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
one of the hallmarks

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
of the scientific revolution

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
of the last 400 years that he started,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
was the way we found

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
which set of bones

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
actually belonged to the person

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
who read all those astronomical books

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
which were filled with leftover hair

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
that was Copernicus' hair --

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
obviously not many other people

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
bothered to read these books later on.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
That match was unambiguous.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
The DNA matched,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and we know that this was indeed

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Nicolaus Copernicus.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Now, the connection between

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
biology and DNA

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and life

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
is very tantalizing when you talk about Copernicus

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
because, even back then,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
his followers

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
very quickly made the logical step

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
to ask: if the Earth is just a planet,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
then what about planets around other stars?

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
What about the idea of the plurality of the worlds,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
about life on other planets?

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
In fact, I'm borrowing here from one of those

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
very popular books of the time.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And at the time,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
people actually answered that question

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
positively: "Yes."

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
But there was no evidence.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And here begins 400 years

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
of frustration, of unfulfilled dreams --

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
the dreams of Galileo, Giordano Bruno,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
many others --

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
which never led to the answer

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
of those very basic questions

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
which humanity has asked all the time.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
"What is life? What is the origin of life?

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Are we alone?"

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And that especially happened in the last 10 years,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
at the end of the 20th century,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
when the beautiful developments

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
due to molecular biology,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
understanding the code of life, DNA,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
all of that seemed to actually

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
put us, not closer,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
but further apart from answering

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
those basic questions.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Now, the good news.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
A lot has happened in the last few years,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
and let's start with the planets.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Let's start with the old Copernican question:

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Are there earths around other stars?

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
And as we already heard,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
there is a way in which

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
we are trying, and now able,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
to answer that question.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
It's a new telescope.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Our team, befittingly I think,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
named it after one of those dreamers

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
of the Copernican time,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Johannes Kepler,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and that telescope's sole purpose

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
is to go out,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
find the planets that orbit

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
other stars in our galaxy,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and tell us how often do planets like our own Earth

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
happen to be out there.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
The telescope is actually

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
built similarly to

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
the, well-known to you, Hubble Space Telescope,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
except it does have an additional lens --

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
a wide-field lens,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
as you would call it as a photographer.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And if, in the next couple of months,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
you walk out in the early evening

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
and look straight up

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and place you palm like this,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
you will actually be looking at the field of the sky

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
where this telescope is searching for planets

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
day and night, without any interruption,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
for the next four years.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
The way we do that, actually,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
is with a method, which we call the transit method.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
It's actually mini-eclipses that occur

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
when a planet passes in front of its star.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Not all of the planets will be fortuitously oriented

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
for us to be able do that,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
but if you have a million stars,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
you'll find enough planets.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
And as you see on this animation,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
what Kepler is going to detect

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
is just the dimming of the light from the star.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
We are not going to see the image of the star and the planet as this.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
All the stars for Kepler are just points of light.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
But we learn a lot from that:

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
not only that there is a planet there, but we also learn its size.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
How much of the light is being dimmed

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
depends on how big the planet is.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
We learn about its orbit,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
the period of its orbit and so on.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
So, what have we learned?

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Well, let me try to walk you through

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
what we actually see

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
and so you understand the news

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
that I'm here to tell you today.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
What Kepler does

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
is discover a lot of candidates,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
which we then follow up and find as planets,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
confirm as planets.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
It basically tells us

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
this is the distribution of planets in size.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
There are small planets, there are bigger planets, there are big planets, okay.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
So we count many, many such planets,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
and they have different sizes.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
We do that in our solar system.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
In fact, even back during the ancients,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
the Solar System in that sense

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
would look on a diagram like this.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
There will be the smaller planets, and there will be the big planets,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
even back to the time of Epicurus

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
and then of course Copernicus

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
and his followers.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Up until recently, that was the Solar System --

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
four Earth-like planets with small radius,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
smaller than about two times the size of the Earth --

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
and that was of course Mercury,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Venus, Mars,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
and of course the Earth,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
and then the two big, giant planets.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Then the Copernican Revolution

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
brought in telescopes,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
and of course three more planets were discovered.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Now the total planet number

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
in our solar system was nine.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
The small planets dominated,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
and there was a certain harmony to that,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
which actually Copernicus was very happy to note,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
and Kepler was one of the big proponents of.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
So now we have Pluto to join the numbers of small planets.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
But up until, literally, 15 years ago,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
that was all we knew about planets.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
And that's what the frustration was.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
The Copernican dream was unfulfilled.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Finally, 15 years ago,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
the technology came to the point

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
where we could discover a planet around another star,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
and we actually did pretty well.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
In the next 15 years,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
almost 500 planets

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
were discovered orbiting other stars, with different methods.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Unfortunately, as you can see,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
there was a very different picture.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
There was of course an explanation for it:

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
We only see the big planets,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
so that's why most of those planets

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
are really in the category of "like Jupiter."

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
But you see, we haven't gone very far.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
We were still back where Copernicus was.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
We didn't have any evidence

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
whether planets like the Earth are out there.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
And we do care about planets like the Earth

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
because by now we understood

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
that life as a chemical system

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
really needs a smaller planet

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
with water and with rocks

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
and with a lot of complex chemistry

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
to originate, to emerge, to survive.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And we didn't have the evidence for that.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
So today, I'm here to actually give you a first glimpse

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
of what the new telescope, Kepler,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
has been able to tell us in the last few weeks,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
and, lo and behold,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
we are back to the harmony

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
and to fulfilling the dreams of Copernicus.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
You can see here,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
the small planets dominate the picture.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
The planets which are marked "like Earth,"

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
[are] definitely more than

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
any other planets that we see.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
And now for the first time, we can say that.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
There is a lot more work we need to do with this.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Most of these are candidates.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
In the next few years we will confirm them.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
But the statistical result

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
is loud and clear.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
And the statistical result is that

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
planets like our own Earth

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
are out there.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Our own Milky Way Galaxy is rich in this kind of planets.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
So the question is: what do we do next?

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Well, first of all, we can study them

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
now that we know where they are.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
And we can find those that we would call habitable,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
meaning that they have similar conditions

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
to the conditions

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
that we experience here on Earth

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
and where a lot of complex chemistry can happen.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
So, we can even put a number

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
to how many of those planets

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
now do we expect our own

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Milky Way Galaxy harbors.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
And the number, as you might expect,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
is pretty staggering.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
It's about 100 million such planets.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
That's great news. Why?

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Because with our own little telescope,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
just in the next two years,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
we'll be able to identify at least 60 of them.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
So that's great because then

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
we can go and study them --

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
remotely, of course --

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
with all the techniques that we already have

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
tested in the past five years.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
We can find what they're made of,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
would their atmospheres have water, carbon dioxide, methane.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
We know and expect that we'll see that.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
That's great, but that is not the whole news.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
That's not why I'm here.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Why I'm here is to tell you that the next step

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
is really the exciting part.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
The one that this step

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
is enabling us to do is coming next.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
And here comes biology --

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
biology, with its basic question,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
which still stands unanswered,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
which is essentially:

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
"If there is life on other planets,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
do we expect it to be like life on Earth?"

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
And let me immediately tell you here,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
when I say life, I don't mean "dolce vita,"

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
good life, human life.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
I really mean life

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
on Earth, past and present,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
from microbes to us humans,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
in its rich molecular diversity,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
the way we now understand life on Earth

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
as being a set of molecules and chemical reactions --

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
and we call that, collectively, biochemistry,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
life as a chemical process,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
as a chemical phenomenon.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
So the question is:

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
is that chemical phenomenon universal,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
or is it something

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
which depends on the planet?

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Is it like gravity,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
which is the same everywhere in the universe,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
or there would be all kinds of different biochemistries

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
wherever we find them?

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
We need to know what we are looking for

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
when we try to do that.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
And that's a very basic question, which we don't know the answer to,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
but which we can try --

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
and we are trying -- to answer in the lab.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
We don't need to go to space

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
to answer that question.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
And so, that's what we are trying to do.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
And that's what many people now are trying to do.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
And a lot of the good news comes from that part of the bridge

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
that we are trying to build as well.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
So this is one example

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
that I want to show you here.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
When we think of what is necessary

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
for the phenomenon that we call life,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
we think of compartmentalization,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
keeping the molecules which are important for life

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
in a membrane,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
isolated from the rest of the environment,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
but yet, in an environment in which

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
they actually could originate together.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
And in one of our labs,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Jack Szostak's labs,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
it was a series of experiments

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
in the last four years

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
that showed that the environments --

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
which are very common on planets,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
on certain types of planets like the Earth,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
where you have some liquid water and some clays --

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
you actually end up with

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
naturally available molecules

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
which spontaneously form bubbles.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
But those bubbles have membranes

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
very similar to the membrane of every cell

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
of every living thing on Earth looks like,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
like this.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
And they really help molecules,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
like nucleic acids, like RNA and DNA,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
stay inside, develop,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
change, divide

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
and do some of the processes that we call life.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Now this is just an example

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
to tell you the pathway

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
in which we are trying to answer

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
that bigger question about the universality of the phenomenon.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
And in a sense, you can think of that work

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
that people are starting to do now around the world

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
as building a bridge,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
building a bridge from two sides of the river.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
On one hand, on the left bank of the river,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
are the people like me who study those planets

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
and try to define the environments.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
We don't want to go blind because there's too many possibilities,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
and there is not too much lab,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
and there is not enough human time

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
to actually to do all the experiments.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
So that's what we are building from the left side of the river.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
From the right bank of the river

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
are the experiments in the lab that I just showed you,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
where we actually tried that, and it feeds back and forth,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
and we hope to meet in the middle one day.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
So why should you care about that?

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Why am I trying to sell you

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
a half-built bridge?

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Am I that charming?

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
Well, there are many reasons,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
and you heard some of them

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
in the short talk today.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
This understanding of chemistry

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
actually can help us

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
with our daily lives.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
But there is something more profound here,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
something deeper.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
And that deeper, underlying point

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
is that science

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
is in the process of redefining life

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
as we know it.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
And that is going to change

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
our worldview in a profound way --

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
not in a dissimilar way

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
as 400 years ago,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Copernicus' act did,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
by changing the way

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
we view space and time.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Now it's about something else,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
but it's equally profound.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
And half the time,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
what's happened

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
is it's related this kind of

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
sense of insignificance

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
to humankind,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
to the Earth in a bigger space.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
And the more we learn,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
the more that was reinforced.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
You've all learned that in school --

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
how small the Earth is

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
compared to the immense universe.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
And the bigger the telescope,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
the bigger that universe becomes.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
And look at this image of the tiny, blue dot.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
This pixel is the Earth.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
It is the Earth as we know it.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
It is seen from, in this case,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
from outside the orbit of Saturn.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
But it's really tiny.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
We know that.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Let's think of life as that entire planet

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
because, in a sense, it is.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
The biosphere is the size of the Earth.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Life on Earth

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
is the size of the Earth.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
And let's compare it to the rest of the world

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
in spatial terms.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
What if that

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Copernican insignificance

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
was actually all wrong?

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Would that make us more responsible

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
for what is happening today?

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Let's actually try that.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
So in space, the Earth is very small.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Can you imagine how small it is?

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Let me try it.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Okay, let's say

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
this is the size

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
of the observable universe,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
with all the galaxies,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
with all the stars,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
okay, from here to here.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Do you know what the size of life

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
in this necktie will be?

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
It will be the size

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
of a single, small atom.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
It is unimaginably small.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
We can't imagine it.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
I mean look, you can see the necktie,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
but you can't even imagine seeing

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
the size of a little, small atom.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
But that's not the whole story, you see.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
The universe and life

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
are both in space and time.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
If that was

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
the age of the universe,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
then this is the age of life on Earth.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Think about those oldest living things on Earth,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
but in a cosmic proportion.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
This is not insignificant.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
This is very significant.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
So life might be insignificant in size,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
but it is not insignificant in time.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Life and the universe

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
compare to each other like a child and a parent,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
parent and offspring.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
So what does this tell us?

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
This tells us that

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
that insignificance paradigm

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
that we somehow got to learn

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
from the Copernican principle,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
it's all wrong.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
There is immense, powerful potential

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
in life in this universe --

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
especially now that we know

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
that places like the Earth are common.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
And that potential, that powerful potential,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
is also our potential,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
of you and me.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
And if we are to be stewards

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
of our planet Earth

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
and its biosphere,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
we'd better understand

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
the cosmic significance

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
and do something about it.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
And the good news is we can

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
actually, indeed do it.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
And let's do it.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
Let's start this new revolution

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
at the tail end of the old one,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
with synthetic biology being

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
the way to transform

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
both our environment

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
and our future.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
And let's hope that we can build this bridge together

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
and meet in the middle.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Thank you very much.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
(Applause)
