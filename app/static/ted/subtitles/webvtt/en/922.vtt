00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So let me just start with my story.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So I tore my knee joint meniscus cartilage

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
playing soccer in college.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Then I went on to tear my ACL, the ligament in my knee,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and then developed an arthritic knee.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And I'm sure that many of you in this audience have that same story,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and, by the way, I married a woman

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
who has exactly the same story.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So this motivated me to become an orthopedic surgeon

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and to see if I couldn't focus on solutions for those problems

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
that would keep me playing sports and not limit me.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So with that, let me just show you a quick video

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
to get you in the mood of what we're trying to explain.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Narrator: We are all aware of the risk of cancer,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
but there's another disease

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
that's destined to affect even more of us: arthritis.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Cancer may kill you, but when you look at the numbers,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
arthritis ruins more lives.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Assuming you live a long life, there's a 50 percent chance

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
you'll develop arthritis.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And it's not just aging that causes arthritis.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Common injuries can lead to decades of pain,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
until our joints quite literally grind to a halt.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Desperate for a solution, we've turned to engineering

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
to design artificial components

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
to replace our worn-out body parts,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
but in the midst of the modern buzz

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
around the promises of a bionic body,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
shouldn't we stop and ask if there's a better, more natural way?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Let's consider an alternative path.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
What if all the replacements our bodies need

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
already exist in nature,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
or within our own stem cells?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
This is the field of biologic replacements,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
where we replace worn-out parts with new, natural ones.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Kevin Stone: And so, the mission is:

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
how do I treat these things biologically?

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And let's talk about both what I did for my wife,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and what I've done for hundreds of other patients.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
First thing for my wife,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and the most common thing I hear from my patients,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
particularly in the 40- to 80-year-old age group, 70-year-old age group,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
is they come in and say,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
"Hey, Doc, isn't there just a shock absorber you can put in my knee?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I'm not ready for joint replacement."

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And so for her, I put in a human meniscus allograft donor

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
right into that [knee] joint space.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And [the allograft] replaces [the missing meniscus].

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And then for that unstable ligament,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
we put in a human donor ligament

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
to stabilize the knee.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And then for the damaged arthritis on the surface,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
we did a stem cell paste graft,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
which we designed in 1991,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
to regrow that articular cartilage surface

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and give it back a smooth surface there.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
So here's my wife's bad knee on the left,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
and her just hiking now

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
four months later in Aspen, and doing well.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
And it works, not just for my wife, but certainly for other patients.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
The girl on the video, Jen Hudak,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
just won the Superpipe in Aspen

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
just nine months after having destroyed her knee,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
as you see in the other image --

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and having a paste graft to that knee.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And so we can regrow these surfaces biologically.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
So with all this success,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
why isn't that good enough, you might ask.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Well the reason is because there's not enough donor cycles.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
There's not enough young, healthy people

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
falling off their motorcycle

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and donating that tissue to us.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
And the tissue's very expensive.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And so that's not going to be a solution

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
that's going to get us global with biologic tissue.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
But the solution is animal tissue

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
because it's plentiful, it's cheap,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
you can get it from young, healthy tissues,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
but the barrier is immunology.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And the specific barrier

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
is a specific epitope

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
called the galactosyl, or gal epitope.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
So if we're going to transplant animal tissues to people,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
we have to figure out a way to get rid of that epitope.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
So my story in working with animal tissues

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
starts in 1984.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And I started first

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
with cow Achilles tendon,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
where we would take the cow Achilles tendon,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
which is type-I collagen,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
strip it of its antigens

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
by degrading it with an acid and detergent wash

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and forming it into a regeneration template.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
We would then take that regeneration template

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
and insert it into the missing meniscus cartilage

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
to regrow that in a patient's knee.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
We've now done that procedure,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and it's been done worldwide in over 4,000 cases,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
so it's an FDA-approved and worldwide-accepted way

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
to regrow the meniscus.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And that's great when I can degrade the tissue.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
But what happens for your ligament when I need an intact ligament?

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
I can't grind it up in a blender.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
So in that case,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
I have to design -- and we designed with Uri Galili and Tom Turek --

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
an enzyme wash

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
to wash away, or strip,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
those galactosyl epitopes

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
with a specific enzyme.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
And we call that a "gal stripping" technique.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
What we do is humanize the tissue.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
It's by gal stripping that tissue

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
we humanize it (Laughter),

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
and then we can put it back

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
into a patient's knee.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
And we've done that. Now we've taken pig ligament --

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
young, healthy, big tissue,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
put it into 10 patients in an FDA-approved trial --

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
and then one of our patients went on to have

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
three Canadian Masters Downhill championships --

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
on his "pig-lig," as he calls it. So we know it can work.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And there's a wide clinical trial of this tissue now pending.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
So what about the next step?

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
What about getting to a total biologic knee replacement,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
not just the parts?

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
How are we going to revolutionize artificial joint replacement?

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Well here's how we're going to do it.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
So what we're going to do is take

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
an articular cartilage

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
from a young, healthy pig,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
strip it of its antigens,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
load it with your stem cells,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
then put it back on to that

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
arthritic surface in your knee,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
tack it on there, have you heal that surface

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
and then create a new biologic surface for your knee.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
So that's our biologic approach right now.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
We're going to rebuild your knee with the parts.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
We're going to resurface it with a completely new surface.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
But we have other advantages from the animal kingdom.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
There's a benefit of 400 million years

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
of ambulation.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
We can harness those benefits.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
We can use thicker, younger, better tissues

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
than you might have injured in your knee,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
or that you might have when you're 40, 50 or 60.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
We can do it as an outpatient procedure.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
We can strip that tissue very economically,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
and so this is how we can get biologic knee replacement

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
to go global.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
And so welcome to super biologics.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
It's not hardware.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
It's not software.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
It's bioware.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
It's version 2.0 of you.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
And so with that, coming to a --

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
(Laughter)

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
coming to an operating theater near you soon, I believe.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Thank you very much.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
(Applause)
