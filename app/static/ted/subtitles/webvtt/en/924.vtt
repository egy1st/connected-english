00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Today, I'm going to take you

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
around the world in 18 minutes.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
My base of operations is in the U.S.,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
but let's start at the other end of the map,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
in Kyoto, Japan,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
where I was living with a Japanese family

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
while I was doing part of my dissertational research

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
15 years ago.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I knew even then that I would encounter

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
cultural differences and misunderstandings,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
but they popped up when I least expected it.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
On my first day,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I went to a restaurant,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and I ordered a cup of green tea with sugar.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
After a pause, the waiter said,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
"One does not put sugar in green tea."

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
"I know," I said. "I'm aware of this custom.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
But I really like my tea sweet."

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
In response, he gave me an even more courteous version

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
of the same explanation.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
"One does not put sugar

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
in green tea."

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
"I understand," I said,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
"that the Japanese do not put sugar in their green tea,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
but I'd like to put some sugar

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
in my green tea."

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
(Laughter)

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Surprised by my insistence,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
the waiter took up the issue with the manager.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Pretty soon,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
a lengthy discussion ensued,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and finally the manager came over to me and said,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
"I am very sorry. We do not have sugar."

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
(Laughter)

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Well, since I couldn't have my tea the way I wanted it,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I ordered a cup of coffee,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
which the waiter brought over promptly.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Resting on the saucer

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
were two packets of sugar.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
My failure to procure myself

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
a cup of sweet, green tea

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
was not due to a simple misunderstanding.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
This was due to a fundamental difference

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
in our ideas about choice.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
From my American perspective,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
when a paying customer makes a reasonable request

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
based on her preferences,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
she has every right to have that request met.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
The American way, to quote Burger King,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
is to "have it your way,"

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
because, as Starbucks says,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
"happiness is in your choices."

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
(Laughter)

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
But from the Japanese perspective,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
it's their duty to protect those who don't know any better --

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
(Laughter)

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
in this case, the ignorant gaijin --

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
from making the wrong choice.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Let's face it: the way I wanted my tea

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
was inappropriate according to cultural standards,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and they were doing their best to help me save face.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Americans tend to believe

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
that they've reached some sort of pinnacle

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
in the way they practice choice.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
They think that choice, as seen through the American lens

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
best fulfills an innate and universal

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
desire for choice in all humans.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Unfortunately,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
these beliefs are based on assumptions

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
that don't always hold true

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
in many countries, in many cultures.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
At times they don't even hold true

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
at America's own borders.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
I'd like to discuss some of these assumptions

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and the problems associated with them.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
As I do so, I hope you'll start thinking

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
about some of your own assumptions

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
and how they were shaped by your backgrounds.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
First assumption:

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
if a choice affects you,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
then you should be the one to make it.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
This is the only way to ensure

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
that your preferences and interests

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
will be most fully accounted for.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
It is essential for success.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
In America, the primary locus of choice

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
is the individual.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
People must choose for themselves, sometimes sticking to their guns,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
regardless of what other people want or recommend.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
It's called "being true to yourself."

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
But do all individuals benefit

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
from taking such an approach to choice?

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Mark Lepper and I did a series of studies

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
in which we sought the answer to this very question.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
In one study,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
which we ran in Japantown, San Francisco,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
we brought seven- to nine-year-old Anglo- and Asian-American children

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
into the laboratory,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and we divided them up into three groups.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
The first group came in,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and they were greeted by Miss Smith,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
who showed them six big piles of anagram puzzles.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
The kids got to choose which pile of anagrams they would like to do,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
and they even got to choose which marker

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
they would write their answers with.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
When the second group of children came in,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
they were brought to the same room, shown the same anagrams,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
but this time Miss Smith told them

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
which anagrams to do

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
and which markers to write their answers with.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Now when the third group came in,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
they were told that their anagrams and their markers

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
had been chosen by their mothers.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
(Laughter)

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
In reality,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
the kids who were told what to do,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
whether by Miss Smith or their mothers,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
were actually given the very same activity,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
which their counterparts in the first group

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
had freely chosen.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
With this procedure, we were able to ensure

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
that the kids across the three groups

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
all did the same activity,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
making it easier for us to compare performance.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Such small differences in the way we administered the activity

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
yielded striking differences

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
in how well they performed.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Anglo-Americans,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
they did two and a half times more anagrams

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
when they got to choose them,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
as compared to when it was

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
chosen for them by Miss Smith or their mothers.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
It didn't matter who did the choosing,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
if the task was dictated by another,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
their performance suffered.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
In fact, some of the kids were visibly embarrassed

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
when they were told that their mothers had been consulted.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
(Laughter)

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
One girl named Mary said,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
"You asked my mother?"

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
(Laughter)

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
In contrast,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Asian-American children

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
performed best when they believed

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
their mothers had made the choice,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
second best when they chose for themselves,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
and least well when it had been chosen by Miss Smith.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
A girl named Natsumi

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
even approached Miss Smith as she was leaving the room

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
and tugged on her skirt and asked,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
"Could you please tell my mommy

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
I did it just like she said?"

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
The first-generation children were strongly influenced

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
by their immigrant parents'

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
approach to choice.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
For them, choice was not just a way

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
of defining and asserting

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
their individuality,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
but a way to create community and harmony

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
by deferring to the choices

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
of people whom they trusted and respected.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
If they had a concept of being true to one's self,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
then that self, most likely,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
[was] composed, not of an individual,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
but of a collective.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Success was just as much about pleasing key figures

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
as it was about satisfying

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
one's own preferences.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Or, you could say that

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
the individual's preferences were shaped

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
by the preferences of specific others.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
The assumption then that we do best

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
when the individual self chooses

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
only holds

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
when that self

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
is clearly divided from others.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
When, in contrast,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
two or more individuals

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
see their choices and their outcomes

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
as intimately connected,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
then they may amplify one another's success

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
by turning choosing

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
into a collective act.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
To insist that they choose independently

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
might actually compromise

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
both their performance

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
and their relationships.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Yet that is exactly what

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
the American paradigm demands.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
It leaves little room for interdependence

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
or an acknowledgment of individual fallibility.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
It requires that everyone treat choice

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
as a private and self-defining act.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
People that have grown up in such a paradigm

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
might find it motivating,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
but it is a mistake to assume

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
that everyone thrives under the pressure

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
of choosing alone.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
The second assumption which informs the American view of choice

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
goes something like this.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
The more choices you have,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
the more likely you are

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
to make the best choice.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
So bring it on, Walmart, with 100,000 different products,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
and Amazon, with 27 million books

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
and Match.com with -- what is it? --

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
15 million date possibilities now.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
You will surely find the perfect match.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Let's test this assumption

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
by heading over to Eastern Europe.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Here, I interviewed people

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
who were residents of formerly communist countries,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
who had all faced the challenge

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
of transitioning to a more

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
democratic and capitalistic society.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
One of the most interesting revelations

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
came not from an answer to a question,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
but from a simple gesture of hospitality.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
When the participants arrived for their interview,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
I offered them a set of drinks:

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Coke, Diet Coke, Sprite --

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
seven, to be exact.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
During the very first session,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
which was run in Russia,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
one of the participants made a comment

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
that really caught me off guard.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
"Oh, but it doesn't matter.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
It's all just soda. That's just one choice."

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
(Murmuring)

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
I was so struck by this comment that from then on,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
I started to offer all the participants

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
those seven sodas,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
and I asked them, "How many choices are these?"

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Again and again,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
they perceived these seven different sodas,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
not as seven choices, but as one choice:

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
soda or no soda.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
When I put out juice and water

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
in addition to these seven sodas,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
now they perceived it as only three choices --

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
juice, water and soda.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Compare this to the die-hard devotion of many Americans,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
not just to a particular flavor of soda,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
but to a particular brand.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
You know, research shows repeatedly

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
that we can't actually tell the difference

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
between Coke and Pepsi.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Of course, you and I know

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
that Coke is the better choice.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:01.000
(Laughter)

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
For modern Americans who are exposed

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
to more options and more ads associated with options

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
than anyone else in the world,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
choice is just as much about who they are

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
as it is about what the product is.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Combine this with the assumption that more choices are always better,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
and you have a group of people for whom every little difference matters

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
and so every choice matters.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
But for Eastern Europeans,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
the sudden availability of all these

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
consumer products on the marketplace was a deluge.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
They were flooded with choice

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
before they could protest that they didn't know how to swim.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
When asked, "What words and images

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
do you associate with choice?"

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Grzegorz from Warsaw said,

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
"Ah, for me it is fear.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
There are some dilemmas you see.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
I am used to no choice."

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Bohdan from Kiev said,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
in response to how he felt about

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
the new consumer marketplace,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
"It is too much.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
We do not need everything that is there."

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
A sociologist from

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
the Warsaw Survey Agency explained,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
"The older generation jumped from nothing

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
to choice all around them.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
They were never given a chance to learn

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
how to react."

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
And Tomasz, a young Polish man said,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
"I don't need twenty kinds of chewing gum.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
I don't mean to say that I want no choice,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
but many of these choices are quite artificial."

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
In reality, many choices are between things

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
that are not that much different.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
The value of choice

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
depends on our ability

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
to perceive differences

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
between the options.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Americans train their whole lives

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
to play "spot the difference."

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
They practice this from such an early age

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
that they've come to believe that everyone

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
must be born with this ability.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
In fact, though all humans share

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
a basic need and desire for choice,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
we don't all see choice in the same places

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
or to the same extent.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
When someone can't see how one choice

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
is unlike another,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
or when there are too many choices to compare and contrast,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
the process of choosing can be

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
confusing and frustrating.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Instead of making better choices,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
we become overwhelmed by choice,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
sometimes even afraid of it.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Choice no longer offers opportunities,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
but imposes constraints.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
It's not a marker of liberation,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
but of suffocation

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
by meaningless minutiae.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
In other words,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
choice can develop into the very opposite

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
of everything it represents

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
in America

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
when it is thrust upon those

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
who are insufficiently prepared for it.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
But it is not only other people

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
in other places

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
that are feeling the pressure

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
of ever-increasing choice.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Americans themselves are discovering

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
that unlimited choice

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
seems more attractive in theory

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
than in practice.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
We all have physical, mental

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
and emotional (Laughter) limitations

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
that make it impossible for us

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
to process every single choice we encounter,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
even in the grocery store,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
let alone over the course of our entire lives.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
A number of my studies have shown

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
that when you give people 10 or more options

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
when they're making a choice, they make poorer decisions,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
whether it be health care, investment,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
other critical areas.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
Yet still, many of us believe

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
that we should make all our own choices

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
and seek out even more of them.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
This brings me to the third,

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
and perhaps most problematic, assumption:

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
"You must never

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
say no to choice."

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
To examine this, let's go back to the U.S.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
and then hop across the pond to France.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Right outside Chicago,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
a young couple, Susan and Daniel Mitchell,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
were about to have their first baby.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
They'd already picked out a name for her,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Barbara, after her grandmother.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
One night, when Susan was seven months pregnant,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
she started to experience contractions

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
and was rushed to the emergency room.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
The baby was delivered through a C-section,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
but Barbara suffered cerebral anoxia,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
a loss of oxygen to the brain.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Unable to breathe on her own,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
she was put on a ventilator.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Two days later,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
the doctors gave the Mitchells

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
a choice:

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
They could either remove Barbara

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
off the life support,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
in which case she would die within a matter of hours,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
or they could keep her on life support,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
in which case she might still die

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
within a matter of days.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
If she survived, she would remain

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
in a permanent vegetative state,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
never able to walk, talk

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
or interact with others.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
What do they do?

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
What do any parent do?

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
In a study I conducted

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
with Simona Botti and Kristina Orfali,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
American and French parents

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
were interviewed.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
They had all suffered

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
the same tragedy.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
In all cases, the life support was removed,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
and the infants had died.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
But there was a big difference.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
In France, the doctors decided whether and when

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
the life support would be removed,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
while in the United States,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
the final decision rested with the parents.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
We wondered:

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
does this have an effect on how the parents

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
cope with the loss of their loved one?

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
We found that it did.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Even up to a year later,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
American parents

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
were more likely to express negative emotions,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
as compared to their French counterparts.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
French parents were more likely to say things like,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
"Noah was here for so little time,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
but he taught us so much.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
He gave us a new perspective on life."

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
American parents were more likely to say things like,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
"What if? What if?"

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Another parent complained,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
"I feel as if they purposefully tortured me.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
How did they get me to do that?"

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
And another parent said,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
"I feel as if I've played a role

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
in an execution."

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
But when the American parents were asked

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
if they would rather have had

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
the doctors make the decision,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
they all said, "No."

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
They could not imagine

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
turning that choice over to another,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
even though having made that choice

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
made them feel trapped,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
guilty, angry.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
In a number of cases

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
they were even clinically depressed.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
These parents could not contemplate

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
giving up the choice,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
because to do so would have gone contrary

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
to everything they had been taught

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
and everything they had come to believe

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
about the power

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
and purpose of choice.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
In her essay, "The White Album,"

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Joan Didion writes,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
"We tell ourselves stories

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
in order to live.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
We interpret what we see,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
select the most workable

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
of the multiple choices.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
We live entirely by the imposition

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
of a narrative line

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
upon disparate images,

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
by the idea with which we have learned to freeze

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
the shifting phantasmagoria,

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
which is our actual experience."

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
The story Americans tell,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
the story upon which

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
the American dream depends,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
is the story of limitless choice.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
This narrative

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
promises so much:

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
freedom, happiness,

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
success.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
It lays the world at your feet and says,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
"You can have anything, everything."

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
It's a great story,

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
and it's understandable why they would be reluctant

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
to revise it.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
But when you take a close look,

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
you start to see the holes,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
and you start to see that the story

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
can be told in many other ways.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
Americans have so often tried to

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
disseminate their ideas of choice,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
believing that they will be, or ought to be,

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
welcomed with open hearts and minds.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000
But the history books and the daily news tell us

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
it doesn't always work out that way.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
The phantasmagoria,

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
the actual experience that we try to understand

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
and organize through narrative,

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
varies from place to place.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
No single narrative serves the needs

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
of everyone everywhere.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Moreover, Americans themselves

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
could benefit from incorporating

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
new perspectives into their own narrative,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
which has been driving their choices

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
for so long.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
Robert Frost once said that,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
"It is poetry that is lost in translation."

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
This suggests that

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
whatever is beautiful and moving,

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
whatever gives us a new way to see,

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
cannot be communicated to those

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
who speak a different language.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
But Joseph Brodsky said that,

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
"It is poetry

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
that is gained in translation,"

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
suggesting that translation

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
can be a creative,

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
transformative act.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
When it comes to choice,

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
we have far more to gain than to lose

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
by engaging in the many

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000
translations of the narratives.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
Instead of replacing

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
one story with another,

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
we can learn from and revel in

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000
the many versions that exist

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000
and the many that have yet to be written.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000
No matter where we're from

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
and what your narrative is,

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
we all have a responsibility

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
to open ourselves up to a wider array

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
of what choice can do,

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000
and what it can represent.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000
And this does not lead to

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
a paralyzing moral relativism.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
Rather, it teaches us when

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
and how to act.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
It brings us that much closer

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000
to realizing the full potential of choice,

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
to inspiring the hope

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000
and achieving the freedom

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000
that choice promises

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
but doesn't always deliver.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000
If we learn to speak to one another,

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
albeit through translation,

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
then we can begin to see choice

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000
in all its strangeness,

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000
complexity

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
and compelling beauty.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000
Thank you.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:05.000
(Applause)

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Bruno Giussani: Thank you.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000
Sheena, there is a detail about your biography

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
that we have not written in the program book.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000
But by now it's evident to everyone in this room. You're blind.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000
And I guess one of the questions on everybody's mind is:

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
How does that influence your study of choosing

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
because that's an activity

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000
that for most people is associated with visual inputs

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000
like aesthetics and color and so on?

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
Sheena Iyengar: Well, it's funny that you should ask that

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000
because one of the things that's interesting about being blind

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
is you actually get a different vantage point

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000
when you observe the way

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000
sighted people make choices.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000
And as you just mentioned, there's lots of choices out there

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000
that are very visual these days.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
Yeah, I -- as you would expect --

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
get pretty frustrated by choices

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000
like what nail polish to put on

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000
because I have to rely on what other people suggest.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
And I can't decide.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000
And so one time I was in a beauty salon,

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000
and I was trying to decide between two very light shades of pink.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000
And one was called "Ballet Slippers."

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000
And the other one was called "Adorable."

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000
(Laughter)

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
And so I asked these two ladies,

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
and the one lady told me, "Well, you should definitely wear 'Ballet Slippers.'"

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000
"Well, what does it look like?"

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000
"Well, it's a very elegant shade of pink."

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
"Okay, great."

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.000
The other lady tells me to wear "Adorable."

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000
"What does it look like?"

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000
"It's a glamorous shade of pink."

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
And so I asked them, "Well, how do I tell them apart?

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000
What's different about them?"

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
And they said, "Well, one is elegant, the other one's glamorous."

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000
Okay, we got that.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:36.000
And the only thing they had consensus on:

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000
well, if I could see them, I would

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
clearly be able to tell them apart.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
(Laughter)

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000
And what I wondered was whether they were being affected

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000
by the name or the content of the color,

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000
so I decided to do a little experiment.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000
So I brought these two bottles of nail polish into the laboratory,

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000
and I stripped the labels off.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
And I brought women into the laboratory,

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000
and I asked them, "Which one would you pick?"

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000
50 percent of the women accused me of playing a trick,

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000
of putting the same color nail polish

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000
in both those bottles.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000
(Laughter)

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000
(Applause)

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000
At which point you start to wonder who the trick's really played on.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000
Now, of the women that could tell them apart,

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000
when the labels were off, they picked "Adorable,"

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000
and when the labels were on,

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000
they picked "Ballet Slippers."

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000
So as far as I can tell,

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000
a rose by any other name

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.000
probably does look different

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000
and maybe even smells different.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000
BG: Thank you. Sheena Iyengar. Thank you Sheena.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:46.000
(Applause)
