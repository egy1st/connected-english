00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I am a marine toxicologist,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and I've been very, very concerned about the Gulf,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
particularly about the massive applications

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
of the toxic dispersants,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
the Corexits.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I've been working on ocean pollution

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
for quite a long time --

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
the impacts on marine life and particularly the impacts

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
on marine mammals.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
As it turns out, marine mammals

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
are at the top of this food chain

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
that we're pouring millions of tons

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
of toxic substances into

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
every year.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And they are showing the signs of this.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I'm sorry to have a sad slide like this,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
but not everything is all that happy,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
especially in my work.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
They are loaded

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
with toxic chemicals in their body,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
hundreds of compounds,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
all kinds of compounds -- it's staggering.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And they're dying off rather regularly,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
tens of thousands around the world.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
It's predicted they may go extinct --

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
about a third of them --

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
within about 30 years.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So my project is along the Northwest Atlantic.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
It's called Seals as Sentinels.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
We're tracking pollution

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
at the top of the food web, in marine mammals and fish.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
It's a region-wide,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
eco-toxicological investigation.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
We're looking at a lot of compounds,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
but recently been quite interested in

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
the flame retardants, the brominated flame retardants

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
that are in many, many things

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
that we use in our everyday life,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
from the cushions in the chairs

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
we're all sitting on

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
to the plastic casings of our computers,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
our television sets and so on.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So we are tracking

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
how do these things get from

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
the products into the ocean,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
which is the final sink for them.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And there's quite a complicated pathway for that

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
because, as these products age,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
they get concentrated in dust,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and then they also get thrown out, so they go to the landfills.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
They wind up in waste water treatment plants.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
As you all know, we throw out billions

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
of computers and TVs every year.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
And those go to e-waste dumps.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And all that gets into surface waters,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
eventually reaching the ocean, the final sink.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
So, in our study,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
we did find quite high levels, as we expected,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
of these flame retardants in the harbor seals' bodies.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And we reported this.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
It led to a ban of this neuro-toxic flame retardant

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
called Deca in Maine, where I am based,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and also then a phase-out,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
U.S.-wide, at the end of last year.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
But we said, well, on the bright side,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
our harbor seals at least will not be

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
bursting into flame anytime soon.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
So then I got really curious,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
myself, as a toxicologist,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and I donated some blood to my lab

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
and said, "Okay, let's do it."

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Well, we detected 113 different compounds

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
in my blood.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And I must say, if any of you would have this done,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
you'd probably find a similar profile,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
or cocktail, as they call it.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
But I was the recipient

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
of a lot of flame retardant material for some reason.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
And just to point out the levels --

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Americans have 10 to 40 times higher

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
levels of these compounds in our bodies

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
than the Europeans.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Why? Because we are flame-retarding everything,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and we have weak regulations

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
for toxic chemicals.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
But lo and behold, I'm one of the high-end individuals.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Lucky me.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
But then I thought,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
well, in case of a fire, I might be the last one to ignite.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
(Laughter)

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
So anyway, here's the problem --

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and it is a problem that we're looking at in the Gulf today --

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
we're not regulating chemicals in this country properly.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
We're hardly regulating them at all.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
And we're letting industry run the show.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And Jackie Savitz spoke this morning

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
about Big Oil

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
and the propaganda

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and how we're all brainwashed

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
with their, you know, lies and so forth.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Well, Big Chemical

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
is what we're dealing with here.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And they're allowed to keep trade secrets,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
so they don't even give the ingredients out.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Plus they don't give health and safety data,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
so, consequently, they cannot be regulated

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
before they go to market.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
So it's a case of innocent until proven guilty.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
The burden of proof is not on the producer.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
So I then was invited to go

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
to the Gulf in May.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
I went down there on

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
a preliminary investigation

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
to look into dispersants

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
and how they're going into the water column and so forth.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
And I was told that I was

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
the only toxicologist to date

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
who was dumb enough to get into the water,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
but I did.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And we dove in the slick

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
without even HazMat gear.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
And I did get sick.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
I got a ferocious sore throat two days later.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
I felt like my throat was on fire.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
But it did pass.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
And what I did see in the water as we went down,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
what really shocked me -- and it's haunted me ever since --

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
because I could see the droplets of oil dispersing.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
And as you go down, they're catching all kinds of plankton,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
bumping into,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
you know, little wisps of life

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
that are the food for the planktivores,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
the herring kind of fish.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
And you could just see the web of death

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
as you go down in the water column.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Well, you know, we got into this

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
in the beginning

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
as a trade-off, they say,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
between the wetlands versus the ocean depth.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
And I didn't agree with that

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
decision at the time; I still don't.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
The decision was to protect the marshes.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
When the oil gets into the marshes, you can't get it out.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
And as you know, there's been a very weak response,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
up until recently,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
to actually collect the oil.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
It's gotten much more aggressive.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
This is an Exxon slide showing what happens,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
the scenario and the trade-off.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
So this shows oil on the surface.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
You can see it getting up into the mangrove,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
but it is not harming the corals

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
or the sea grass, right.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
So here we have the other scenario.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
If you disperse, the sea grass and the corals

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
are getting hit pretty hard,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
but you're saving the mangrove.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
So this, to me, is like going to the eye doctor, okay?

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Is it better with one or two?

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
(Laughter)

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
The problem is that we have

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
released so darn much of this stuff,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
we're climbing up to two million gallons

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
very quickly.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And then there's the problem of the plumes.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
What plumes?

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
It turns out there are plumes.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Independent researchers found that.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And then there's the looming,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
messy problem of human health,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
reported human health effects.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And actually, one of our federal officials

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
said that it was probably heat stress. So ...

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Having been in that water

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
just for the short time I was there,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
I can tell you, it is not heat stress.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
There are volumes of volatile

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
petroleum fumes coming off that water,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
plus the Corexit,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
which has solvent in it.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
So it is not at all rational.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
So what do we have? The BP show is going on.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Our officials complained about Corexit,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
which is the most toxic

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
line of dispersants.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
But heck, they're still using it,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
and they used the most toxic one, the 9527,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
until they ran out of supplies.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Now they're on 9500.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
9527 had 2-butoxyethanol in it

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
that causes internal bleeding.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
We know that from the Exxon Valdez spill, by the way.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
So what we're doing, we're putting compounds

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
with petroleum solvents onto a petroleum spill.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Does this make sense?

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
So this is the way it works.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
And I want to show you this cute little thing that happens here.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
It's a micelle.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Micelles form around the oil.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
And what happens first

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
is the solvents break into the oil,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
the lipid membrane,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
they let the surfactants in there.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
The surfactants -- which are like things

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
we use on fast food wrappers --

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
they grab around the droplets of oil,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
and they make little, tiny droplets

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
with nice, little

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
surfactant edges to them.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
The thing to remember about the micelles --

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
these little floating

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
globules of toxin --

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
is they are there to deliver.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
They're like the FedEx guys.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
And if you're a fish,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
and you haven't gotten your glob in the morning,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
you're going to get it in the afternoon,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
because they've got your number.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
So from a toxicology perspective,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
this is really awful

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
because Corexit and the dispersed oil

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
are much more toxic together

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
than either alone.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
And usually the exposure

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
is a combined exposure.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
The dispersants -- as I was saying --

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
their job is to break down

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
the lipid membrane.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
The solvents in them do that very efficiently.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
So they break down

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
lipid membranes in our body,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
starting with cells of the skin,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
the cells of organs.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
So it actually hastens

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
oil getting into the body

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
easily and readily.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Oil contains hundreds of hydrocarbon compounds

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
and other compounds

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
that are toxic to every organ in the body.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
And so with the dispersants combined,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
you have this very synergistic

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
combined toxicity.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Corexit also contains petroleum solvents

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
and many other toxic compounds.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
And I'm part of a chat group,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
which is a national group

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
of toxicologists and chemists

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
that are, you know, basically

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
turning cartwheels trying to figure out what's in this stuff,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
and what is it doing and what are the interactions

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
of these chemicals, most of which we don't know,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
and what are their byproducts,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
which are usually more toxic than the parent compound.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
So we did find that Corexit 9500

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
contains heavy metals, arsenic and chromium --

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
arsenic at high enough levels

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
to have cancer-causing effects.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000
So this is what we have to look at,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
these, you know, ridiculous safety data sheets,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
which have nothing on them much.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
And now they were forced to release the ultimate list

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
of everything that's in Corexit.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
And guess what,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
tons of stuff is missing.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Derivatives, derivatives, these are whole big groups

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
of many, many compounds, these sorbitans.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
And then you get down to the petroleum distillates,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
which are the solvents,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
hundreds of them.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
They are not identified. And why?

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Trade secrets again.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
BP's running the show,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
and the Nalco company, this is all they have to do.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
So far these ingredients have not been released,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
and toxicologists are actually going nuts

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
because we cannot predict with certainty

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
what the interactions

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
and toxic results are going to be.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
But we do have quite a lot at risk

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
down there, as we all know,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
the 33 wildlife refuges,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
so much wildlife

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
and fish and diversity.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
So we know from previous spills.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
And then part of this is just

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
part of my bad dreams.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
And I appreciate being able

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
to vent some of my

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
anguish upon you.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
What we do know is that the corals are going to get hit hard.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
And this is a study that was done

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
on the Australian coast,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
the coast of Tasmania.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Corals are, you know, the home to

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
about a quarter of all marine species.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
And with the Corexit

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
and the oil,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
there's zero percent fertilization.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
With oil alone, there's 98 percent fertilization.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
So they're a very sensitive species

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
to this combo.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Here's another group.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
I could see myself easily in the water column.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
The plankton and the plankton eaters,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
you know, these are the little herring fish

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
that go through the water column with their mouths open,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
feeding indiscriminately

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
and just lapping up

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
this brown pudding of toxic stuff.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
And we do know from other studies

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
that this is a highly toxic mixture.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
See the oil and Corexit is causing death

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
at a much, much lower dose

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
than oil alone.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
That's probably as far as what we do know

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
about toxic effects.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
But my bad dreams go like this.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
The piscivorous fish,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
the cobia, grouper, amberjacks, those big fish,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
also the tuna and sharks,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
are going to hit by this.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
And the gills are quite sensitive.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
The respiratory system is very sensitive.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Think about it with

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
the Corexit hitting the membranes,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
and it will clog up the gills,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
and then these animals are going to be

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
getting something like what you call

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
chemical pneumonia,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
trying to aspirate the compounds.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
It also will cause internal bleeding

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
upon ingestion.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
I'm very worried about the air-breathing mammals because I study them,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
but also, the way their going to be exposed

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
is every time they come to the surface to take a breath,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
they're going to inhale these volatile fumes.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
And what does happen with that eventually

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
is pneumonia sets in

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
and liver, kidney, brain damage.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
The Corexit

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
is transporting the oil

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
into every membrane

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
and every system of the body.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
And you're having

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
a lot of different unpleasant effects,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
but burns to the eyes and mouth,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
skin ulcers, lesions.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
And I think, personally,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
that we have not begun to see

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
the impacts of this spill

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
on the wildlife of the Gulf.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
We started hypothesizing:

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
what do we know?

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
what do with think would be a trophic cascade?

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
which means that somebody gets wiped out,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
and then everything above

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
that's eating those guys will crash.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
So our thought was --

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
this is a simple thinking process, but ...

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
obviously the plankton, the planktivores,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
and that's about as far as we got.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
And then it turns out we're not very good at figuring this stuff out.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
This is what the Exxon Valdez scientists thought would happen,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
this trophic cascade

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
where you lose the kelp and the herring

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
and other fishes and going up.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
They thought that eventually the killer whale

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
would be at the top of this cascade.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
And then here's what really happened,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
much more complicated, much more specific.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Actually the kelp

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
and the barnacles that attach to the rock

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
were decimated by the combination

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
of Corexit and the oil.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
They were replaced by invasive species,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
which had less holding power to the rock.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Storms came along.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
They ripped out of the rock.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
And this was the entire food web for the sea ducks.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
And as you know, we lost about 300,000 sea ducks

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
from the Exxon Valdez spill,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
and they haven't come back.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
So we are launching

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
an independent study.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
And by independent, I do not mean alone;

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
I mean independent in the sense

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
of not tied to

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
the kind of crime-scene secrecy

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
that's going on in the Gulf now.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
But we are actually going to be assessing toxic impacts,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
but we need lots and lots of partners

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
to do this intelligently.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
We have some of the partners lined up.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
And Dave Gallo signed on.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Sylvia's in here.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
And we hope that some of you will help us.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
My question to you is: why shouldn't we know?

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Don't we have the right to know?

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Surely we have the right to learn

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
what loss we are going through in the Gulf.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
And my wish would be --

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
for the gulf prize -- would be

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
that we have the truth.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Whatever it is, please let us have the truth.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
And to get there,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
we need to do the assessment.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
So I appreciate being here. Thank you.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
(Applause)
