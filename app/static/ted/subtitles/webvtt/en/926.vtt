00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
For a moment, what I need to do

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
is project something on the screen of your imagination.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We're in 17th century Japan

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
on the west coast,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and a little, wizened monk

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
is hurrying along, near midnight,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
to the crest of a small hill.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
He arrives on the small hill,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
dripping with water.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
He stands there,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and he looks across at the island, Sado.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And he scans across the ocean, and he looks at the sky.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Then he says to himself, very quietly,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
"[Turbulent the sea,]

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
[Stretching across to Sado]

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
[The Milky Way]."

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Basho was a brilliant man.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
He said more with less

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
than any human

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
that I have ever read or talked to.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Basho, in 17 syllables,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
juxtaposed

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
a turbulent ocean

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
driven by a storm now past,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and captured the almost

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
impossible beauty

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
of our home galaxy

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
with millions of stars,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
probably hundreds and hundreds of -- who knows how many -- planets,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
maybe even an ocean

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
that we will probably call Sylvia in time.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
As he was nearing his death,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
his disciples and followers

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
kept asking him,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
"What's the secret?

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
How can you

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
make haiku poems so beautiful so easily?"

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And toward the end, he said,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
"If you would know the pine tree,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
go to the pine tree."

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
That was it.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
(Laughter)

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Sylvia has said we must use

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
every capacity we have

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
in order to know the oceans.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
If we would know the oceans,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
we must go to the oceans.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And what I'd like to talk to you today about, a little bit,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
is really transforming

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
the relationship, or the interplay,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
between humans and oceans

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
with a new capability

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
that is not at all routine yet.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I hope it will be.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
There are a few key points.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
One of them is the oceans are central

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
to the quality of life on earth.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Another is that there are bold, new ways

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
of studying oceans

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
that we have not used well yet.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And the last is that these bold, new ways

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
that we are exploring

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
as a community

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
will transform the way we look at our planet, our oceans,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
and eventually how we manage

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
probably the entire planet, for what it's worth.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
So what scientists do when they begin

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
is to start with the system.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
They define what the system is.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
The system isn't Chesapeake Bay.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
It's not the Kuril arc. It's not even the entire Pacific.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
It's the whole planet,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
the entire planet, continents and oceans together.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
That's the system.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And basically, our challenge

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
is to optimize the benefits

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
and mitigate the risks

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
of living on a planet that's driven by only two processes,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
two sources of energy,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
one of which is solar,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
that drives the winds, the waves,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
the clouds, the storms and photosynthesis.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
The second one is internal energy.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And these two war against one another

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
almost continuously.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Mountain ranges, plate tectonics,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
moves the continents around, forms ore deposits.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Volcanoes erupt.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
That's the planet that we live on.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
It's immensely complex.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Now I don't expect all of you to see all the details here,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
but what I want you to see is

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
this is about 10 percent

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
of the processes that operate within

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
the oceans almost continuously,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
and have for the last 4 billion years.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
This is a system that's been around a very long time.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
And these have all co-evolved.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
What do I mean by that?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
They interact with one another constantly.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
All of them interact with one another.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
So the complexity of this system that we're looking at,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
the one driven by the sun --

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
upper portion, mostly --

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
and the lower portion is partly driven

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
by the input from heat below

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
and by other processes.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
This is very, very important

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
because this is the system, this is the crucible,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
out of which life on the planet came,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
and it's now time for us to understand it.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
We must understand it.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
That's one of the themes that Sylvia reminds us about:

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
understand this ocean of ours,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
this basic life support system,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
the dominant life support system on the planet.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Look at this complexity here.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
This is only one variable.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
If you can see the complexity,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
you can see how

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
tiny, little eddies

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
and large eddies and the motion --

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
this is just sea surface temperature,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
but it's immensely complicated.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Now a layer in,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
the other two or three hundred processes

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
that are all interacting,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
partly as a function of temperature, partly as a function of all the other factors,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
and you've got a really complicated system.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
That's our challenge, is to understand,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
understand this system in new and phenomenal ways.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
And there's an urgency to this.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Part of the urgency comes from the fact

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
that, of order, a billion people on the planet currently

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
are undernourished or starving.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And part of the issue

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
is for Cody --

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
who's here,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
16 years old --

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
and I have permission to relay this number.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
When he, 40 years from now,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
is the age of Nancy Brown,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
there are going to be

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
another two and a half billion people on the planet.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
We can't solve all the problems

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
by looking only at the oceans,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
but if we don't understand

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
the fundamental life support system of this planet

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
much more thoroughly than we do now,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
then the stresses that we will face,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
and that Cody will face,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
and even Nancy, who's going to live till she's 98,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
will have really problems coping.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
All right, let's talk about another perspective

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
on the importance of the oceans.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Look at this diagram, which is showing

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
warm waters in red,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
cool waters in blue,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
and on the continents, what you're seeing in bright green,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
is the growth of vegetation,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
and in olive green, the dieback of vegetation.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And in the lower left hand corner there's a clock ticking away

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
from 1982 to 1998

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
and then cycling again.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
What you'll see is that the rhythms

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
of growth, of vegetation --

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
a subset of which is food on the continents --

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
is directly tied to the rhythms

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
of the sea surface temperatures.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
The oceans control,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
or at least significantly influence,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
correlate with,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
the growth patterns and the drought patterns

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
and the rain patterns on the continents.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
So people in Kansas, in a wheat field in Kansas,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
need to understand that the oceans

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
are central to them as well.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Another complexity: this is the age of the oceans.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
I'm going to layer in on top of this

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
the tectonic plates.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
The age of the ocean, the tectonic plates,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
gives rise to a totally new phenomenon

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
that we have heard about

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
in this conference.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
And I share with you some very high-definition video

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
that we collected in real time.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Seconds after this video was taken,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
people in Beijing,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
people in Sydney, people in Amsterdam,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
people in Washington D.C. were watching this.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Now you've heard of hydrothermal vents,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
but the other discovery

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
is that deep below the sea floor,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
there is vast reservoir of microbial activity,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
which we have only just discovered

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
and we have almost no way to study.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Some people have estimated

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
that the biomass

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
tied up in these microbes

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
living in the pours and the cracks

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
of the sea floor and below

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
rival the total amount of living biomass

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
at the surface of the planet.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
It's an astonishing insight,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
and we have only found out about this recently.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
This is very, very exciting.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
It may be the next rainforest,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
in terms of pharmaceuticals.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
We know little or nothing about it.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Well, Marcel Proust has this wonderful saying

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
that, "The real voyage of discovery

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
consists not so much in seeking new territory,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
but possibly in having new sets of eyes,"

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
new ways of seeing things,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
a new mindset.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
And many of you remember

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
the early stages of oceanography,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
when we had to use what we had at our fingertips.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
And it wasn't easy. It wasn't easy in those days.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Some of you remember this, I'm sure.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And now, we have an entire suite of tools

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
that are really pretty powerful --

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
ships, satellites, moorings.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
But they don't quite cut it. They don't quite give us what we need.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
And the program that I wanted to talk to you about

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
just a little bit here,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
was funded, and it involves autonomous vehicles

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
like the one running across the base of this image.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Modeling: on the right hand side,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
there's a very complex computational model.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
On the left hand side, there's a new type of mooring,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
which I'll show you in just a second.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
And on the basis

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
of several points,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
the oceans are complex, and they're central to the life on earth.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
They are changing rapidly, but not predictably.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
And the models that we need to predict the future

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
do not have enough data to refine them.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
The computational power

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
is amazing.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
But without data, those models

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
will never ever be predicted.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
And that's what we really need.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
For a variety of reasons they're dangerous,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
but we feel that OOI,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
this Ocean Observatory Initiative,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
which the National Science Foundation

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
has begun to fund,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
has the potential to really transform things.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
And the goal of the program is to

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
launch an era of scientific discovery

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
and understanding

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
across and within the ocean basins,

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
utilizing widely accessible,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
interactive telepresence.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
It's a new world.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
We will be present throughout

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
the volume of the ocean, at will,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
communicating in real time.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
And this is what the system involves,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
a number of sites in the southern hemisphere,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
shown in those circles.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
And in the northern hemisphere there are four sites.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
I won't talk a lot about most of them right here,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
but the one on the west coast, that's in the box,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
is called the regional scale nodes.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
It was once called Neptune.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
And let me show you what's behind it.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Fiber: next-generation way of communicating.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
You can see the copper tips on these things.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
You can transmit power,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
but the bandwidth is in those tiny, little threads

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
smaller than the hair on your head in diameter.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
And this particular set here

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
can transmit something of the order of

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
three to five terabits per second.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
This is phenomenal bandwidth.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
And this is what the planet looks like.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
We are already laced up

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
as if we're in a fiber optic corset, if you like.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
This is what it looks like.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
And the cables go really continent to continent.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
It's a very powerful system,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
and most of our communications consist of it.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
So this is the system that I'm talking about,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
off the west coast. It's coincident with the tectonic plate,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And it's going to deliver abundant power

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
and unprecedented bandwidth

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
across this entire volume --

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
in the overlying ocean,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
on the sea floor and below the sea floor.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Bandwidth and power

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
and a wide variety of processes

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
that will be operating.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
This is what one of those primary nodes looks like,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
and it's like a sub station with power and bandwidth

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
that can spread out over an area the size of Seattle.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
And the kind of science that can be done

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
will be determined by a variety of scientists who want to be involved

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
and can bring the instrumentation to the table.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
They will bring it and link it in.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
It'll be, in a sense, like having time on a telescope,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
except you'll have your own port.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Climate change, ocean acidification,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
dissolved oxygen,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
carbon cycle, coastal upwelling,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
fishing dynamics --

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
the full spectrum of

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
earth science and ocean science

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
simultaneously in the same volume.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
So anyone coming along later

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
simply accesses the database

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
and can draw down the information they need

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
about anything that has taken place.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
And this is just the first of these.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
In conjunction with our Canadian colleagues, we've set this up.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Now I want to take you into the caldera.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
On the left hand side there

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
is a large volcano called Axial Seamount.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
And we're going to go down into the Axial Seamount

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
using animation.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Here's what this system is going to look like

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
that we are funded to build at this point.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Very powerful.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
That's an elevator that's constantly moving up and down,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
but it can be controlled by the folks on land

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
who are responsible for it.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Or they can transfer control

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
to someone in India or China

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
who can take over for a while,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
because it's all going to be directly connected

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
through the Internet.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
There will be massive amounts of data flowing ashore,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
all available to anyone who has any interest in using it.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
This is going to be much more powerful

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
than having a single ship

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
in a single location,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
then move to a new location.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
We're flying across the caldera floor.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
There is a number of robotic systems.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
There's cameras that can be turned on and off at your will,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
if those are your experiments.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
The kinds of systems that will be down there,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
the kinds of instruments that will be on the sea floor,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
consist of -- if you can read them there --

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
there's cameras, there's pressure sensors,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
fluorometers, there's seismometers.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
It's a full spectrum of tools.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Now, that mound right there

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
actually looks like this.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
This is what it actually looks like.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
And this is the kind of activity

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
that we can see with high-definition video,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
because the bandwidth of these cables

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
is so huge

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
that we could have five to 10

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
stereo HD systems

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
running continuously

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
and, again, directed through robotic techniques from land.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Very, very powerful.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
And these are the things that we're funded to do today.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
So what can we actually do tomorrow?

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
We're about to ride the wave

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
of technological opportunity.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
There are emerging technologies throughout

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
the field around oceanography,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
which we will incorporate into oceanography,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
and through that convergence,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
we will transform oceanography into something even more magical.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Robotics systems are just incredible these days,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
absolutely incredible.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
And we will be bringing robotics of all sorts

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
into the ocean.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Nanotechnology: this is a small generator.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
It's smaller than a postage stamp,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
and it can generate power just by being

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
attached to your shirt as you move.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Just as you move, it generates power.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
There are many kinds of things that can be used in the ocean, continuously.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Imaging: Many of you know a good deal more about this type of thing than I,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
but stereo imaging at four times the definition

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
that we have in HD

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
will be routine within five years.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
And this is the magic one.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
As a result of the human genome process,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
we are in a situation where

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
events that take place in the ocean --

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
like an erupting volcano, or something of that sort --

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
can actually be sampled.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
We pump the fluid through one of these systems,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
and we press the button,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
and it's analyzed for the genomic character.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
And that's transmitted back to land immediately.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
So in the volume of the ocean,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
we will know, not just the physics and the chemistry,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
but the base of the food chain

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
will be transparent to us

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
with data on a continuous basis.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Grid computing: the power of grid computers

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
is going to be just amazing here.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
We will soon be using grid computing

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
to do pretty much everything, like adjust the data

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
and everything

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
that goes with the data.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
The power generation will come from the ocean itself.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
And the next generation fiber

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
will be simply magic.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
It's far beyond what we currently have.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
So the presence of the power

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
and the bandwidth in the environment

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
will allow all of these new technologies

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
to converge in a manner that is just unprecedented.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
So within five to seven years,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
I see us having

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
a capacity to be completely present

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
throughout the ocean

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
and have all of that connected to the Internet,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
so we can reach many, many folks.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000
Delivering the power and the bandwidth into the ocean

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
will dramatically accelerate adaptation.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Here's an example.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000
When earthquakes take place, massive amounts

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
of these new microbes we've never seen before

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000
come out of the sea floor.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
We have a way of addressing that,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
a new way of addressing that.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
We've determined from the earthquake activity that you're seeing here

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
that the top of that volcano is erupting,

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
so we deploy the troops.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
What are the troops? The troops are the autonomous vehicles, of course.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
And they fly into the erupting volcano.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
They sample the fluids coming out of the sea floor

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
during an eruption,

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
which have the microbes that have never been

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
to the surface of the planet before.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
They eject it to the surface where it floats,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
and it is picked up

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
by an autonomous airplane,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
and it's brought back to the laboratory

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
within 24 hours of the eruption.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
This is doable. All the pieces are there.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
A laboratory: many of you heard what happened

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
on 9/7.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
Some doctors in New York City removed

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
the gallbladder of a woman in France.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
We could do work on the sea floor that would be stunning,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
and it would be on live TV,

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
if we have interesting things to show.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
So we can bring an entirely new telepresence

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
to the world, throughout the ocean.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
This -- I've shown you sea floor --

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
but so the goal here is real time interaction

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
with the oceans from anywhere on earth.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
It's going to be amazing.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
And as I go here,

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000
I just want to show you what we can bring into classrooms,

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000
and indeed, what we can bring into your pocket.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Many of you don't think of this yet,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
but the ocean will be in your pocket.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
It won't be long. It won't be long.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000
So let me leave you then

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
with a few words

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
from another poet, if you'll forgive me.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
In 1943,

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
T.S. Eliot wrote the "Four Quartets."

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
He won the Nobel Prize for literature

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
in 1948.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
In "Little Gidding" he says --

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
speaking I think for the human race,

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
but certainly for the TED Conference and Sylvia --

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000
"We shall not cease from exploration,

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
and the end of all our exploring

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.000
will be to arrive where we started

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000
and know the place for the first time,

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000
arrive through the unknown remembered gate

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000
where the last of earth left to discover

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000
is that which was the beginning.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000
At the source of the longest river

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000
the voice of a hidden waterfall

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000
not known because not looked for,

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000
but heard, half heard

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000
in the stillness beneath the waves of the sea."

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
Thank you.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:27.000
(Applause)
