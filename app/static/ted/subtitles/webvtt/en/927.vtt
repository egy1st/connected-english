00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I want to start my talk today with two observations

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
about the human species.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The first observation is something that you might think is quite obvious,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and that's that our species, Homo sapiens,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
is actually really, really smart --

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
like, ridiculously smart --

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
like you're all doing things

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that no other species on the planet does right now.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And this is, of course,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
not the first time you've probably recognized this.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Of course, in addition to being smart, we're also an extremely vain species.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So we like pointing out the fact that we're smart.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
You know, so I could turn to pretty much any sage

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
from Shakespeare to Stephen Colbert

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
to point out things like the fact that

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
we're noble in reason and infinite in faculties

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and just kind of awesome-er than anything else on the planet

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
when it comes to all things cerebral.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
But of course, there's a second observation about the human species

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
that I want to focus on a little bit more,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and that's the fact that

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
even though we're actually really smart, sometimes uniquely smart,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
we can also be incredibly, incredibly dumb

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
when it comes to some aspects of our decision making.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Now I'm seeing lots of smirks out there.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Don't worry, I'm not going to call anyone in particular out

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
on any aspects of your own mistakes.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
But of course, just in the last two years

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
we see these unprecedented examples of human ineptitude.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And we've watched as the tools we uniquely make

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
to pull the resources out of our environment

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
kind of just blow up in our face.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
We've watched the financial markets that we uniquely create --

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
these markets that were supposed to be foolproof --

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
we've watched them kind of collapse before our eyes.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
But both of these two embarrassing examples, I think,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
don't highlight what I think is most embarrassing

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
about the mistakes that humans make,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
which is that we'd like to think that the mistakes we make

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
are really just the result of a couple bad apples

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
or a couple really sort of FAIL Blog-worthy decisions.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
But it turns out, what social scientists are actually learning

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
is that most of us, when put in certain contexts,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
will actually make very specific mistakes.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
The errors we make are actually predictable.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
We make them again and again.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And they're actually immune to lots of evidence.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
When we get negative feedback,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
we still, the next time we're face with a certain context,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
tend to make the same errors.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And so this has been a real puzzle to me

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
as a sort of scholar of human nature.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
What I'm most curious about is,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
how is a species that's as smart as we are

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
capable of such bad

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and such consistent errors all the time?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
You know, we're the smartest thing out there, why can't we figure this out?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
In some sense, where do our mistakes really come from?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
And having thought about this a little bit, I see a couple different possibilities.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
One possibility is, in some sense, it's not really our fault.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Because we're a smart species,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
we can actually create all kinds of environments

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
that are super, super complicated,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
sometimes too complicated for us to even actually understand,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
even though we've actually created them.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
We create financial markets that are super complex.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
We create mortgage terms that we can't actually deal with.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And of course, if we are put in environments where we can't deal with it,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
in some sense makes sense that we actually

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
might mess certain things up.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
If this was the case, we'd have a really easy solution

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
to the problem of human error.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
We'd actually just say, okay, let's figure out

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
the kinds of technologies we can't deal with,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
the kinds of environments that are bad --

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
get rid of those, design things better,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
and we should be the noble species

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
that we expect ourselves to be.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
But there's another possibility that I find a little bit more worrying,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
which is, maybe it's not our environments that are messed up.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Maybe it's actually us that's designed badly.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
This is a hint that I've gotten

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
from watching the ways that social scientists have learned about human errors.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And what we see is that people tend to keep making errors

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
exactly the same way, over and over again.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
It feels like we might almost just be built

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
to make errors in certain ways.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
This is a possibility that I worry a little bit more about,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
because, if it's us that's messed up,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
it's not actually clear how we go about dealing with it.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
We might just have to accept the fact that we're error prone

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
and try to design things around it.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
So this is the question my students and I wanted to get at.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
How can we tell the difference between possibility one and possibility two?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
What we need is a population

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
that's basically smart, can make lots of decisions,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
but doesn't have access to any of the systems we have,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
any of the things that might mess us up --

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
no human technology, human culture,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
maybe even not human language.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And so this is why we turned to these guys here.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
These are one of the guys I work with. This is a brown capuchin monkey.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
These guys are New World primates,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
which means they broke off from the human branch

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
about 35 million years ago.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
This means that your great, great, great great, great, great --

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
with about five million "greats" in there --

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
grandmother was probably the same great, great, great, great

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
grandmother with five million "greats" in there

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
as Holly up here.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
You know, so you can take comfort in the fact that this guy up here is a really really distant,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
but albeit evolutionary, relative.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
The good news about Holly though is that

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
she doesn't actually have the same kinds of technologies we do.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
You know, she's a smart, very cut creature, a primate as well,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
but she lacks all the stuff we think might be messing us up.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
So she's the perfect test case.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
What if we put Holly into the same context as humans?

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Does she make the same mistakes as us?

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Does she not learn from them? And so on.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
And so this is the kind of thing we decided to do.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
My students and I got very excited about this a few years ago.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
We said, all right, let's, you know, throw so problems at Holly,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
see if she messes these things up.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
First problem is just, well, where should we start?

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Because, you know, it's great for us, but bad for humans.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
We make a lot of mistakes in a lot of different contexts.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
You know, where are we actually going to start with this?

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
And because we started this work around the time of the financial collapse,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
around the time when foreclosures were hitting the news,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
we said, hhmm, maybe we should

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
actually start in the financial domain.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Maybe we should look at monkey's economic decisions

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
and try to see if they do the same kinds of dumb things that we do.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Of course, that's when we hit a sort second problem --

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
a little bit more methodological --

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
which is that, maybe you guys don't know,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
but monkeys don't actually use money. I know, you haven't met them.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
But this is why, you know, they're not in the queue behind you

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
at the grocery store or the ATM -- you know, they don't do this stuff.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
So now we faced, you know, a little bit of a problem here.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
How are we actually going to ask monkeys about money

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
if they don't actually use it?

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
So we said, well, maybe we should just, actually just suck it up

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
and teach monkeys how to use money.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
So that's just what we did.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
What you're looking at over here is actually the first unit that I know of

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
of non-human currency.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
We weren't very creative at the time we started these studies,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
so we just called it a token.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
But this is the unit of currency that we've taught our monkeys at Yale

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
to actually use with humans,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
to actually buy different pieces of food.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
It doesn't look like much -- in fact, it isn't like much.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Like most of our money, it's just a piece of metal.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
As those of you who've taken currencies home from your trip know,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
once you get home, it's actually pretty useless.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
It was useless to the monkeys at first

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
before they realized what they could do with it.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
When we first gave it to them in their enclosures,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
they actually kind of picked them up, looked at them.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
They were these kind of weird things.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
But very quickly, the monkeys realized

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
that they could actually hand these tokens over

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
to different humans in the lab for some food.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
And so you see one of our monkeys, Mayday, up here doing this.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
This is A and B are kind of the points where she's sort of a little bit

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
curious about these things -- doesn't know.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
There's this waiting hand from a human experimenter,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
and Mayday quickly figures out, apparently the human wants this.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Hands it over, and then gets some food.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
It turns out not just Mayday, all of our monkeys get good

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
at trading tokens with human salesman.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
So here's just a quick video of what this looks like.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Here's Mayday. She's going to be trading a token for some food

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
and waiting happily and getting her food.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Here's Felix, I think. He's our alpha male; he's a kind of big guy.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
But he too waits patiently, gets his food and goes on.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
So the monkeys get really good at this.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
They're surprisingly good at this with very little training.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
We just allowed them to pick this up on their own.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
The question is: is this anything like human money?

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Is this a market at all,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
or did we just do a weird psychologist's trick

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
by getting monkeys to do something,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
looking smart, but not really being smart.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
And so we said, well, what would the monkeys spontaneously do

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
if this was really their currency, if they were really using it like money?

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Well, you might actually imagine them

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
to do all the kinds of smart things

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
that humans do when they start exchanging money with each other.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
You might have them start paying attention to price,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
paying attention to how much they buy --

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
sort of keeping track of their monkey token, as it were.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Do the monkeys do anything like this?

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
And so our monkey marketplace was born.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
The way this works is that

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
our monkeys normally live in a kind of big zoo social enclosure.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
When they get a hankering for some treats,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
we actually allowed them a way out

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
into a little smaller enclosure where they could enter the market.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Upon entering the market --

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
it was actually a much more fun market for the monkeys than most human markets

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
because, as the monkeys entered the door of the market,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
a human would give them a big wallet full of tokens

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
so they could actually trade the tokens

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
with one of these two guys here --

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
two different possible human salesmen

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
that they could actually buy stuff from.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
The salesmen were students from my lab.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
They dressed differently; they were different people.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
And over time, they did basically the same thing

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
so the monkeys could learn, you know,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
who sold what at what price -- you know, who was reliable, who wasn't, and so on.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
And you can see that each of the experimenters

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
is actually holding up a little, yellow food dish.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
and that's what the monkey can for a single token.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
So everything costs one token,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
but as you can see, sometimes tokens buy more than others,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
sometimes more grapes than others.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
So I'll show you a quick video of what this marketplace actually looks like.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Here's a monkey-eye-view. Monkeys are shorter, so it's a little short.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
But here's Honey.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
She's waiting for the market to open a little impatiently.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
All of a sudden the market opens. Here's her choice: one grapes or two grapes.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
You can see Honey, very good market economist,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
goes with the guy who gives more.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
She could teach our financial advisers a few things or two.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
So not just Honey,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
most of the monkeys went with guys who had more.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Most of the monkeys went with guys who had better food.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
When we introduced sales, we saw the monkeys paid attention to that.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
They really cared about their monkey token dollar.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
The more surprising thing was that when we collaborated with economists

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
to actually look at the monkeys' data using economic tools,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
they basically matched, not just qualitatively,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
but quantitatively with what we saw

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
humans doing in a real market.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
So much so that, if you saw the monkeys' numbers,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
you couldn't tell whether they came from a monkey or a human in the same market.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
And what we'd really thought we'd done

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
is like we'd actually introduced something

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
that, at least for the monkeys and us,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
works like a real financial currency.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Question is: do the monkeys start messing up in the same ways we do?

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Well, we already saw anecdotally a couple of signs that they might.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
One thing we never saw in the monkey marketplace

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
was any evidence of saving --

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
you know, just like our own species.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
The monkeys entered the market, spent their entire budget

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
and then went back to everyone else.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
The other thing we also spontaneously saw,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
embarrassingly enough,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
is spontaneous evidence of larceny.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
The monkeys would rip-off the tokens at every available opportunity --

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
from each other, often from us --

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
you know, things we didn't necessarily think we were introducing,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
but things we spontaneously saw.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
So we said, this looks bad.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Can we actually see if the monkeys

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
are doing exactly the same dumb things as humans do?

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
One possibility is just kind of let

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
the monkey financial system play out,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
you know, see if they start calling us for bailouts in a few years.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
We were a little impatient so we wanted

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
to sort of speed things up a bit.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
So we said, let's actually give the monkeys

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
the same kinds of problems

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
that humans tend to get wrong

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
in certain kinds of economic challenges,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
or certain kinds of economic experiments.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
And so, since the best way to see how people go wrong

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
is to actually do it yourself,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
I'm going to give you guys a quick experiment

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
to sort of watch your own financial intuitions in action.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
So imagine that right now

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
I handed each and every one of you

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
a thousand U.S. dollars -- so 10 crisp hundred dollar bills.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Take these, put it in your wallet

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
and spend a second thinking about what you're going to do with it.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Because it's yours now; you can buy whatever you want.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Donate it, take it, and so on.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Sounds great, but you get one more choice to earn a little bit more money.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
And here's your choice: you can either be risky,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
in which case I'm going to flip one of these monkey tokens.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
If it comes up heads, you're going to get a thousand dollars more.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
If it comes up tails, you get nothing.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
So it's a chance to get more, but it's pretty risky.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Your other option is a bit safe. Your just going to get some money for sure.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
I'm just going to give you 500 bucks.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
You can stick it in your wallet and use it immediately.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
So see what your intuition is here.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Most people actually go with the play-it-safe option.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Most people say, why should I be risky when I can get 1,500 dollars for sure?

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
This seems like a good bet. I'm going to go with that.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
You might say, eh, that's not really irrational.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
People are a little risk-averse. So what?

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Well, the "so what?" comes when start thinking

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
about the same problem

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
set up just a little bit differently.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
So now imagine that I give each and every one of you

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
2,000 dollars -- 20 crisp hundred dollar bills.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Now you can buy double to stuff you were going to get before.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Think about how you'd feel sticking it in your wallet.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
And now imagine that I have you make another choice

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
But this time, it's a little bit worse.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Now, you're going to be deciding how you're going to lose money,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
but you're going to get the same choice.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
You can either take a risky loss --

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
so I'll flip a coin. If it comes up heads, you're going to actually lose a lot.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
If it comes up tails, you lose nothing, you're fine, get to keep the whole thing --

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
or you could play it safe, which means you have to reach back into your wallet

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
and give me five of those $100 bills, for certain.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And I'm seeing a lot of furrowed brows out there.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
So maybe you're having the same intuitions

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
as the subjects that were actually tested in this,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
which is when presented with these options,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
people don't choose to play it safe.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
They actually tend to go a little risky.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
The reason this is irrational is that we've given people in both situations

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
the same choice.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
It's a 50/50 shot of a thousand or 2,000,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
or just 1,500 dollars with certainty.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
But people's intuitions about how much risk to take

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
varies depending on where they started with.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
So what's going on?

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Well, it turns out that this seems to be the result

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
of at least two biases that we have at the psychological level.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
One is that we have a really hard time thinking in absolute terms.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
You really have to do work to figure out,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
well, one option's a thousand, 2,000;

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
one is 1,500.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Instead, we find it very easy to think in very relative terms

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
as options change from one time to another.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
So we think of things as, "Oh, I'm going to get more," or "Oh, I'm going to get less."

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
This is all well and good, except that

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
changes in different directions

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
actually effect whether or not we think

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
options are good or not.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
And this leads to the second bias,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
which economists have called loss aversion.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
The idea is that we really hate it when things go into the red.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
We really hate it when we have to lose out on some money.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
And this means that sometimes we'll actually

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
switch our preferences to avoid this.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
What you saw in that last scenario is that

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
subjects get risky

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
because they want the small shot that there won't be any loss.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
That means when we're in a risk mindset --

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
excuse me, when we're in a loss mindset,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
we actually become more risky,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
which can actually be really worrying.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
These kinds of things play out in lots of bad ways in humans.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
They're why stock investors hold onto losing stocks longer --

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
because they're evaluating them in relative terms.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
They're why people in the housing market refused to sell their house --

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
because they don't want to sell at a loss.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
The question we were interested in

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
is whether the monkeys show the same biases.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
If we set up those same scenarios in our little monkey market,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
would they do the same thing as people?

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
And so this is what we did, we gave the monkeys choices

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
between guys who were safe -- they did the same thing every time --

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
or guys who were risky --

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
they did things differently half the time.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
And then we gave them options that were bonuses --

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
like you guys did in the first scenario --

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
so they actually have a chance more,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
or pieces where they were experiencing losses --

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
they actually thought they were going to get more than they really got.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
And so this is what this looks like.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
We introduced the monkeys to two new monkey salesmen.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
The guy on the left and right both start with one piece of grape,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
so it looks pretty good.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
But they're going to give the monkeys bonuses.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
The guy on the left is a safe bonus.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
All the time, he adds one, to give the monkeys two.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
The guy on the right is actually a risky bonus.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Sometimes the monkeys get no bonus -- so this is a bonus of zero.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Sometimes the monkeys get two extra.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
For a big bonus, now they get three.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
But this is the same choice you guys just faced.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
Do the monkeys actually want to play it safe

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
and then go with the guy who's going to do the same thing on every trial,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
or do they want to be risky

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
and try to get a risky, but big, bonus,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
but risk the possibility of getting no bonus.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
People here played it safe.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Turns out, the monkeys play it safe too.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Qualitatively and quantitatively,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
they choose exactly the same way as people,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
when tested in the same thing.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
You might say, well, maybe the monkeys just don't like risk.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Maybe we should see how they do with losses.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
And so we ran a second version of this.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Now, the monkeys meet two guys

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
who aren't giving them bonuses;

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
they're actually giving them less than they expect.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
So they look like they're starting out with a big amount.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
These are three grapes; the monkey's really psyched for this.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
But now they learn these guys are going to give them less than they expect.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
They guy on the left is a safe loss.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Every single time, he's going to take one of these away

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
and give the monkeys just two.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
the guy on the right is the risky loss.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Sometimes he gives no loss, so the monkeys are really psyched,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
but sometimes he actually gives a big loss,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
taking away two to give the monkeys only one.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
And so what do the monkeys do?

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Again, same choice; they can play it safe

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
for always getting two grapes every single time,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
or they can take a risky bet and choose between one and three.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
The remarkable thing to us is that, when you give monkeys this choice,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
they do the same irrational thing that people do.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
They actually become more risky

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
depending on how the experimenters started.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
This is crazy because it suggests that the monkeys too

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
are evaluating things in relative terms

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
and actually treating losses differently than they treat gains.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
So what does all of this mean?

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Well, what we've shown is that, first of all,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
we can actually give the monkeys a financial currency,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
and they do very similar things with it.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
They do some of the smart things we do,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
some of the kind of not so nice things we do,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
like steal it and so on.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
But they also do some of the irrational things we do.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
They systematically get things wrong

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
and in the same ways that we do.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
This is the first take-home message of the Talk,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
which is that if you saw the beginning of this and you thought,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
oh, I'm totally going to go home and hire a capuchin monkey financial adviser.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
They're way cuter than the one at ... you know --

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Don't do that; they're probably going to be just as dumb

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
as the human one you already have.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
So, you know, a little bad -- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
A little bad for monkey investors.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
But of course, you know, the reason you're laughing is bad for humans too.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Because we've answered the question we started out with.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
We wanted to know where these kinds of errors came from.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
And we started with the hope that maybe we can

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
sort of tweak our financial institutions,

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
tweak our technologies to make ourselves better.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
But what we've learn is that these biases might be a deeper part of us than that.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
In fact, they might be due to the very nature

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
of our evolutionary history.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
You know, maybe it's not just humans

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
at the right side of this chain that's duncey.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
Maybe it's sort of duncey all the way back.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
And this, if we believe the capuchin monkey results,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
means that these duncey strategies

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
might be 35 million years old.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
That's a long time for a strategy

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
to potentially get changed around -- really, really old.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
What do we know about other old strategies like this?

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
Well, one thing we know is that they tend to be really hard to overcome.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
You know, think of our evolutionary predilection

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
for eating sweet things, fatty things like cheesecake.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
You can't just shut that off.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
You can't just look at the dessert cart as say, "No, no, no. That looks disgusting to me."

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
We're just built differently.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
We're going to perceive it as a good thing to go after.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
My guess is that the same thing is going to be true

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
when humans are perceiving

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
different financial decisions.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
When you're watching your stocks plummet into the red,

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
when you're watching your house price go down,

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
you're not going to be able to see that

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
in anything but old evolutionary terms.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
This means that the biases

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
that lead investors to do badly,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
that lead to the foreclosure crisis

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
are going to be really hard to overcome.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
So that's the bad news. The question is: is there any good news?

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
I'm supposed to be up here telling you the good news.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Well, the good news, I think,

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
is what I started with at the beginning of the Talk,

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
which is that humans are not only smart;

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
we're really inspirationally smart

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
to the rest of the animals in the biological kingdom.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
We're so good at overcoming our biological limitations --

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
you know, I flew over here in an airplane.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
I didn't have to try to flap my wings.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
I'm wearing contact lenses now so that I can see all of you.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
I don't have to rely on my own near-sightedness.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
We actually have all of these cases

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000
where we overcome our biological limitations

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
through technology and other means, seemingly pretty easily.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
But we have to recognize that we have those limitations.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000
And here's the rub.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
It was Camus who once said that, "Man is the only species

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
who refuses to be what he really is."

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
But the irony is that

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
it might only be in recognizing our limitations

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
that we can really actually overcome them.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
The hope is that you all will think about your limitations,

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
not necessarily as unovercomable,

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
but to recognize them, accept them

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
and then use the world of design to actually figure them out.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.000
That might be the only way that we will really be able

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
to achieve our own human potential

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
and really be the noble species we hope to all be.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
Thank you.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000
(Applause)
