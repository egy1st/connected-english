00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Last year when I was here, I was speaking to you about a swim

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
which I did across the North Pole.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
And while that swim took place three years ago,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I can remember it as if it was yesterday.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I remember standing on the edge of the ice,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
about to dive into the water,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and thinking to myself, I have never ever

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
seen any place on this earth

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
which is just so frightening.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The water is completely black.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The water is minus 1.7 degrees centigrade,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
or 29 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It's flipping freezing in that water.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And then a thought came across my mind:

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
if things go pear-shaped on this swim,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
how long will it take for my frozen body

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
to sink the four and a half kilometers

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
to the bottom of the ocean?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And then I said to myself, I've just got to get this thought

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
out of my mind as quickly as possible.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And the only way I can dive

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
into that freezing cold water

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and swim a kilometer

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
is by listening to my iPod and really revving myself up,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
listening to everything from beautiful opera

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
all the way across to Puff Daddy,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and then committing myself a hundred percent --

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
there is nothing more powerful than the made-up mind --

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and then walking up to the edge of the ice

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and just diving into the water.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And that swim took me

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
18 minutes and 50 seconds,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and it felt like 18 days.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And I remember getting out of the water

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and my hands feeling so painful

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and looking down at my fingers,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and my fingers were literally the size of sausages

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
because -- you know, we're made partially of water --

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
when water freezes it expands,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
and so the cells in my fingers

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
had frozen and expanded

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and burst.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And the most immediate thought when I came out of that water

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
was the following:

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I'm never, ever

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
going to do another cold water swim

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
in my life again.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Anyway, last year, I heard about the Himalayas

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and the melting of the -- (Laughter)

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and the melting of the glaciers

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
because of climate change.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I heard about this lake, Lake Imja.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
This lake has been formed in the last couple of years

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
because of the melting of the glacier.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
The glacier's gone all the way up the mountain

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and left in its place this big lake.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And I firmly believe

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
that what we're seeing in the Himalayas

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
is the next great, big battleground

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
on this earth.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Nearly two billion people --

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
so one in three people on this earth --

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
rely on the water from the Himalayas.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And with a population increasing as quickly as it is,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
and with the water supply from these glaciers --

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
because of climate change --

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
decreasing so much,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
I think we have a real risk of instability.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
North, you've got China; south, you've India, Pakistan, Bangladesh,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
all these countries.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And so I decided

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
to walk up to Mt. Everest,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
the highest mountain on this earth,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and go and do a symbolic swim

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
underneath the summit

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
of Mt. Everest.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Now, I don't know if any of you have had the opportunity to go to Mt. Everest,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
but it's quite an ordeal getting up there.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
28 great, big, powerful yaks

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
carrying all the equipment up onto this mountain --

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I don't just have my Speedo,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
but there's a big film crew who then

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
send all the images around the world.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
The other thing which was so challenging about this swim

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
is not just the altitude.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
I wanted to do the swim at 5,300 meters above sea level.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
So it's right up in the heavens.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
It's very, very difficult to breath. You get altitude sickness.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
I feels like you've got a man standing behind you with a hammer

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
just hitting your head all the time.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
That's not the worst part of it.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
The worst part was this year was the year where they decided

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
to do a big cleanup operation on Mt. Everest.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Many, many people have died on Mt. Everest,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and this was the year they decided to go

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and recover all the bodies of the mountaineers

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
and then bring them down the mountain.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And when you're walking up the mountain

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
to attempt to do something

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
which no human has ever done before, and, in fact, no fish --

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
there are no fish up there swimming at 5,300 meters --

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
When you're trying to do that,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and then the bodies are coming past you,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
it humbles you,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
and you also realize very, very clearly

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
that nature is so much more powerful

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
than we are.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And we walked up this pathway,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
all the way up.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And to the right hand side of us

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
was this great Khumbu Glacier.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
And all the way along the glacier we saw

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
these big pools of melting ice.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
And then we got up to this small lake

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
underneath the summit of Mt. Everest,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and I prepared myself

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
the same way as I've always prepared myself,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
for this swim which was going to be so very difficult.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
I put on my iPod, I listened to some music,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
I got myself as aggressive as possible --

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
but controlled aggression --

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
and then I hurled myself

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
into that water.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
I swam as quickly as I could

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
for the first hundred meters,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
and then I realized very, very quickly,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
I had a huge problem on my hands.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
I could barely breathe.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
I was gasping for air.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
I then began to choke,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
and then it quickly led to me vomiting in the water.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
And it all happened so quickly:

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
I then -- I don't know how it happened -- but I went underwater.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And luckily, the water was quite shallow,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
and I was able to push myself off the bottom of the lake

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
and get up and then take another gasp of air.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And then I said, carry on. Carry on. Carry on.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
I carried on for another five or six strokes,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
and then I had nothing in my body,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
and I went down to the bottom of the lake.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And I don't where I got it from,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
but I was able to somehow

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
pull myself up and as quickly as possible

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
get to the side of the lake.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
I've heard it said that drowning

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
is the most peaceful death that you can have.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
I have never, ever heard

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
such utter bollocks.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
(Laughter)

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
It is the most frightening and panicky feeling

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
that you can have.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
I got myself to the side of the lake.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
My crew grabbed me,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
and then we walked as quickly as we could

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
down -- over the rubble --

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
down to our camp.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
And there, we sat down,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
and we did a debrief about what had gone wrong

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
there on Mt. Everest.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
And my team just gave it to me straight.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
They said, Lewis, you need to have

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
a radical tactical shift

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
if you want to do this swim.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Every single thing which you have learned

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
in the past 23 years of swimming,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
you must forget.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Every single thing which you learned

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
when you were serving in the British army,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
about speed and aggression,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
you put that to one side.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
We want you to walk up the hill in another two days' time.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Take some time to rest and think about things.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
We want you to walk up the mountain in two days' time,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
and instead of swimming fast,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
swim as slowly as possible.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Instead of swimming crawl, swim breaststroke.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
And remember, never ever swim with aggression.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
This is the time to swim

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
with real humility.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
And so we walked back up

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
to the mountain two days later.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
And I stood there

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
on the edge of the lake,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
and I looked up at Mt. Everest --

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
and she is one of the most beautiful mountains on the earth --

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
and I said to myself, just do this slowly.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
And I swam across the lake.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
And I can't begin to tell you

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
how good I felt

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
when I came to the other side.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
But I learned two very, very

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
important lessons there on Mt. Everest,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
and I thank my team of Sherpas who taught me this.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
The first one is

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
that just because something has worked in the past so well,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
doesn't mean it's going to work in the future.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
And similarly,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
now, before I do anything,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
I ask myself what type of mindset

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
do I require

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
to successfully complete a task.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
And taking that into the world of climate change --

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
which is, frankly,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
the Mt. Everest of all problems --

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
just because we've lived the way we have lived for so long,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
just because we have consumed the way we have for so long

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
and populated the earth the way we have for so long,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
doesn't mean that we can carry on

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
the way we are carrying on.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
The warning signs are all there.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
When I was born, the world's population

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
was 3.5 billion people.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
We're now 6.8 billion people,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
and we're expected to be 9 billion people

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
by 2050.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
And then the second lesson,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
the radical, tactical shift.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
And I've come here to ask you today:

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
what radical tactical shift

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
can you take in your relationship to the environment,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
which will ensure

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
that our children and our grandchildren

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
live in a safe world

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
and a secure world,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
and most importantly, in a sustainable world?

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
And I ask you, please, to go away from here

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
and think about that one

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
radical tactical shift

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
which you could make,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
which will make that big difference,

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
and then commit a hundred percent to doing it.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Blog about it, tweet about it, talk about it,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
and commit a hundred percent,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
because very, very few things

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
are impossible to achieve

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
if we really put our whole minds to it.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
So thank you very, very much.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
(Applause)
