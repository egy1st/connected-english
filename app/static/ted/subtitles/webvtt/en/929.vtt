WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I grew up on a small farm in Missouri.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We lived on less than a dollar a day

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
for about 15 years.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I got a scholarship, went to university,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
studied international agriculture, studied anthropology,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and decided I was going to give back.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I was going to work with small farmers.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I was going to help alleviate poverty.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I was going to work on international development,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and then I took a turn

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and ended up here.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Now, if you get a Ph.D., and you decide not to teach,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
you don't always end up in a place like this.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
It's a choice. You might end up driving a taxicab.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
You could be in New York.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
What I found was,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I started working with refugees and famine victims --

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
small farmers, all, or nearly all --

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
who had been dispossessed and displaced.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Now, what I'd been trained to do

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
was methodological research on such people.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So I did it: I found out how many women

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
had been raped en route to these camps.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I found out how many people had been put in jail,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
how many family members had been killed.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
I assessed how long they were going to stay

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and how much it would take to feed them.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And I got really good at predicting

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
how many body bags you would need

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
for the people who were going to die in these camps.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Now this is God's work, but it's not my work.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
It's not the work I set out to do.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
So I was at a Grateful Dead benefit concert on the rainforests

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
in 1988.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I met a guy -- the guy on the left.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
His name was Ben.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
He said, "What can I do to save the rainforests?"

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I said, "Well, Ben, what do you do?"

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
"I make ice cream."

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
So I said, "Well, you've got to make

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
a rainforest ice cream.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And you've got to use nuts from the rainforests

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
to show that forests are worth more as forests

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
than they are as pasture."

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
He said, "Okay."

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Within a year,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Rainforest Crunch was on the shelves.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
It was a great success.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
We did our first million-dollars-worth of trade

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
by buying on 30 days and selling on 21.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
That gets your adrenaline going.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Then we had a four and a half million-dollar line of credit

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
because we were credit-worthy at that point.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
We had 15 to 20, maybe 22 percent

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
of the global Brazil-nut market.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
We paid two to three times more than anybody else.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Everybody else raised their prices to the gatherers of Brazil nuts

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
because we would buy it otherwise.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
A great success.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
50 companies signed up, 200 products came out,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
generated 100 million in sales.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
It failed.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Why did it fail?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Because the people who were gathering Brazil nuts

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
weren't the same people who were cutting the forests.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And the people who made money from Brazil nuts

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
were not the people who made money from cutting the forests.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
We were attacking the wrong driver.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
We needed to be working on beef.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
We needed to be working on lumber.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
We needed to be working on soy --

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
things that we were not focused on.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
So let's go back to Sudan.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I often talk to refugees:

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
"Why was it that the West didn't realize

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
that famines are caused by policies and politics,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
not by weather?"

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
And this farmer said to me, one day,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
something that was very profound.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
He said, "You can't wake a person who's pretending to sleep."

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
(Laughter)

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Okay. Fast forward.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
We live on a planet.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
There's just one of them.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
We've got to wake up to the fact

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
that we don't have any more

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and that this is a finite planet.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
We know the limits of the resources we have.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
We may be able to use them differently.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
We may have some innovative, new ideas.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
But in general, this is what we've got.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
There's no more of it.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
There's a basic equation that we can't get away from.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Population times consumption

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
has got to have some kind of relationship to the planet,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
and right now, it's a simple "not equal."

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Our work shows that we're living

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
at about 1.3 planets.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Since 1990,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
we crossed the line

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
of being in a sustainable relationship to the planet.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Now we're at 1.3.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
If we were farmers, we'd be eating our seed.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
For bankers, we'd be living off the principal, not the interest.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
This is where we stand today.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
A lot of people like to point

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
to some place else as the cause of the problem.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
It's always population growth.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Population growth's important,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
but it's also about how much each person consumes.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
So when the average American

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
consumes 43 times as much

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
as the average African,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
we've got to think that consumption is an issue.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
It's not just about population,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
and it's not just about them; it's about us.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
But it's not just about people;

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
it's about lifestyles.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
There's very good evidence --

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
again, we don't necessarily have

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
a peer-reviewed methodology

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
that's bulletproof yet --

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
but there's very good evidence

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
that the average cat in Europe

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
has a larger environmental footprint in its lifetime

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
than the average African.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
You think that's not an issue going forward?

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
You think that's not a question

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
as to how we should be using the Earth's resources?

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Let's go back and visit our equation.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
In 2000, we had six billion people on the planet.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
They were consuming what they were consuming --

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
let's say one unit of consumption each.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
We have six billion units of consumption.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
By 2050,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
we're going to have nine billion people -- all the scientists agree.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
They're all going to consume twice as much as they currently do --

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
scientists, again, agree --

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
because income is going to grow in developing countries

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
five times what it is today --

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
on global average, about [2.9].

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
So we're going to have 18 billion units of consumption.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Who have you heard talking lately

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
that's said we have to triple production

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
of goods and services?

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
But that's what the math says.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
We're not going to be able to do that.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
We can get productivity up.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
We can get efficiency up.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
But we've also got to get consumption down.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
We need to use less

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
to make more.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
And then we need to use less again.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And then we need to consume less.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
All of those things are part of that equation.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
But it basically raises a fundamental question:

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
should consumers have a choice

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
about sustainability, about sustainable products?

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Should you be able to buy a product that's sustainable

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
sitting next to one that isn't,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
or should all the products on the shelf be sustainable?

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
If they should all be sustainable on a finite planet,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
how do you make that happen?

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
The average consumer takes 1.8 seconds in the U.S.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Okay, so let's be generous.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Let's say it's 3.5 seconds in Europe.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
How do you evaluate all the scientific data

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
around a product,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
the data that's changing on a weekly, if not a daily, basis?

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
How do you get informed?

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
You don't.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Here's a little question.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
From a greenhouse gas perspective,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
is lamb produced in the U.K.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
better than lamb produced in New Zealand,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
frozen and shipped to the U.K.?

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Is a bad feeder lot operation for beef

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
better or worse than

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
a bad grazing operation for beef?

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Do organic potatoes

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
actually have fewer toxic chemicals

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
used to produce them

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
than conventional potatoes?

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
In every single case,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
the answer is "it depends."

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
It depends on who produced it and how,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
in every single instance.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
And there are many others.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
How is a consumer going to walk through this minefield?

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
They're not.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
They may have a lot of opinions about it,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
but they're not going to be terribly informed.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Sustainability has got to be a pre-competitive issue.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
It's got to be something we all care about.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
And we need collusion.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
We need groups to work together that never have.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
We need Cargill to work with Bunge.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
We need Coke to work with Pepsi.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
We need Oxford to work with Cambridge.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
We need Greenpeace to work with WWF.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Everybody's got to work together --

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
China and the U.S.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
We need to begin to manage this planet

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
as if our life depended on it,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
because it does,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
it fundamentally does.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
But we can't do everything.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Even if we get everybody working on it,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
we've got to be strategic.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
We need to focus on the where,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
the what and the who.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
So, the where:

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
We've identified 35 places globally that we need to work.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
These are the places that are the richest in biodiversity

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
and the most important from an ecosystem function point-of-view.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
We have to work in these places.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
We have to save these places if we want a chance in hell

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
of preserving biodiversity as we know it.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
We looked at the threats to these places.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
These are the 15 commodities

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
that fundamentally pose the biggest threats

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
to these places

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
because of deforestation,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
soil loss, water use, pesticide use,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
over-fishing, etc.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
So we've got 35 places,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
we've got 15 priority commodities,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
who do we work with

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
to change the way those commodities are produced?

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Are we going to work with 6.9 billion consumers?

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Let's see, that's about 7,000 languages,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
350 major languages --

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
a lot of work there.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
I don't see anybody actually being able

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
to do that very effectively.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Are we going to work with 1.5 billion producers?

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Again, a daunting task.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
There must be a better way.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
300 to 500 companies

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
control 70 percent or more

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
of the trade of each of the 15 commodities

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
that we've identified as the most significant.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
If we work with those, if we change those companies

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
and the way they do business,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
then the rest will happen automatically.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
So, we went through our 15 commodities.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
This is nine of them.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
We lined them up side-by-side,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
and we put the names of the companies that work

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
on each of those.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
And if you go through the first 25 or 30 names

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
of each of the commodities,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
what you begin to see is,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
gosh, there's Cargill here, there's Cargill there,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
there's Cargill everywhere.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
In fact, these names start coming up over and over again.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
So we did the analysis again a slightly different way.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
We said: if we take the top hundred companies,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
what percentage

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
of all 15 commodities

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
do they touch, buy or sell?

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
And what we found is it's 25 percent.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
So 100 companies

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
control 25 percent of the trade

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
of all 15 of the most significant

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
commodities on the planet.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
We can get our arms around a hundred companies.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
A hundred companies, we can work with.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Why is 25 percent important?

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Because if these companies demand sustainable products,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
they'll pull 40 to 50 percent of production.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Companies can push producers

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
faster than consumers can.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
By companies asking for this,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
we can leverage production so much faster

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
than by waiting for consumers to do it.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
After 40 years, the global organic movement

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
has achieved 0.7 of one percent

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
of global food.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
We can't wait that long.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
We don't have that kind of time.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
We need change

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
that's going to accelerate.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Even working with individual companies

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
is not probably going to get us there.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
We need to begin to work with industries.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
So we've started roundtables

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
where we bring together the entire value chain,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
from producers

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
all the way to the retailers and brands.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
We bring in civil society, we bring in NGOs,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
we bring in researchers and scientists

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
to have an informed discussion --

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
sometimes a battle royale --

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
to figure out what are the key impacts

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
of these products,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000
what is a global benchmark,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
what's an acceptable impact,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
and design standards around that.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
It's not all fun and games.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
In salmon aquaculture,

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
we kicked off a roundtable

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
almost six years ago.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Eight entities came to the table.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
We eventually got, I think, 60 percent

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
of global production at the table

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
and 25 percent of demand at the table.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Three of the original eight entities were suing each other.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
And yet, next week, we launch

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
globally verified, vetted and certified

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
standards for salmon aquaculture.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
It can happen.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:18.000
(Applause)

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
So what brings

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
the different entities to the table?

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
It's risk and demand.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
For the big companies, it's reputational risk,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
but more importantly,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
they don't care what the price of commodities is.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
If they don't have commodities, they don't have a business.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
They care about availability,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
so the big risk for them is not having product at all.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
For the producers,

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
if a buyer wants to buy something produced a certain way,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
that's what brings them to the table.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
So it's the demand that brings them to the table.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
The good news is

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
we identified a hundred companies two years ago.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
In the last 18 months, we've signed agreements

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
with 40 of those hundred companies

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
to begin to work with them on their supply chain.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
And in the next 18 months,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
we will have signed up to work with another 40,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
and we think we'll get those signed as well.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Now what we're doing is bringing the CEOs

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
of these 80 companies together

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
to help twist the arms of the final 20,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
to bring them to the table,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
because they don't like NGOs, they've never worked with NGOs,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
they're concerned about this, they're concerned about that,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
but we all need to be in this together.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
So we're pulling out all the stops.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
We're using whatever leverage we have to bring them to the table.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
One company we're working with that's begun --

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
in baby steps, perhaps --

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
but has begun this journey on sustainability is Cargill.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
They've funded research that shows

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
that we can double global palm oil production

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
without cutting a single tree in the next 20 years,

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
and do it all in Borneo alone

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
by planting on land that's already degraded.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
The study shows that the highest net present value

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
for palm oil

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
is on land that's been degraded.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
They're also undertaking a study to look at

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
all of their supplies of palm oil

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
to see if they could be certified

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
and what they would need to change in order to become third-party certified

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
under a credible certification program.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Why is Cargill important?

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Because Cargill has 20 to 25 percent

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
of global palm oil.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
If Cargill makes a decision,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
the entire palm oil industry moves,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
or at least 40 or 50 percent of it.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
That's not insignificant.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
More importantly, Cargill and one other company

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
ship 50 percent of the palm oil

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
that goes to China.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
We don't have to change the way

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
a single Chinese company works

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
if we get Cargill to only send

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
sustainable palm oil to China.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
It's a pre-competitive issue.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
All the palm oil going there is good.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Buy it.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
Mars is also on a similar journey.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Now most people understand that Mars is a chocolate company,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
but Mars has made sustainability pledges

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
to buy only certified product for all of its seafood.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
It turns out Mars buys more seafood than Walmart

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
because of pet food.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
But they're doing some really interesting things around chocolate,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
and it all comes from the fact

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
that Mars wants to be in business in the future.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
And what they see is that they need to

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
improve chocolate production.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
On any given plantation,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
20 percent of the trees produce 80 percent of the crop,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
so Mars is looking at the genome,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
they're sequencing the genome of the cocoa plant.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
They're doing it with IBM and the USDA,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
and they're putting it in the public domain

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
because they want everybody to have access to this data,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
because they want everybody to help them

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
make cocoa more productive and more sustainable.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
What they've realized

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
is that if they can identify the traits

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
on productivity and drought tolerance,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
they can produce 320 percent as much cocoa

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
on 40 percent of the land.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
The rest of the land can be used for something else.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
It's more with less and less again.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
That's what the future has got to be,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
and putting it in the public domain is smart.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
They don't want to be an I.P. company; they want to be a chocolate company,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
but they want to be a chocolate company forever.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
Now, the price of food, many people complain about,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
but in fact, the price of food is going down,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
and that's odd because in fact,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
consumers are not paying for the true cost of food.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
If you take a look just at water,

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
what we see is that,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
with four very common products,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
you look at how much a farmer produced to make those products,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
and then you look at how much water input was put into them,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
and then you look at what the farmer was paid.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
If you divide the amount of water

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
into what the farmer was paid,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
the farmer didn't receive enough money

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
to pay a decent price for water in any of those commodities.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
That is an externality by definition.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
This is the subsidy from nature.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Coca-Cola, they've worked a lot on water,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
but right now, they're entering into 17-year contracts

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
with growers in Turkey

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
to sell juice into Europe,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
and they're doing that because they want to have a product

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
that's closer to the European market.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
But they're not just buying the juice;

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
they're also buying the carbon in the trees

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
to offset the shipment costs associated with carbon

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
to get the product into Europe.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
There's carbon that's being bought with sugar,

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
with coffee, with beef.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
This is called bundling. It's bringing those externalities

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
back into the price of the commodity.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
We need to take what we've learned in private, voluntary standards

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
of what the best producers in the world are doing

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
and use that to inform government regulation,

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
so we can shift the entire performance curve.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
We can't just focus on identifying the best;

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
we've got to move the rest.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
The issue isn't what to think, it's how to think.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
These companies have begun to think differently.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
They're on a journey; there's no turning back.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
We're all on that same journey with them.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
We have to really begin to change

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
the way we think about everything.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
Whatever was sustainable on a planet of six billion

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
is not going to be sustainable on a planet with nine.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
Thank you.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
(Applause)
