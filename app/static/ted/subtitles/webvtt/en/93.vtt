00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.404
I'm going to talk to you about some stuff
that's in this book of mine

00:00:03.428 --> 00:00:06.546
that I hope will resonate with
other things you've already heard,

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.784
and I'll try to make
some connections myself,

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:10.454
in case you miss them.

00:00:10.478 --> 00:00:14.563
But I want to start with
what I call the "official dogma."

00:00:14.983 --> 00:00:16.447
The official dogma of what?

00:00:16.471 --> 00:00:19.819
The official dogma of all Western
industrial societies.

00:00:19.843 --> 00:00:22.122
And the official dogma runs like this:

00:00:22.146 --> 00:00:26.815
if we are interested in maximizing
the welfare of our citizens,

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:31.814
the way to do that
is to maximize individual freedom.

00:00:32.965 --> 00:00:37.135
The reason for this is both
that freedom is, in and of itself, good,

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:40.573
valuable, worthwhile,
essential to being human,

00:00:40.597 --> 00:00:42.976
and because if people have freedom,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.363
then each of us can act on our own

00:00:45.387 --> 00:00:47.681
to do the things
that will maximize our welfare,

00:00:47.705 --> 00:00:49.803
and no one has to decide on our behalf.

00:00:50.771 --> 00:00:54.859
The way to maximize freedom
is to maximize choice.

00:00:55.738 --> 00:00:59.594
The more choice people have,
the more freedom they have,

00:00:59.618 --> 00:01:01.221
and the more freedom they have,

00:01:01.245 --> 00:01:02.786
the more welfare they have.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.507
This, I think, is so deeply embedded
in the water supply

00:01:09.531 --> 00:01:12.546
that it wouldn't occur
to anyone to question it.

00:01:13.379 --> 00:01:17.282
And it's also deeply
embedded in our lives.

00:01:17.711 --> 00:01:19.409
I'll give you some examples

00:01:19.433 --> 00:01:22.976
of what modern progress
has made possible for us.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.353
This is my supermarket.

00:01:24.854 --> 00:01:26.121
Not such a big one.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.239
I want to say just a word
about salad dressing.

00:01:29.263 --> 00:01:31.976
A hundred seventy-five
salad dressings in my supermarket,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.087
if you don't count
the 10 extra-virgin olive oils

00:01:35.111 --> 00:01:38.093
and 12 balsamic vinegars you could buy

00:01:38.117 --> 00:01:40.976
to make a very large number
of your own salad dressings,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.971
in the off-chance that none of the 175
the store has on offer suit you.

00:01:46.511 --> 00:01:48.470
So this is what the supermarket is like.

00:01:48.494 --> 00:01:50.865
And then you go
to the consumer electronics store

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:52.273
to set up a stereo system --

00:01:52.297 --> 00:01:55.976
speakers, CD player,
tape player, tuner, amplifier --

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.976
and in this one single
consumer electronics store,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.418
there are that many stereo systems.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.969
We can construct six and a half million
different stereo systems

00:02:08.993 --> 00:02:11.579
out of the components
that are on offer in one store.

00:02:11.603 --> 00:02:13.617
You've got to admit
that's a lot of choice.

00:02:14.294 --> 00:02:18.024
In other domains --
the world of communications.

00:02:18.389 --> 00:02:20.231
There was a time, when I was a boy,

00:02:20.255 --> 00:02:23.072
when you could get any kind
of telephone service you wanted,

00:02:23.096 --> 00:02:24.914
as long as it came from Ma Bell.

00:02:24.938 --> 00:02:27.112
You rented your phone, you didn't buy it.

00:02:27.136 --> 00:02:30.589
One consequence of that, by the way,
is that the phone never broke.

00:02:30.613 --> 00:02:32.976
And those days are gone.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.976
We now have an almost unlimited
variety of phones,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.277
especially in the world of cell phones.

00:02:38.301 --> 00:02:40.344
These are cell phones of the future.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.153
My favorite is the middle one --

00:02:43.177 --> 00:02:46.809
the MP3 player, nose hair trimmer,
and crème brûlée torch.

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:47.983
And if --

00:02:48.007 --> 00:02:49.696
(Laughter)

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.824
if by some chance you haven't seen
that in your store yet,

00:02:52.848 --> 00:02:55.947
you can rest assured
that one day soon, you will.

00:02:55.971 --> 00:02:59.024
And what this does is it leads people
to walk into their stores,

00:02:59.048 --> 00:03:00.294
asking this question.

00:03:00.785 --> 00:03:03.453
And do you know what the answer
to this question now is?

00:03:03.477 --> 00:03:05.054
The answer is "no."

00:03:05.483 --> 00:03:08.630
It is not possible to buy a cell phone
that doesn't do too much.

00:03:08.654 --> 00:03:14.166
So, in other aspects of life that are much
more significant than buying things,

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.493
the same explosion of choice is true.

00:03:17.517 --> 00:03:19.119
Health care.

00:03:19.143 --> 00:03:21.580
It is no longer the case
in the United States

00:03:21.604 --> 00:03:25.456
that you go to the doctor,
and the doctor tells you what to do.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.003
Instead, you go to the doctor,

00:03:27.027 --> 00:03:30.313
and the doctor tells you,
"Well, we could do A, or we could do B.

00:03:30.337 --> 00:03:32.719
A has these benefits and these risks.

00:03:32.743 --> 00:03:35.066
B has these benefits and these risks.

00:03:35.454 --> 00:03:36.780
What do you want to do?"

00:03:37.138 --> 00:03:39.352
And you say, "Doc, what should I do?"

00:03:39.967 --> 00:03:42.957
And the doc says, "A has
these benefits and risks,

00:03:42.981 --> 00:03:44.817
and B has these benefits and risks.

00:03:44.841 --> 00:03:46.380
What do you want to do?"

00:03:46.777 --> 00:03:50.344
And you say, "If you were me,
Doc, what would you do?"

00:03:50.793 --> 00:03:52.957
And the doc says, "But I'm not you."

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:56.674
And the result is --
we call it "patient autonomy,"

00:03:56.698 --> 00:03:58.683
which makes it sound like a good thing,

00:03:58.707 --> 00:04:02.109
but what it really is is a shifting
of the burden and the responsibility

00:04:02.133 --> 00:04:03.294
for decision-making

00:04:03.318 --> 00:04:06.060
from somebody who knows something --
namely, the doctor --

00:04:06.084 --> 00:04:08.862
to somebody who knows nothing
and is almost certainly sick

00:04:08.886 --> 00:04:11.634
and thus, not in the best shape
to be making decisions --

00:04:11.658 --> 00:04:12.872
namely, the patient.

00:04:12.896 --> 00:04:15.722
There's enormous marketing
of prescription drugs

00:04:15.746 --> 00:04:17.149
to people like you and me,

00:04:17.173 --> 00:04:19.626
which, if you think about it,
makes no sense at all,

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:20.826
since we can't buy them.

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.191
Why do they market to us
if we can't buy them?

00:04:23.215 --> 00:04:27.213
The answer is that they expect us
to call our doctors the next morning

00:04:27.237 --> 00:04:29.356
and ask for our prescriptions
to be changed.

00:04:30.532 --> 00:04:34.509
Something as dramatic as our identity

00:04:34.533 --> 00:04:37.395
has now become a matter of choice,

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:40.770
as this slide is meant to indicate.

00:04:40.794 --> 00:04:43.719
We don't inherit an identity;
we get to invent it.

00:04:43.743 --> 00:04:47.038
And we get to reinvent ourselves
as often as we like.

00:04:47.062 --> 00:04:50.103
And that means that every day,
when you wake up in the morning,

00:04:50.127 --> 00:04:53.062
you have to decide
what kind of person you want to be.

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.711
With respect to marriage and family:

00:04:57.497 --> 00:05:02.455
there was a time when the default
assumption that almost everyone had

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:04.625
is that you got married
as soon as you could,

00:05:04.649 --> 00:05:07.472
and then you started having kids
as soon as you could.

00:05:07.496 --> 00:05:09.904
The only real choice was who,

00:05:09.928 --> 00:05:12.541
not when, and not what you did after.

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:15.976
Nowadays, everything
is very much up for grabs.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.721
I teach wonderfully intelligent students,

00:05:18.745 --> 00:05:22.665
and I assign 20 percent
less work than I used to.

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:25.137
And it's not because they're less smart,

00:05:25.161 --> 00:05:27.466
and it's not because
they're less diligent.

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.870
It's because they are preoccupied,
asking themselves,

00:05:30.894 --> 00:05:33.601
"Should I get married or not?
Should I get married now?

00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:34.941
Should I get married later?

00:05:34.965 --> 00:05:37.319
Should I have kids first
or a career first?"

00:05:37.343 --> 00:05:40.072
All of these are consuming questions.

00:05:40.096 --> 00:05:42.214
And they're going to answer
these questions,

00:05:42.238 --> 00:05:44.830
whether or not it means
not doing all the work I assign

00:05:44.854 --> 00:05:46.880
and not getting a good grade
in my courses.

00:05:46.904 --> 00:05:48.057
And indeed they should.

00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:50.549
These are important questions to answer.

00:05:51.887 --> 00:05:53.319
Work.

00:05:53.343 --> 00:05:55.581
We are blessed, as Carl was pointing out,

00:05:55.605 --> 00:06:01.427
with the technology that enables us
to work every minute of every day

00:06:01.451 --> 00:06:03.491
from any place on the planet --

00:06:03.515 --> 00:06:05.415
except the Randolph Hotel.

00:06:05.777 --> 00:06:08.817
(Laughter)

00:06:08.841 --> 00:06:10.729
(Applause)

00:06:10.753 --> 00:06:12.976
There is one corner, by the way,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.606
that I'm not going to tell anybody about,
where the WiFi actually works.

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.504
I'm not telling you about it,
because I want to use it.

00:06:20.528 --> 00:06:21.684
So what this means,

00:06:21.708 --> 00:06:24.802
this incredible freedom of choice
we have with respect to work,

00:06:24.826 --> 00:06:26.673
is that we have to make a decision,

00:06:26.697 --> 00:06:28.556
again and again and again,

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.193
about whether we should
or shouldn't be working.

00:06:31.217 --> 00:06:33.605
We can go to watch our kid play soccer,

00:06:33.629 --> 00:06:37.559
and we have our cell phone on one hip
and our Blackberry on our other hip,

00:06:37.583 --> 00:06:40.478
and our laptop, presumably, on our laps.

00:06:40.502 --> 00:06:42.547
And even if they're all shut off,

00:06:42.571 --> 00:06:45.813
every minute that we're watching
our kid mutilate a soccer game,

00:06:45.837 --> 00:06:47.448
we are also asking ourselves,

00:06:47.472 --> 00:06:49.706
"Should I answer this cell phone call?

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:52.567
Should I respond to this email?
Should I draft this letter?"

00:06:52.591 --> 00:06:55.167
And even if the answer
to the question is "no,"

00:06:55.191 --> 00:06:58.483
it's certainly going to make
the experience of your kid's soccer game

00:06:58.507 --> 00:07:00.642
very different than it would've been.

00:07:00.666 --> 00:07:02.707
So everywhere we look,

00:07:02.731 --> 00:07:06.489
big things and small things,
material things and lifestyle things,

00:07:06.513 --> 00:07:08.741
life is a matter of choice.

00:07:09.503 --> 00:07:13.062
And the world we used
to live in looked like this.

00:07:13.086 --> 00:07:15.211
[Well, actually,
they are written in stone.]

00:07:15.235 --> 00:07:17.177
That is to say, there were some choices,

00:07:17.201 --> 00:07:19.263
but not everything was a matter of choice.

00:07:19.287 --> 00:07:21.367
The world we now live in looks like this.

00:07:21.391 --> 00:07:23.434
[The Ten Commandments Do-It-Yourself Kit]

00:07:23.458 --> 00:07:26.883
And the question is:
Is this good news or bad news?

00:07:28.047 --> 00:07:30.409
And the answer is "yes."

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.611
(Laughter)

00:07:33.357 --> 00:07:35.619
We all know what's good about it,

00:07:35.643 --> 00:07:38.278
so I'm going to talk
about what's bad about it.

00:07:38.302 --> 00:07:41.447
All of this choice has two effects,

00:07:41.471 --> 00:07:43.420
two negative effects on people.

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.715
One effect, paradoxically,

00:07:46.739 --> 00:07:50.242
is that it produces paralysis
rather than liberation.

00:07:50.698 --> 00:07:53.084
With so many options to choose from,

00:07:53.108 --> 00:07:56.736
people find it very difficult
to choose at all.

00:07:57.293 --> 00:07:59.976
I'll give you one very dramatic
example of this,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.682
a study that was done of investments
in voluntary retirement plans.

00:08:06.109 --> 00:08:11.540
A colleague of mine got access
to investment records from Vanguard,

00:08:11.564 --> 00:08:13.288
the gigantic mutual fund company,

00:08:13.312 --> 00:08:16.976
of about a million employees
and about 2,000 different workplaces.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.755
What she found is that for every
10 mutual funds the employer offered,

00:08:22.779 --> 00:08:26.537
rate of participation
went down two percent.

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:31.656
You offer 50 funds -- 10 percent
fewer employees participate

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.337
than if you only offer five.

00:08:34.014 --> 00:08:35.173
Why?

00:08:35.197 --> 00:08:37.181
Because with 50 funds to choose from,

00:08:37.205 --> 00:08:40.976
it's so damn hard to decide
which fund to choose,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.048
that you'll just put it off till tomorrow,

00:08:43.072 --> 00:08:44.271
and then tomorrow

00:08:44.295 --> 00:08:46.774
and then tomorrow and tomorrow,

00:08:46.798 --> 00:08:48.628
and, of course, tomorrow never comes.

00:08:48.652 --> 00:08:50.664
Understand that not only does this mean

00:08:50.688 --> 00:08:53.647
that people are going to have
to eat dog food when they retire

00:08:53.671 --> 00:08:55.844
because they don't have
enough money put away,

00:08:55.868 --> 00:08:58.378
it also means that making
the decision is so hard

00:08:58.402 --> 00:09:02.058
that they pass up significant
matching money from the employer.

00:09:02.082 --> 00:09:06.320
By not participating, they are passing up
as much as 5,000 dollars a year

00:09:06.344 --> 00:09:07.503
from the employer,

00:09:07.527 --> 00:09:09.659
who would happily
match their contribution.

00:09:10.087 --> 00:09:13.774
So paralysis is a consequence
of having too many choices.

00:09:13.798 --> 00:09:16.471
And I think it makes
the world look like this.

00:09:16.871 --> 00:09:20.696
[And lastly, for all eternity,
French, bleu cheese or ranch?]

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.976
(Laughter)

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.012
You really want to get the decision right
if it's for all eternity, right?

00:09:27.036 --> 00:09:30.440
You don't want to pick the wrong
mutual fund or wrong salad dressing.

00:09:30.464 --> 00:09:31.616
So that's one effect.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:36.301
The second effect is that, even if
we manage to overcome the paralysis

00:09:36.325 --> 00:09:38.356
and make a choice,

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:42.348
we end up less satisfied
with the result of the choice

00:09:42.372 --> 00:09:45.172
than we would be if we had
fewer options to choose from.

00:09:45.769 --> 00:09:47.647
And there are several reasons for this.

00:09:48.359 --> 00:09:52.108
One of them is, with a lot of different
salad dressings to choose from,

00:09:52.132 --> 00:09:55.666
if you buy one and it's not perfect --
and what salad dressing is? --

00:09:55.690 --> 00:09:58.811
it's easy to imagine
that you could've made a different choice

00:09:58.835 --> 00:10:00.331
that would've been better.

00:10:00.864 --> 00:10:02.137
And what happens is,

00:10:02.161 --> 00:10:07.139
this imagined alternative induces you
to regret the decision you made,

00:10:07.163 --> 00:10:10.052
and this regret subtracts
from the satisfaction you get

00:10:10.076 --> 00:10:11.481
out of the decision you made,

00:10:11.505 --> 00:10:13.152
even if it was a good decision.

00:10:13.626 --> 00:10:17.334
The more options there are,
the easier it is to regret anything at all

00:10:17.358 --> 00:10:19.882
that is disappointing
about the option that you chose.

00:10:20.342 --> 00:10:23.351
Second, what economists
call "opportunity costs."

00:10:23.375 --> 00:10:25.384
Dan Gilbert made a big point this morning

00:10:25.408 --> 00:10:30.071
of talking about how much the way
in which we value things

00:10:30.095 --> 00:10:32.367
depends on what we compare them to.

00:10:32.391 --> 00:10:35.976
Well, when there are lots
of alternatives to consider,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:41.976
it's easy to imagine the attractive
features of alternatives that you reject

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.668
that make you less satisfied
with the alternative that you've chosen.

00:10:46.692 --> 00:10:47.843
Here's an example.

00:10:47.867 --> 00:10:51.841
[I can't stop thinking about those other
available parking spaces on W 85th Street]

00:10:51.865 --> 00:10:53.781
If you're not a New Yorker, I apologize.

00:10:53.805 --> 00:10:55.835
Here's what you're supposed
to be thinking.

00:10:55.859 --> 00:10:58.857
Here's this couple on the Hamptons.
Very expensive real estate.

00:10:58.881 --> 00:11:01.837
Gorgeous beach. Beautiful day.
They have it all to themselves.

00:11:01.861 --> 00:11:03.053
What could be better?

00:11:03.077 --> 00:11:04.655
"Damn it," this guy is thinking,

00:11:04.679 --> 00:11:08.670
"It's August. Everybody
in my Manhattan neighborhood is away.

00:11:08.694 --> 00:11:11.724
I could be parking
right in front of my building."

00:11:12.851 --> 00:11:16.515
And he spends two weeks nagged by the idea

00:11:16.539 --> 00:11:19.620
that he is missing
the opportunity, day after day,

00:11:19.644 --> 00:11:21.362
to have a great parking space.

00:11:21.386 --> 00:11:23.099
(Laughter)

00:11:23.123 --> 00:11:26.109
Opportunity costs
subtract from the satisfaction

00:11:26.133 --> 00:11:27.774
that we get out of what we choose,

00:11:27.798 --> 00:11:29.631
even when what we choose is terrific.

00:11:30.178 --> 00:11:32.529
And the more options
there are to consider,

00:11:32.553 --> 00:11:34.699
the more attractive features
of these options

00:11:34.723 --> 00:11:37.737
are going to be reflected by us
as opportunity costs.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:39.499
Here's another example.

00:11:40.721 --> 00:11:43.865
(Laughter)

00:11:43.889 --> 00:11:46.574
Now, this cartoon makes a lot of points.

00:11:46.598 --> 00:11:49.731
It makes points about
living in the moment as well,

00:11:49.755 --> 00:11:51.807
and probably about doing things slowly.

00:11:51.831 --> 00:11:54.942
But one point it makes is that whenever
you're choosing one thing,

00:11:54.966 --> 00:11:56.839
you're choosing not to do other things,

00:11:56.863 --> 00:11:59.696
and those other things may have
lots of attractive features,

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.646
and it's going to make what you're doing

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:02.821
less attractive.

00:12:02.845 --> 00:12:04.603
Third: escalation of expectations.

00:12:04.627 --> 00:12:07.380
This hit me when I went
to replace my jeans.

00:12:07.404 --> 00:12:09.507
I wear jeans almost all the time.

00:12:09.531 --> 00:12:12.021
There was a time
when jeans came in one flavor,

00:12:12.045 --> 00:12:14.114
and you bought them,
and they fit like crap.

00:12:14.138 --> 00:12:15.816
They were incredibly uncomfortable,

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.769
and if you wore them long enough
and washed them enough times,

00:12:18.793 --> 00:12:20.108
they started to feel OK.

00:12:20.132 --> 00:12:23.222
I went to replace my jeans
after years of wearing these old ones.

00:12:23.246 --> 00:12:26.444
I said, "I want a pair of jeans.
Here's my size."

00:12:26.468 --> 00:12:27.705
And the shopkeeper said,

00:12:27.729 --> 00:12:30.126
"Do you want slim fit,
easy fit, relaxed fit?

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:33.512
You want button fly or zipper fly?
You want stonewashed or acid-washed?

00:12:33.536 --> 00:12:34.919
Do you want them distressed?

00:12:34.943 --> 00:12:38.178
Do you want boot cut, tapered?"
Blah, blah, blah on and on he went.

00:12:38.202 --> 00:12:39.704
My jaw dropped.

00:12:39.728 --> 00:12:41.255
And after I recovered, I said,

00:12:41.279 --> 00:12:44.405
"I want the kind that used to be
the only kind."

00:12:44.429 --> 00:12:49.121
(Laughter)

00:12:49.145 --> 00:12:50.977
He had no idea what that was.

00:12:51.001 --> 00:12:52.158
(Laughter)

00:12:52.182 --> 00:12:55.006
So I spent an hour trying on
all these damn jeans,

00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:57.125
and I walked out of the store -- truth --

00:12:57.149 --> 00:12:59.857
with the best-fitting jeans
I had ever had.

00:12:59.881 --> 00:13:01.056
I did better.

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:04.439
All this choice made it possible
for me to do better.

00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:06.060
But --

00:13:06.084 --> 00:13:07.504
I felt worse.

00:13:08.544 --> 00:13:12.317
Why? I wrote a whole book
to try to explain this to myself.

00:13:12.341 --> 00:13:13.500
The reason is --

00:13:13.524 --> 00:13:17.721
(Laughter)

00:13:17.745 --> 00:13:22.759
The reason I felt worse is that
with all of these options available,

00:13:22.783 --> 00:13:28.171
my expectations about how good
a pair of jeans should be went up.

00:13:29.092 --> 00:13:33.546
I had very low, no particular expectations
when they only came in one flavor.

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:37.168
When they came in 100 flavors, damn it,
one of them should've been perfect.

00:13:37.192 --> 00:13:39.402
And what I got was good,
but it wasn't perfect.

00:13:39.426 --> 00:13:42.715
And so I compared what I got
to what I expected,

00:13:42.739 --> 00:13:46.174
and what I got was disappointing
in comparison to what I expected.

00:13:46.198 --> 00:13:48.238
Adding options to people's lives

00:13:48.262 --> 00:13:51.866
can't help but increase
the expectations people have

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:54.087
about how good those options will be.

00:13:54.111 --> 00:13:57.563
And what that's going to produce
is less satisfaction with results,

00:13:57.587 --> 00:13:59.224
even when they're good results.

00:13:59.248 --> 00:14:01.933
[It all looks so great.
I can't wait to be disappointed.]

00:14:01.957 --> 00:14:04.119
Nobody in the world
of marketing knows this.

00:14:04.143 --> 00:14:08.327
Because if they did, you wouldn't all know
what this was about.

00:14:08.959 --> 00:14:10.863
The truth is more like this.

00:14:11.521 --> 00:14:14.590
[Everything was better back
when everything was worse.]

00:14:14.614 --> 00:14:18.626
The reason that everything was better
back when everything was worse

00:14:18.650 --> 00:14:20.792
is that when everything was worse,

00:14:20.816 --> 00:14:22.587
it was actually possible for people

00:14:22.611 --> 00:14:25.165
to have experiences
that were a pleasant surprise.

00:14:25.999 --> 00:14:30.511
Nowadays, the world we live in --
we affluent, industrialized citizens,

00:14:30.535 --> 00:14:32.512
with perfection the expectation --

00:14:32.536 --> 00:14:34.041
the best you can ever hope for

00:14:34.065 --> 00:14:36.730
is that stuff is as good
as you expect it to be.

00:14:36.754 --> 00:14:38.674
You will never be pleasantly surprised,

00:14:38.698 --> 00:14:40.745
because your expectations,
my expectations,

00:14:40.769 --> 00:14:42.103
have gone through the roof.

00:14:42.127 --> 00:14:45.484
The secret to happiness --
this is what you all came for --

00:14:45.508 --> 00:14:48.057
the secret to happiness is:

00:14:48.081 --> 00:14:50.143
low expectations.

00:14:50.167 --> 00:14:53.412
(Laughter)

00:14:53.436 --> 00:14:54.826
[You'll do]

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:56.326
(Applause)

00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:57.832
(Laughter)

00:14:59.483 --> 00:15:00.673
I want to say --

00:15:00.697 --> 00:15:03.284
just a little autobiographical moment --

00:15:03.308 --> 00:15:06.298
that I actually am married to a wife,

00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:08.273
and she's really quite wonderful.

00:15:08.297 --> 00:15:09.640
I couldn't have done better.

00:15:09.664 --> 00:15:11.229
I didn't settle.

00:15:11.253 --> 00:15:13.728
But settling isn't always
such a bad thing.

00:15:14.158 --> 00:15:15.308
Finally,

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:19.397
one consequence of buying
a bad-fitting pair of jeans

00:15:19.421 --> 00:15:21.607
when there is only one kind to buy

00:15:21.631 --> 00:15:25.352
is that when you are dissatisfied
and you ask why, who's responsible,

00:15:25.376 --> 00:15:27.769
the answer is clear:
the world is responsible.

00:15:27.793 --> 00:15:29.512
What could you do?

00:15:29.536 --> 00:15:32.534
When there are hundreds
of different styles of jeans available

00:15:32.558 --> 00:15:34.774
and you buy one that is disappointing

00:15:34.798 --> 00:15:37.311
and you ask why, who's responsible,

00:15:37.335 --> 00:15:41.581
it is equally clear that the answer
to the question is "you."

00:15:42.264 --> 00:15:43.766
You could have done better.

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:46.976
With a hundred different kinds
of jeans on display,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.177
there is no excuse for failure.

00:15:49.201 --> 00:15:51.653
And so when people make decisions,

00:15:51.677 --> 00:15:54.304
and even though the results
of the decisions are good,

00:15:54.328 --> 00:15:56.726
they feel disappointed about them;

00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:58.727
they blame themselves.

00:15:58.751 --> 00:16:01.796
Clinical depression has exploded
in the industrial world

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:03.217
in the last generation.

00:16:03.241 --> 00:16:06.976
I believe a significant -- not the only,
but a significant -- contributor

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.440
to this explosion of depression
and also suicide,

00:16:10.464 --> 00:16:13.041
is that people have experiences
that are disappointing

00:16:13.065 --> 00:16:14.803
because their standards are so high,

00:16:14.827 --> 00:16:18.016
and then when they have to explain
these experiences to themselves,

00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:19.440
they think they're at fault.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.626
So the net result is that we do
better in general, objectively,

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:26.308
and we feel worse.

00:16:26.935 --> 00:16:29.702
So let me remind you:

00:16:29.726 --> 00:16:34.340
this is the official dogma,
the one that we all take to be true,

00:16:34.364 --> 00:16:36.329
and it's all false.

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:37.919
It is not true.

00:16:38.292 --> 00:16:41.971
There's no question that some choice
is better than none.

00:16:42.567 --> 00:16:44.614
But it doesn't follow from that

00:16:44.638 --> 00:16:47.085
that more choice
is better than some choice.

00:16:47.109 --> 00:16:49.647
There's some magical amount.
I don't know what it is.

00:16:49.671 --> 00:16:52.698
I'm pretty confident that we have
long since passed the point

00:16:52.722 --> 00:16:55.087
where options improve our welfare.

00:16:55.452 --> 00:16:58.409
Now, as a policy matter --
I'm almost done --

00:16:58.433 --> 00:17:01.817
as a policy matter,
the thing to think about is this:

00:17:01.841 --> 00:17:06.790
what enables all of this choice
in industrial societies

00:17:06.814 --> 00:17:08.908
is material affluence.

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:11.286
There are lots of places in the world,

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:13.285
and we have heard about several of them,

00:17:13.309 --> 00:17:16.042
where their problem is not
that they have too much choice.

00:17:16.066 --> 00:17:17.955
Their problem is they have too little.

00:17:17.979 --> 00:17:21.559
So the stuff I'm talking about
is the peculiar problem

00:17:21.583 --> 00:17:24.648
of modern, affluent, Western societies.

00:17:24.672 --> 00:17:27.897
And what is so frustrating
and infuriating is this:

00:17:27.921 --> 00:17:29.718
Steve Levitt talked to you yesterday

00:17:29.742 --> 00:17:36.636
about how these expensive
and difficult-to-install child seats

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:38.358
don't help.

00:17:39.056 --> 00:17:40.661
It's a waste of money.

00:17:40.685 --> 00:17:45.501
What I'm telling you is that
these expensive, complicated choices --

00:17:45.525 --> 00:17:47.383
it's not simply that they don't help.

00:17:47.407 --> 00:17:48.976
They actually hurt.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.557
They actually make us worse off.

00:17:51.928 --> 00:17:55.679
If some of what enables
people in our societies

00:17:55.703 --> 00:17:57.702
to make all of the choices we make

00:17:57.726 --> 00:18:02.430
were shifted to societies
in which people have too few options,

00:18:02.454 --> 00:18:04.785
not only would those
people's lives be improved,

00:18:04.809 --> 00:18:06.934
but ours would be improved also.

00:18:06.958 --> 00:18:10.277
This is what economists call
a "Pareto-improving move."

00:18:10.301 --> 00:18:13.713
Income redistribution will make
everyone better off,

00:18:13.737 --> 00:18:15.149
not just poor people,

00:18:15.173 --> 00:18:18.080
because of how all this excess
choice plagues us.

00:18:18.722 --> 00:18:19.879
So to conclude.

00:18:19.903 --> 00:18:22.267
[You can be anything
you want to be -- no limits.]

00:18:22.291 --> 00:18:25.946
You're supposed to read this cartoon
and, being a sophisticated person, say,

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:30.359
"Ah! What does this fish know?
Nothing is possible in this fishbowl."

00:18:30.753 --> 00:18:33.607
Impoverished imagination,
a myopic view of the world --

00:18:33.631 --> 00:18:35.311
that's the way I read it at first.

00:18:35.335 --> 00:18:37.153
The more I thought about it, however,

00:18:37.177 --> 00:18:40.976
the more I came to the view
that this fish knows something.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.212
Because the truth of the matter is,

00:18:43.236 --> 00:18:47.469
if you shatter the fishbowl
so that everything is possible,

00:18:47.493 --> 00:18:48.906
you don't have freedom.

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:50.706
You have paralysis.

00:18:51.373 --> 00:18:54.905
If you shatter this fishbowl
so that everything is possible,

00:18:54.929 --> 00:18:57.701
you decrease satisfaction.

00:18:58.184 --> 00:19:01.804
You increase paralysis,
and you decrease satisfaction.

00:19:01.828 --> 00:19:03.493
Everybody needs a fishbowl.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.344
This one is almost
certainly too limited --

00:19:06.368 --> 00:19:09.373
perhaps even for the fish,
certainly for us.

00:19:09.397 --> 00:19:13.865
But the absence of some metaphorical
fishbowl is a recipe for misery

00:19:13.889 --> 00:19:15.674
and, I suspect, disaster.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.270
Thank you very much.

00:19:17.294 --> 00:19:18.936
(Applause)
