00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The global challenge that I want to talk to you about today

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
rarely makes the front pages.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
It, however, is enormous

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
in both scale and importance.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Look, you all are very well traveled;

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
this is TEDGlobal after all.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
But I do hope to take you to some places

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
you've never been to before.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So, let's start off in China.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
This photo was taken two weeks ago.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Actually, one indication is that little boy on my husband's shoulders

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
has just graduated from high school.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
(Laughter)

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
But this is Tiananmen Square.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Many of you have been there. It's not the real China.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Let me take you to the real China.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
This is in the Dabian Mountains

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
in the remote part of Hubei province in central China.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Dai Manju is 13 years old at the time the story starts.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
She lives with her parents,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
her two brothers and her great-aunt.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
They have a hut that has no electricity,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
no running water,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
no wristwatch, no bicycle.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And they share this great splendor

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
with a very large pig.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Dai Manju was in sixth grade when her parents said,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
"We're going to pull you out of school

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
because the 13-dollar school fees are too much for us.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
You're going to be spending the rest of your life in the rice paddies.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Why would we waste this money on you?"

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
This is what happens to girls in remote areas.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Turns out that Dai Manju was

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
the best pupil in her grade.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
She still made the two-hour trek to the schoolhouse

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and tried to catch every little bit of information

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
that seeped out of the doors.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
We wrote about her in The New York Times.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
We got a flood of donations --

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
mostly 13-dollar checks

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
because New York Times readers are very generous

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
in tiny amounts

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
(Laughter)

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
but then, we got a money transfer

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
for $10,000 --

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
really nice guy.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
We turned the money over to that man there, the principal of the school.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
He was delighted.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
He thought, "Oh, I can renovate the school.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I can give scholarships to all the girls,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
you know, if they work hard and stay in school.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
So Dai Manju basically

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
finished out middle school.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
She went to high school.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
She went to vocational school for accounting.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
She scouted for jobs down in Guangdong province in the south.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
She found a job, she scouted for jobs

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
for her classmates and her friends.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
She sent money back to her family.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
They built a new house,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
this time with running water,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
electricity, a bicycle,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
no pig.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
What we saw was a natural experiment.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
It is rare to get an exogenous investment

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
in girls' education.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And over the years, as we followed Dai Manju, we were able to see

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
that she was able to move out of a vicious cycle

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and into a virtuous cycle.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
She not only changed her own dynamic,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
she changed her household, she changed her family, her village.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
The village became a real standout.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Of course, most of China was flourishing at the time,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
but they were able to get a road built

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
to link them up to the rest of China.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And that brings me to my first major

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
of two tenets of "Half the Sky."

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
And that is that

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
the central moral challenge

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
of this century

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
is gender inequity.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
In the 19th century, it was slavery.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
In the 20th century, it was totalitarianism.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
The cause of our time

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
is the brutality that so many people

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
face around the world because of their gender.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
So some of you may be thinking,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
"Gosh, that's hyperbole.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
She's exaggerating."

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Well, let me ask you this question.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
How many of you think there are more males or more females in the world?

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Let me take a poll. How many of you think there are more males in the world?

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Hands up, please.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
How many of you think -- a few -- how many of you there are more females in the world?

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Okay, most of you.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Well, you know this latter group, you're wrong.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
There are, true enough,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
in Europe and the West,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
when women and men

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
have equal access to food and health care,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
there are more women, we live longer.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
But in most of the rest of the world, that's not the case.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
In fact, demographers have shown

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
that there are anywhere between 60 million

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
and 100 million

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
missing females in the current population.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
And, you know, it happens for several reasons.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
For instance, in the last half-century,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
more girls were discriminated to death

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
than all the people killed on all the battlefields

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
in the 20th century.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Sometimes it's also because of the sonogram.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Girls get aborted before they're even born

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
when there are scarce resources.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
This girl here, for instance,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
is in a feeding center in Ethiopia.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
The entire center was filled with girls like her.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
What's remarkable is that her brothers, in the same family,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
were totally fine.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
In India, in the first year of life,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
from zero to one,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
boy and girl babies basically survive at the same rate

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
because they depend upon the breast,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and the breast shows no son preference.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
From one to five,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
girls die at a 50 percent higher mortality rate

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
than boys, in all of India.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
The second tenet of "Half the Sky"

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
is that, let's put aside the morality of all the right and wrong of it all,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and just on a purely practical level,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
we think that

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
one of the best ways to fight poverty and to fight terrorism

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
is to educate girls

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
and to bring women into the formal labor force.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Poverty, for instance.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
There are three reasons why this is the case.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
For one, overpopulation is one of

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
the persistent causes of poverty.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And you know, when you educate a boy,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
his family tends to have fewer kids,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
but only slightly.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
When you educate a girl,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
she tends to have significantly fewer kids.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
The second reason is

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
it has to do with spending.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
It's kind of like the dirty, little secret of poverty,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
which is that,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
not only do poor people

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
take in very little income,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
but also, the income that they take in,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
they don't spend it very wisely,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
and unfortunately, most of that spending is done by men.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
So research has shown,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
if you look at people who live under two dollars a day --

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
one metric of poverty --

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
two percent of that take-home pay

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
goes to this basket here, in education.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
20 percent goes to a basket that is a combination of

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
alcohol, tobacco, sugary drinks --

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
and prostitution and festivals.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
If you just take four percentage points

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
and put it into this basket,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
you would have a transformative effect.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
The last reason has to do

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
with women being part of the solution, not the problem.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
You need to use scarce resources.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
It's a waste of resources if you don't use someone like Dai Manju.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Bill Gates put it very well

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
when he was traveling through Saudi Arabia.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
He was speaking to an audience much like yourselves.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
However, two-thirds of the way there was a barrier.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
On this side was men,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
and then the barrier, and this side was women.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
And someone from this side of the room got up and said,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
"Mr. Gates, we have here as our goal in Saudi Arabia

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
to be one of the top 10 countries

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
when it comes to technology.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Do you think we'll make it?"

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
So Bill Gates, as he was staring out at the audience, he said,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
"If you're not fully utilizing half the resources in your country,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
there is no way you will get anywhere near the top 10."

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
So here is Bill of Arabia.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
(Laughter)

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
So what would some of the specific challenges

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
look like?

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
I would say, on the top of the agenda

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
is sex trafficking.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
And I'll just say two things about this.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
The slavery at the peak of the slave trade

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
in the 1780s:

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
there were about 80,000 slaves

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
transported from Africa to the New World.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Now, modern slavery:

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
according to State Department rough statistics,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
there are about 800,000 -- 10 times the number --

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
that are trafficked across international borders.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
And that does not even include those

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
that are trafficked within country borders,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
which is a substantial portion.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
And if you look at

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
another factor, another contrast,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
a slave back then is worth

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
about $40,000

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
in today's money.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Today, you can buy a girl trafficked

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
for a few hundred dollars,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
which means she's actually more disposable.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
But you know, there is progress being made

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
in places like Cambodia and Thailand.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
We don't have to expect a world

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
where girls are bought and sold or killed.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
The second item on the agenda

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
is maternal mortality.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
You know, childbirth in this part of the world

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
is a wonderful event.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
In Niger, one in seven women

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
can expect to die during childbirth.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Around the world,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
one woman dies every minute and a half from childbirth.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
You know, it's not as though

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
we don't have the technological solution,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
but these women have three strikes against them:

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
they are poor, they are rural

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
and they are female.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
You know, for every woman who does die,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
there are 20 who survive

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
but end up with an injury.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
And the most devastating injury

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
is obstetric fistula.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
It's a tearing during obstructed labor

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
that leaves a woman incontinent.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Let me tell you about Mahabuba.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
She lives in Ethiopia.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
She was married against her will at age 13.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
She got pregnant, ran to the bush to have the baby,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
but you know, her body was very immature,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
and she ended up having obstructed labor.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
The baby died, and she ended up with a fistula.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
So that meant she was incontinent;

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
she couldn't control her wastes.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
In a word, she stank.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
The villagers thought she was cursed; they didn't know what to do with her.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
So finally, they put her at the edge of the village in a hut.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
They ripped off the door

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
so that the hyenas would get her at night.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
That night, there was a stick in the hut.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
She fought off the hyenas with that stick.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
And the next morning,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
she knew if she could get to a nearby village where there was a foreign missionary,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
she would be saved.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Because she had some damage to her nerves,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
she crawled all the way -- 30 miles --

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
to that doorstep, half dead.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
The foreign missionary opened the door,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
knew exactly what had happened,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
took her to a nearby fistula hospital in Addis Ababa,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
and she was repaired

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
with a 350-dollar operation.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
The doctors and nurses there noticed

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
that she was not only a survivor,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
she was really clever, and they made her a nurse.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
So now, Mahabuba,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
she is saving the lives

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
of hundreds, thousands, of women.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
She has become part of the solution, not the problem.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
She's moved out of a vicious cycle

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
and into a virtuous cycle.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
I've talked about some of the challenges,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
let me talk about some of the solutions,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
and there are predictable solutions.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
I've hinted at them: education

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
and also economic opportunity.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
So of course, when you educate a girl,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
she tends to get married later on in life,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
she tends to have kids later on in life, she tends to have fewer kids,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
and those kids that she does have,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
she educates them in a more enlightened fashion.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
With economic opportunity,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
it can be transformative.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Let me tell you about Saima.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
She lives in a small village outside Lahore, Pakistan.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
And at the time, she was miserable.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
She was beaten every single day

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
by her husband, who was unemployed.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
He was kind of a gambler type -- and unemployable, therefore --

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
and took his frustrations out on her.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Well, when she had her second daughter,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
her mother in-law told her son,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
"I think you'd better get a second wife.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Saima's not going to produce you a son."

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
This is when she had her second daughter.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
At the time, there was

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
a microlending group in the village

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
that gave her a 65-dollar loan.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Saima took that money,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
and she started an embroidery business.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
The merchants liked her embroidery; it sold very well,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
and they kept asking for more.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
And when she couldn't produce enough,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
she hired other women in the village.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Pretty soon she had 30 women in the village

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
working for her embroidery business.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
And then,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
when she had to transport all of the embroidery goods

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
from the village to the marketplace,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
she needed someone to help her do the transport,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
so she hired her husband.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
So now they're in it together.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
He does the transportation and distribution,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
and she does the production and sourcing.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
And now they have a third daughter,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
and the daughters, all of them, are being tutored in education

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
because Saima knows what's really important.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Which brings me to the final element, which is education.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Larry Summers, when he was chief economist at the World Bank,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
once said that, "It may well be

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
that the highest return on investment

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
in the developing world

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
is in girls' education."

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Let me tell you about Beatrice Biira.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Beatrice was living in Uganda

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
near the Congo border,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
and like Dai Manju, she didn't go to school.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Actually, she had never been to school,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
not to a lick, one day.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Her parents, again, said,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
"Why should we spend the money on her?

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
She's going to spend most of her life lugging water back and forth."

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Well, it just so happens, at that time,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000
there was a group in Connecticut

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
called the Niantic Community Church Group in Connecticut.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
They made a donation to an organization

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
based in Arkansas

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
called Heifer International.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Heifer sent two goats to Africa.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
One of them ended up with Beatrice's parents,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
and that goat had twins.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
The twins started producing milk.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
They sold the milk for cash.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
The cash started accumulating,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
and pretty soon the parents said,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
"You know, we've got enough money. Let's send Beatrice to school."

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
So at nine years of age,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Beatrice started in first grade --

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
after all, she'd never been to a lick of school --

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
with a six year-old.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
No matter, she was just delighted to be in school.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
She rocketed to the top of her class.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
She stayed at the top of her class

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
through elementary school, middle school,

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
and then in high school,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
she scored brilliantly on the national examinations

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
so that she became the first person in her village,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
ever, to come to the United States

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
on scholarship.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Two years ago,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
she graduated from Connecticut College.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
On the day of her graduation,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
she said, "I am the luckiest girl alive

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
because of a goat."

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
(Laughter)

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
And that goat was $120.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
So you see how transformative

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
little bits of help can be.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
But I want to give you a reality check.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Look: U.S. aid, helping people is not easy,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
and there have been books that have criticized U.S. aid.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
There's Bill Easterly's book.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
There's a book called "Dead Aid."

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
You know, the criticism is fair;

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
it isn't easy.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
You know, people say how

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
half of all water well projects, a year later, are failed.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
When I was in Zimbabwe,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
we were touring a place with the village chief --

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
he wanted to raise money for a secondary school --

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
and there was some construction a few yards away,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
and I said, "What's that?"

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
He sort of mumbled.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Turns out that it's a failed irrigation project.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
A few yards away was a failed chicken coop.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
One year, all the chickens died, and no one wanted to put the chickens in there.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
It's true, but we think that you don't through the baby out with the bathwater;

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
you actually improve.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
You learn from your mistakes, and you continuously improve.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
We also think that individuals

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
can make a difference, and they should,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
because individuals, together,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
we can all help create a movement.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
And a movement of men and women

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
is what's needed to bring about social change,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
change that will address

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
this great moral challenge.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
So then, I ask,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
what's in it for you?

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
You're probably asking that. Why should you care?

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
I will just leave you with two things.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
One is that research shows

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
that once you have

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
all of your material needs taken care of --

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
which most of us, all of us, here in this room do --

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
research shows that

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
there are very few things in life

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
that can actually elevate your level of happiness.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
One of those things

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
is contributing to a cause larger than yourself.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
And the second thing,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
it's an anecdote that I'll leave you with.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
And that is the story

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
of an aid worker in Darfur.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Here was a woman

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
who had worked in Darfur,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
seeing things that no human being should see.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Throughout her time there,

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
she was strong, she was steadfast.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
She never broke down.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
And then she came back to the United States

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
and was on break, Christmas break.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
She was in her grandmother's backyard,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
and she saw something that made her break down in tears.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
What that was

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
was a bird feeder.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
And she realized that she had the great fortune

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
to be born in a country

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
where we take security for granted,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
where we not only can feed, clothe

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
and house ourselves,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
but also provide for wild birds

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
so they don't go hungry in the winter.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
And she realized that with that great fortune

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
comes great responsibility.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
And so, like her,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
you, me,

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
we have all won the lottery of life.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
And so the question becomes:

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
how do we discharge that responsibility?

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
So, here's the cause.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
Join the movement.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Feel happier and help save the world.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
Thank you very much.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000
(Applause)
