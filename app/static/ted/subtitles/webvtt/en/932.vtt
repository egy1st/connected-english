00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
When I saw a piece of technology called Kinect --

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
it was called Natal -- I was inspired,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and I thought for a moment,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
maybe it's possible

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
to address that one problem of storytelling,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
to create a character

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
which seemed alive,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
which noticed me,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
that could look me in the eyes

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and feel real,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and sculpt a story about our relationship.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And so a year ago,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I showed this off

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
at a computer show called E3.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And this was a piece of technology

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
with someone called Claire interacting with this boy.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And there was a huge row online

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
about, "Hey, this can't be real."

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And so I waited till now

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
to have an actual demo

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
of the real tech.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Now, this tech incorporates

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
three big elements.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
The first is a Kinect camera,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
which will be out in November,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
some incredible AI

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
that was hidden in the dusty vaults,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
collecting dust

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
in Microsoft,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
plus our quite crude

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
attempts at AI

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
at a company called Lionhead,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
mixing all those things together

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
just to get to this one simple idea:

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
to create a real, living

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
being in a computer.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Now, I'll be honest with you

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and say that most of it

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
is just a trick,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
but it's a trick that actually works.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
So why don't we go over and have

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
a look at the demo now.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
This is Dimitri.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Dimitri, just waggle your arm around.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Now, you notice he's sitting.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
There are no controllers,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
no keyboards,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
or mice,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
or joysticks, or joypads.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
He is just going to use

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
his hand, his body and his voice,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
just like humans interact with their hands, body and voice.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
So let's move forward.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
You're going to meet Milo for the first time.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
We had to give him a problem

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
because when we first created Milo,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
we realized that he came across as a little bit of a brat,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
to be honest with you.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
He was quite a know-it-all,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and he wanted to kind of make you laugh.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
So the problem we introduced to him was this:

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
he's just moved house.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
He's moved from London

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
to New England, over in America.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
His parents are too busy

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
to listen to his problems,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and that's when he starts almost conjuring you up.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
So here he is

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
walking through the grass.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And you're able to interact with his world.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
The cool thing is, what we're doing

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
is we're changing the mind

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
of Milo constantly.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
That means no two people's Milos

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
can be the same.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
You're actually sculpting a human being here.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
So, he's discovering the garden.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
You're helping him discover the garden

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
by just pointing out these snails.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Very simple at the start.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
By the way, if you are a boy, it's snails;

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
if you're a girl, it's butterflies

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
because what we found was that girls hate snails.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
(Laughter)

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
So remember, this is the first time you've met him,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
and we really want to draw you in and make you more curious.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
His face, by the way,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
is fully AI-driven.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
We have complete control over his blush responses,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
the diameter of his nostrils

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
to denote stress.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
We actually do something called body matching.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
If you're leaning forward,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
he will try and slightly change

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
the neuro-linguistic nature of his face,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
because we went out with this strong idea:

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
how can we make you believe that something's real?

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Now we've used the hand.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
The other thing to use is your body.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Why not just, instead of pushing left and right

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
with a mouse or with a joypad,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
why not use your body just to lean on the chair --

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
again, relaxed?

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
You can lean back,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
but the camera will change its perspective

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
depending on which way you're looking.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
So Dimitri's now going to use --

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
he's used his hand; he's used his body.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
He's now going to use the other thing which is essential,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and that's his voice.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Now, the thing about voice is,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
our experience with voice recognition

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
is pretty awful, isn't it?

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
It never works.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
You order an airline ticket; you end up in Timbuktu.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
So we've tackled that problem,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
and we've come up with a solution, which we'll see in a second.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Milo: I could just squish it.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Peter Molyneux: What are you going to do, Dimitri?

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Female Voice: Squashing a snail may not seem important,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
but remember, even this choice

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
will affect how Milo develops.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Do you want Milo to squash it?

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
When you see the microphone,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
say ... (PM: Squash.) ... yes to decide.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Dimitri: Go on, Milo. Squash it.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
PM: No. That's the wrong thing to do.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Now look at his response.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
He said, "Go on, Milo. Squash it."

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
What we're using there is,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
we're using something, a piece of technology called Tellme.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
It's a company that Microsoft acquired some years ago.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
We've got a database of words which we recognize.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
We pick those words out.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
We also reference that

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
with the tonation database

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
that we build up of Dimitri's voice,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
or the user's voice.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Now we need to have a bit more engagement,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
and again, what we can do

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
is we can look at the body.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
And we'll do that in a second.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Milo: I wonder how deep it is.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Deep.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
PM: Okay. So what we're going to do now

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
is teach Milo to skim stones.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
We're actually teaching him.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
It's very, very interesting

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
that men, more than women,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
tend to be more competitive here.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
They're fine with teaching Milo for the first few throws,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
but then they want to beat Milo,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
where women,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
they're more nurturing about this.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Okay, this is skimming stones.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
How do you skim stones?

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
You stand up,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
and you skim the stone.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
It's that simple.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Just recognizing your body,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
recognizing the body's motions, the tech,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
understanding that you've gone

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
from sitting down to standing up.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Again, all of this is done

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
in the way us humans do things,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
and that's crucially important

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
if we want Milo to appear real.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Female Voice: See if you can inspire him to do any better.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Try hitting the boat.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Milo: Ahhh. So close.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
PM: That's Dimitri at his most competitive.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Now beaten an 11-year-old child. Well done.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Milo: Okay.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
PM: So, Milo's being called back in by his parents,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
giving us time to be alone

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
and to help him out.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Basically -- the bit that we missed at the start --

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
his parents had asked him to clean up his room.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And we're going to help him with this now.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
But this is going to be an introduction,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
and this is all about the deep psychology that we're trying to use.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
We're trying to introduce you

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
to what I believe is the most wonderful part,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
you being able to talk

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
in your natural voice to Milo.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Now, to do that, we needed a set up,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
like a magician's trick.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
And what we did was,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
we needed to give Milo this big problem.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
So as Dimitri

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
starts tidying up,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
you can overhear a conversation

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
that Milo's having with his parents.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Milo's Mom: Oh, you've got gravy all over the floor. (Milo: I didn't mean to!)

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Milo's Mom: That carpet is brand new.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
PM: So he's just spilled

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
a plate of sausages on the floor,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
on the brand-new carpet.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
We've all done it as parents; we've all done it as children.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Now's a chance for Dimitri

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
to kind of reassure and calm Milo down.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
It's all been too much for him.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
He's just moved house. He's got no friends.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Now is the time

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
when we open that portal

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
and allow you to talk to Milo.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Female Voice: Why don't you try saying something encouraging

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
to cheer Milo up.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Dimitri: Come on, Milo. You know what parents are like.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
They're always getting stressed.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Milo: What do they want to come here for anyway?

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
We don't know anyone.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Dimitri: Well, you've got a new school to go to.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
You're going to meet loads of cool, new friends.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Milo: I just really miss my old house, that's all.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Dimitri: Well, this is a pretty awesome house, Milo.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
You've got a cool garden to play in and a pond.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Milo: It was good skimming stones.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
This looks nice.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
You cleaned up my room.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Thanks.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
PM: So after three-quarters of an hour,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
he recognizes you.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
And I promise you, if you're sitting in front of this screen,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
that is a truly wonderful moment.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
And we're ready now

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
to tell a story about his childhood and his life,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
and it goes on,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
and he has, you know, many adventures.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Some of those adventures are a little bit dark or on the darker side.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Some of those adventures are wonderfully encouraging --

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
he's got to go to school.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
The cool thing is

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
that we're doing as well:

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
as you interact with him,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
you're able to put things into his world; he recognizes objects.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
His mind is based in a cloud.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
That means Milo's mind,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
as millions of people use it,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
will get smarter and cleverer.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
He'll recognize more objects

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
and thus understand more words.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
But for me,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
this is a wonderful opportunity

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
where technology, at last, can be connected with,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
where I am no longer restrained

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
by the finger I hold in my hand --

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
as far as a computer game's concerned --

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
or by the blandness of not being noticed

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
if you're watching a film or a book.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
And I love those revolutions,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
and I love the future that Milo brings.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Thank you very much indeed.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
(Applause)
