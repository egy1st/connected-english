00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This talk is about righting writing wrongs.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
No, the sound's not faulty -- righting writing wrongs.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The Middle East is huge,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and with all our problems, one thing's for sure: we love to laugh.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I think humor is a great way to celebrate our differences.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We need to take our responsibilities seriously,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
but not ourselves.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Don't get me wrong: it's not like we don't have comedy in the Middle East.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I grew up at a time when iconic actors

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
from Kuwait, Syria, Egypt

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
used laughter to unite the region,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
just as football can.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
(Laughter)

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Now is the time for us to laugh at ourselves,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
before others can laugh with us.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
This is the story of the rise and rise of stand-up comedy in the Middle East --

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
a stand-up uprising, if you will.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Working in London as TV maker and writer,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I quickly realized

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
that comedy connects audiences.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Now, the best breeding ground for good comic writing

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
is the stand-up comedy circuit,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
where they just happen to say that you kill when you do well

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and you bomb when you do badly.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
An unfortunate connection for us maybe,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
but it reminds me

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
that we'd like to thank one man for, over the past decade,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
working tirelessly

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
to support comedians all around the world,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
specifically comedians

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
with a Middle Eastern background.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
(Applause)

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Like my good friends, Dean and Maysoon, at the bottom of the screen,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
who, two years after 9/11,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
started a festival to change the way

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Middle Easterners are perceived in the world.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
It's still going strong, with positive press to die for.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Also, three guys working for years in Los Angeles,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
an Iranian, a Palestinian and an Egyptian,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
created the aptly named Axis of Evil comedy act.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And wherever they went,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
they killed.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Now, I didn't start this fire, but I did pour petrol on it.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I moved to Dubai as the head of original content

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
for a Western TV network.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
My job was to connect the brand with a Middle Eastern audience.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Now, the American head of programming

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
wanted new local Arabic comedy.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
In a thick Arabic accent, my brain went,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
"Berfect."

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
(Laughter)

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Now, I had friends in the U.S.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
who had started a successful new tribe.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And I had every intention of taking this tribe

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
from being outliers in the Middle East

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
and pushing them over the tipping point

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
towards success.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Now, as with any new idea, it wasn't easy.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I had four phases to this plan.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
First, we'd need to buy content from the West and air it.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Then I'd bring my friends, and we'd show local amateurs how it's done.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
We would film that and air it,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and then I could work with the local amateurs and write new comedy.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
I excitedly presented this to the big boss,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and his reaction was, "Um, I don't get it."

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
So I retreated back to my cave

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and continued to support and produce comedy

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
and let my friends use my couch

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
as a regional operations hub.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Now, fast forward two years, to early 2007.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
The earth rotated, as did our management,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
(Laughter)

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
and as if by divine intervention,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
things came together

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
to help this revolution take shape.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Here's how the dots connected.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
First, the Axis guys recorded a Comedy Central special

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
that aired in the States,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
and it was getting great hits on YouTube.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Our new French CEO

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
believed in the power of positive PR ...

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
(Laughter)

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
and ideas du bon marche.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Let's just say "value for money."

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
I produced in Dubai a show for Ahmed Ahmed

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
to showcase his new Axis special to a packed room.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
I invited our new CEO,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and as soon as he realized we had a room packed full of laughing infidels,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
his reaction was very simple:

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
"Let's make this happen.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
And one more thing: No, don't F it up."

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
So I quickly went to work

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
with a great team around me.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
I happened to find

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
a funny guy to present it in Arabic,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
who is originally Korean,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
a perfect fit for the Axis of Evil.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
This is all true.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Now, while preparing for the tour,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
I had to remind the guys to be culturally sensitive.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
I used the three Bs of stand-up don'ts

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
as I call them in the Middle East:

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
blue content, keep it clean; beliefs, not religion;

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
and the third B, bolitics.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Stay away from bolitics in the Middle East.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Oh course, you might think, what's left

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
without bolitics, sex and religion, how can you make people laugh?

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
I'd say, watch any successful well-written,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
family-friendly sitcom in the West

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
for your answers.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Now, were the Axis successful?

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
In five countries, in just under a month,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
we had thousands of fanatical fans come and see them live.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
We had millions see them on TV and on TV news.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
In Jordan, we had His Majesty the King come and see them.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
In fact, they were so successful

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
that you could buy a pirated copy of their DVD,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
even before it was released in the Middle East.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Anywhere you go.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
So everywhere we went,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
we auditioned amateurs.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
We filmed that process and aired a documentary.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
I called it "Three Guys and Wonho."

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
It really is his name.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
And all this TV and Internet exposure

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
has led to a great many

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
recruits to our cause.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
In Dubai this year, we've just had

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
the first all-women's, homegrown stand-up show.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
And notice two of them are wearing headscarves,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
and yes, even they can laugh.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Dubai, to me, is like a hand

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
that supports anyone who wants to make things happen.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
20 years ago,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
no one had heard of it.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Look at it now.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
With an inspirational leader, I think this year,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
the opening of the tallest tower in the world

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
is like adding a finger to that hand,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
that points at all those

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
who spread fallacious stories about us.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
(Laughter)

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
(Applause)

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Now, in three short years, we've come a long way

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
with stand-up comedy shows happening even in Saudi Arabia.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
These comics are now going to the New York festival.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
And the Lebanese, brilliant Lebanese,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Nemr Abou Nassar, we featured in our first tour,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
has just been performing in L.A.'s legendary comedy clubs.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
So clearly, from the inside, we are doing our best to change our image,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
and it's exploding.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
(Laughter)

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
So, as for the outsiders looking in,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
watch the CNN report on the second Amman Comedy Festival.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
The reporter did a great job, and I thank her,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
but somebody forgot to send the positive PR email

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
to the person operating the automatic news ticker that appears at the bottom.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
For example, when Dean talks,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
the ticker says, "U.S.: Suspect gave 'actionable intel."

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Well, if you're used to listening to comedians,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
then I'm not surprised.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Sadly, this leads me to another three Bs

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
that represents how the media in the West

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
talks about us as bombers, billionaires

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
and belly dancers.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Enough.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
We're not all angry fanatics

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
who want to kill the infidel.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
We have a positive story to tell

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
and image to sell.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
In fact, one thing's for sure, in my experience,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
we love to laugh like hell.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
(Laughter)

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Here are three questions that I like to use

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
to test the truthiness of our representation

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
in any media story.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
One: Is the Middle East

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
being shown in a current time

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
and correct context?

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
(Laughter)

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Two: Do the Middle Eastern characters

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
laugh or smile

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
without showing the whites of their eyes?

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
(Laughter)

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Three: Is the Middle Eastern character

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
being played by one?

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Clearly, there are wrongs that need to be righted.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
We've started in our region.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
My challenge to the rest of the world

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
is please, start using

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
positive Middle Eastern images in your stories.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
For inspiration, go to one of our festivals,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
go online, drop us a line.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Let's change the narrative together

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
and let's start righting writing wrongs.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
I'd like to end, before going back to the Middle East,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
with a quote from one of the greatest Sheikhs

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
to put quill to parchment.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
As my father likes to call him, "Asheikh Azubare;"

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
as my mother would say, "Shakespeare."

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
(Laughter)

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
"And now we go in content

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
to liberty and not to banishment."

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Thank you.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
(Applause)
