WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.476
I was one of the founding members
of the Axis of Evil Comedy Tour.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.071
The other founding members
included Ahmed Ahmed,

00:00:07.095 --> 00:00:10.046
who is an Egyptian-American,
who actually had the idea

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.349
to go to the Middle East and try it out
before we went out as a tour.

00:00:13.373 --> 00:00:15.027
He went out solo and did it first.

00:00:15.051 --> 00:00:17.976
Then there was Aron Kader,
who was the Palestinian-American.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.976
And then there was me,
the Iranian-American of the group.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.996
Now, being Iranian-American
presents its own set of problems,

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.191
as you know.

00:00:25.215 --> 00:00:27.692
Those two countries
aren't getting along these days.

00:00:27.716 --> 00:00:29.976
So it causes a lot of inner
conflict, you know,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.182
like part of me likes me,
part of me hates me.

00:00:32.206 --> 00:00:33.206
(Laughter)

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.587
Part of me thinks I should
have a nuclear program,

00:00:35.611 --> 00:00:38.042
the other part thinks
I can't be trusted with one.

00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:40.678
These are dilemmas I have every day.

00:00:40.702 --> 00:00:43.429
But I was born in Iran;
I'm now an American citizen,

00:00:43.453 --> 00:00:45.429
which means I have the American passport,

00:00:45.453 --> 00:00:46.821
which means I can travel.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.191
Because if you only have
the Iranian passport,

00:00:50.215 --> 00:00:53.716
you're kind of limited to the countries
you can go to with open arms,

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.016
you know -- Syria, Venezuela, North Korea.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.440
(Laughter)

00:00:58.887 --> 00:01:02.244
So, anyone who's gotten their passport
in America will tell you,

00:01:02.268 --> 00:01:05.175
when you get it, it still says
what country you were born in.

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.234
So I remember getting
my American passport.

00:01:07.258 --> 00:01:09.318
I was like, "Woo-hoo!
I'm going to travel."

00:01:09.342 --> 00:01:12.868
And I opened it up, it said, "Born
in Iran." I'm like, "Oh, come on, man!"

00:01:12.892 --> 00:01:13.917
(Laughter)

00:01:13.941 --> 00:01:15.211
"I'm trying to go places."

00:01:15.235 --> 00:01:16.295
(Laughter)

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:17.561
But what's interesting is,

00:01:17.585 --> 00:01:21.097
I've never had trouble in any Western
countries with my American passport,

00:01:21.121 --> 00:01:23.531
even though it says,
"Born in Iran" -- no problems.

00:01:23.555 --> 00:01:26.234
Where I've had problems
is in some of the Arab countries.

00:01:26.258 --> 00:01:29.739
I guess some of the Arab countries
aren't getting along with Iran either.

00:01:29.763 --> 00:01:32.059
So I was in Kuwait recently,
doing a comedy show

00:01:32.083 --> 00:01:33.778
with some other American comedians.

00:01:33.802 --> 00:01:34.955
They all went through.

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.577
Then the border patrol saw my American
passport: "Ah-ha! American, great."

00:01:38.601 --> 00:01:40.650
Then he opened it up.
"Born in Iran? Wait."

00:01:40.674 --> 00:01:42.210
(Laughter)

00:01:42.234 --> 00:01:43.930
And he started asking me questions.

00:01:43.954 --> 00:01:45.930
He said, "What is your father's name?"

00:01:46.424 --> 00:01:49.493
I said, "Well, he's passed away,
but his name was Khosro."

00:01:49.517 --> 00:01:51.922
He goes, "What
is your grandfather's name?"

00:01:51.946 --> 00:01:53.990
I said, "He passed away a long time ago.

00:01:54.014 --> 00:01:55.558
His name was Jabbar."

00:01:55.582 --> 00:01:58.138
He says, "You wait. I'll be back,"
and he walked away.

00:01:58.162 --> 00:01:59.455
And I started freaking out,

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.499
because I don't know what kind
of crap my grandfather was into.

00:02:02.523 --> 00:02:04.731
(Laughter)

00:02:04.755 --> 00:02:07.175
Thought the guy was going
to come back and be like,

00:02:07.199 --> 00:02:09.248
"We've been looking
for you for 200 years."

00:02:09.272 --> 00:02:12.174
(Laughter)

00:02:12.198 --> 00:02:15.339
"Your grandfather has
a parking violation. It's way overdue.

00:02:15.761 --> 00:02:17.554
You owe us two billion dollars."

00:02:17.578 --> 00:02:19.046
(Laughter)

00:02:19.274 --> 00:02:22.427
But as you can see, when I talk,
I speak with an American accent,

00:02:22.451 --> 00:02:25.078
which you would think,
as an Iranian-American actor,

00:02:25.102 --> 00:02:27.977
I should be able to play any part,
good, bad, what have you.

00:02:28.001 --> 00:02:29.582
But a lot of times in Hollywood,

00:02:29.606 --> 00:02:32.672
when casting directors find out
you're of Middle Eastern descent,

00:02:32.696 --> 00:02:34.415
they go, "Oh, you're Iranian. Great!

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:37.118
Can you say 'I will kill you
in the name of Allah?'"

00:02:37.142 --> 00:02:39.561
I go, "I could say that,
but what if I were to say,

00:02:39.585 --> 00:02:40.976
'Hello. I'm your doctor'?"

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.631
They go, "Great! And then
you hijack the hospital."

00:02:43.655 --> 00:02:48.416
(Laughter)

00:02:49.096 --> 00:02:51.272
Like, I think you're
missing the point here.

00:02:51.896 --> 00:02:54.270
Don't get me wrong,
I don't mind playing bad guys.

00:02:54.294 --> 00:02:56.493
I want to play a bad guy.
I want to rob a bank.

00:02:56.517 --> 00:02:58.323
I want to rob a bank in a film,

00:02:58.347 --> 00:03:01.620
but do it with a gun, not with a bomb
strapped around me, right?

00:03:01.644 --> 00:03:02.860
(Laughter)

00:03:02.884 --> 00:03:05.858
Because I imagine the director:
"Maz, I think your character

00:03:05.882 --> 00:03:07.976
would rob the bank
with a bomb around him."

00:03:08.507 --> 00:03:09.935
"Why would I do that?

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.976
If I want the money,
why would I kill myself?"

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.091
(Laughter)

00:03:16.115 --> 00:03:17.291
Right?

00:03:17.315 --> 00:03:20.250
(Applause)

00:03:20.274 --> 00:03:22.661
"Gimme all your money,
or I'll blow myself up!"

00:03:22.685 --> 00:03:26.438
(Laughter)

00:03:26.555 --> 00:03:28.280
"Well, then blow yourself up.

00:03:28.304 --> 00:03:29.454
(Laughter)

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:31.132
Just do it outside, please."

00:03:31.156 --> 00:03:34.681
(Laughter)

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.262
But the fact is, there's good
people everywhere.

00:03:37.286 --> 00:03:40.402
That's what I try and show in my stand-up,
good people everywhere.

00:03:40.426 --> 00:03:42.387
All it takes in one person to mess it up.

00:03:42.411 --> 00:03:44.889
Like a couple months ago
in Times Square in New York,

00:03:44.913 --> 00:03:47.973
there was a Pakistani Muslim guy
who tried to blow up a car bomb.

00:03:47.997 --> 00:03:51.239
Now, I happened to be in Times Square
that night doing a comedy show.

00:03:51.263 --> 00:03:54.889
And a few months before that, there
was a white American guy in Austin, Texas

00:03:54.913 --> 00:03:57.520
who flew his airplane
into the IRS building,

00:03:57.627 --> 00:04:01.976
and I happened to be in Austin that day
doing a stand-up comedy show.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.096
Now I'll tell you,
as a Middle-Eastern male,

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.864
when you show up around a lot
of these activities,

00:04:06.888 --> 00:04:08.834
you start feeling guilty at one point.

00:04:08.858 --> 00:04:09.859
(Laughter)

00:04:09.883 --> 00:04:12.972
I was watching the news. I'm like,
"Am I involved in this crap?"

00:04:12.996 --> 00:04:17.896
(Laughter)

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.102
"I didn't get the memo. What's going on?"

00:04:20.126 --> 00:04:22.051
(Laughter)

00:04:22.075 --> 00:04:23.468
But what was interesting was,

00:04:23.492 --> 00:04:26.503
the Pakistani Muslim guy --
see, he gives a bad name to Muslims

00:04:26.527 --> 00:04:29.437
and Middle Easterners and Pakistanis
from all over the world.

00:04:29.461 --> 00:04:32.558
And one thing that happened there
was also the Pakistani Taliban

00:04:32.582 --> 00:04:34.641
took credit for that failed car bombing.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.274
My question is: Why would you take credit
for a failed car bombing?

00:04:39.298 --> 00:04:40.832
"We just want to say:

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:42.719
we tried."

00:04:42.743 --> 00:04:45.767
(Laughter)

00:04:47.152 --> 00:04:48.628
"And furthermore ...

00:04:48.652 --> 00:04:49.801
(Laughter)

00:04:49.825 --> 00:04:51.424
it is the thought that counts."

00:04:51.448 --> 00:04:53.146
(Laughter)

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:59.892
(Applause)

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.110
"And in conclusion, win some, lose some."

00:05:02.134 --> 00:05:04.175
(Laughter)

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:07.749
But what happened was, when the white guy
flew his plane into the building,

00:05:07.773 --> 00:05:10.638
I know all my Middle Eastern
and Muslim friends in the States

00:05:10.662 --> 00:05:11.818
were watching TV, going,

00:05:11.842 --> 00:05:14.902
"Please, don't be Middle Eastern.
Don't be Hassan or Hussein."

00:05:14.926 --> 00:05:19.110
And the name came out: Jack.
I'm like, "Woooo! That's not one of us!"

00:05:19.241 --> 00:05:21.785
But I kept watching the news
in case they came back,

00:05:21.809 --> 00:05:24.595
and were like, "Before he did it,
he converted to Islam."

00:05:24.619 --> 00:05:26.154
"Damn it! Why Jack? Why?"

00:05:28.621 --> 00:05:30.246
But the fact is, I've been lucky

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.438
to get a chance to perform
all over the world,

00:05:32.462 --> 00:05:34.571
and I did a lot of shows
in the Middle East.

00:05:34.595 --> 00:05:36.388
I just did a seven-country solo tour.

00:05:36.412 --> 00:05:38.730
I was in Oman, and I was in Saudi Arabia.

00:05:38.754 --> 00:05:39.976
I was in Dubai.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.199
And it's great, there's good
people everywhere.

00:05:42.223 --> 00:05:44.374
And you learn great things
about these places.

00:05:44.398 --> 00:05:46.822
I encourage people always
to go visit these places.

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:48.424
For example, Dubai -- cool place.

00:05:48.448 --> 00:05:52.008
They're obsessed with having the biggest,
tallest, longest, as we all know.

00:05:52.032 --> 00:05:53.954
They have a mall there, the Dubai Mall.

00:05:53.978 --> 00:05:56.077
It is so big, they have taxis in the mall.

00:05:56.668 --> 00:06:00.303
I was walking. I heard, "Beep! Beep!"
I'm like, "What are you doing here?"

00:06:00.327 --> 00:06:03.223
He goes, "I'm going to the Zara store.
It's three miles away.

00:06:03.247 --> 00:06:05.551
Out of my way. Out of my way.
Out of my way."

00:06:05.575 --> 00:06:06.825
(Laughter)

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:09.917
And what's crazy -- there's a recession
going on, even in Dubai,

00:06:09.941 --> 00:06:11.715
but you wouldn't know by the prices.

00:06:11.739 --> 00:06:15.011
Like in the Dubai Mall,
they sell frozen yogurt by the gram.

00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:17.279
It's like a drug deal.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.976
I was walking by. The guy goes,
"Psst! Habibi, my friend."

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.140
(Laughter)

00:06:23.164 --> 00:06:24.793
"You want some frozen yogurt?

00:06:24.817 --> 00:06:26.364
(Laughter)

00:06:26.388 --> 00:06:28.034
Come here. Come here. Come here.

00:06:28.505 --> 00:06:31.589
I have one gram, five gram, 10 gram.
How many gram do you want?"

00:06:31.613 --> 00:06:32.653
(Laughter)

00:06:32.677 --> 00:06:35.976
I bought five grams. 10 dollars.
10 dollars! I said, "What's in this?"

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.740
He's like, "Good stuff, man.
Colombian. Top of the line."

00:06:38.764 --> 00:06:39.802
(Laughter)

00:06:39.826 --> 00:06:42.704
The other thing you learn
when you travel in these countries,

00:06:42.728 --> 00:06:45.604
in the Middle East, Latin American,
South American countries,

00:06:45.628 --> 00:06:48.976
a lot of times when they build stuff,
there's no rules and regulations.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.636
For example, I took my two-year-old son
to the playground at the Dubai Mall.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.571
And I've taken him to playgrounds
all over the United States.

00:06:55.595 --> 00:06:58.792
And when you put your two-year-old
on a slide in the United States,

00:06:58.816 --> 00:07:00.731
they put something on the slide

00:07:00.755 --> 00:07:03.311
to slow the kid down
as he comes down the slide.

00:07:03.843 --> 00:07:05.433
Not in the Middle East.

00:07:05.457 --> 00:07:07.433
(Laughter)

00:07:07.928 --> 00:07:11.153
I put my two-year-old on the slide,
he went whoosh! He took off!

00:07:11.177 --> 00:07:12.279
(Laughter)

00:07:12.303 --> 00:07:15.918
I went down and, "Where's my son?"
"On the third floor, sir. Third floor."

00:07:15.942 --> 00:07:17.856
(Laughter)

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.239
"You take a taxi.
You go to Zara. Make a left."

00:07:20.263 --> 00:07:21.989
(Laughter)

00:07:22.823 --> 00:07:25.540
"Try the yogurt. It's very good.
Little expensive."

00:07:25.564 --> 00:07:27.647
(Laughter)

00:07:27.671 --> 00:07:30.717
But one thing I try to do
with my stand-up is break stereotypes.

00:07:30.741 --> 00:07:32.854
And I've been guilty
of stereotyping as well.

00:07:32.878 --> 00:07:35.842
I was in Dubai. And there's a lot
of Indians who work in Dubai.

00:07:35.866 --> 00:07:37.497
And they don't get paid that well.

00:07:37.521 --> 00:07:40.398
And I got it in my head that all
the Indians must be workers.

00:07:40.422 --> 00:07:43.236
I forgot there's obviously
successful Indians in Dubai too.

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.677
I was doing a show, and they said,
"We'll send a driver to pick you up."

00:07:46.701 --> 00:07:49.071
I went down to the lobby,
and saw this Indian guy.

00:07:49.095 --> 00:07:50.488
I go, "He must be my driver,"

00:07:50.512 --> 00:07:53.921
since he's standing there in a cheap
suit, thin mustache, staring at me.

00:07:53.945 --> 00:07:55.799
I say, "Excuse me, are you my driver?"

00:07:55.823 --> 00:07:57.600
He goes, "No, sir. I own the hotel."

00:07:57.624 --> 00:08:00.743
(Laughter)

00:08:02.094 --> 00:08:04.312
I go, "I'm sorry!
Why were you staring at me?"

00:08:04.336 --> 00:08:06.378
He goes, "I thought you were my driver."

00:08:06.402 --> 00:08:08.912
(Laughter)

00:08:08.936 --> 00:08:15.936
(Applause)

00:08:17.213 --> 00:08:20.138
(Laughter)

00:08:20.162 --> 00:08:23.543
I'll leave you with this: I try,
with my stand-up, to break stereotypes,

00:08:23.567 --> 00:08:26.327
present Middle Easterners
and Muslims in a positive light.

00:08:26.351 --> 00:08:27.926
I hope that in the coming years,

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:30.631
more film and television programs
come out of Hollywood,

00:08:30.655 --> 00:08:32.433
presenting us in a positive light.

00:08:32.457 --> 00:08:35.963
Who knows? Maybe one day,
we'll even have our own James Bond. Right?

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:37.570
"My name is Bond.

00:08:37.594 --> 00:08:38.755
Jamal Bond."

00:08:38.779 --> 00:08:40.222
(Laughter)

00:08:40.246 --> 00:08:42.969
Til then, I'll keep telling jokes.
Hope you keep laughing.

00:08:42.993 --> 00:08:44.290
Have a good day. Thank you.

00:08:44.314 --> 00:08:51.314
(Applause)
