WEBVTT

00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:03.834
My name's Seth Priebatsch.
I'm the chief ninja of SCVNGR.

00:00:03.858 --> 00:00:05.326
I'm a proud Princeton dropout.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.404
Also proud to have relocated
here to Boston,

00:00:07.428 --> 00:00:08.975
where I actually grew up.

00:00:08.999 --> 00:00:10.779
(Applause) Yeah, Boston.

00:00:10.803 --> 00:00:14.105
Easy wins, I should just name
the counties that we've got around here.

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:16.320
I'm also fairly determined
to try and build

00:00:16.344 --> 00:00:17.933
a game layer on top of the world.

00:00:17.957 --> 00:00:20.617
This is sort of a new concept
and it's really important,

00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:23.738
because while the last decade
was the decade of social,

00:00:23.762 --> 00:00:27.543
the decade where the framework in which
we connect with other people was built,

00:00:27.567 --> 00:00:31.890
this next decade will be the decade
where the game framework is built,

00:00:31.914 --> 00:00:34.842
where the motivations we use
to actually influence behavior

00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:37.081
and the framework
in which that is constructed,

00:00:37.105 --> 00:00:39.224
is decided upon,
and that's really important.

00:00:39.248 --> 00:00:41.827
I say I want to build a game layer
on top of the world,

00:00:41.851 --> 00:00:43.102
but that's not quite true,

00:00:43.126 --> 00:00:46.276
because it's already under construction;
it's already happening.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.160
And it looks like this right now.

00:00:48.184 --> 00:00:50.976
It looks like the Web did
back in 1997, right?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.926
It's not very good. It's cluttered.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.840
It's filled with lots of different things
that, in short, aren't that fun.

00:00:56.864 --> 00:01:00.108
There are credit card schemes
and airline mile programs,

00:01:00.132 --> 00:01:02.772
coupon cards and all these loyalty schemes

00:01:02.796 --> 00:01:06.657
that actually do use game dynamics
and are building the game layer --

00:01:06.681 --> 00:01:07.976
they just suck.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.065
They're not very well-designed.

00:01:10.089 --> 00:01:11.133
(Laughter)

00:01:11.157 --> 00:01:12.701
So that's unfortunate.

00:01:12.725 --> 00:01:16.883
But luckily, as my favorite action
hero, Bob the Builder, says,

00:01:16.907 --> 00:01:19.143
"We can do better.
We can build this better."

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:22.976
And the tools, the resources
that we use to build a game layer,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.809
are game dynamics themselves.

00:01:24.833 --> 00:01:27.602
And so the crux of this presentation
is going to go through

00:01:27.626 --> 00:01:29.364
four really important game dynamics,

00:01:29.388 --> 00:01:32.173
really interesting things,
that, if you use consciously,

00:01:32.197 --> 00:01:34.976
you can use to influence behavior,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.357
both for good, for bad, for in-between.

00:01:37.381 --> 00:01:38.680
Hopefully for good.

00:01:38.704 --> 00:01:42.704
But this is the important stage
in which that framework will get built,

00:01:42.728 --> 00:01:45.825
and so we want to all be thinking
about it consciously now.

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:48.106
Before we jump into that,
there's a question of:

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.281
Why is this important?

00:01:49.305 --> 00:01:50.459
I'm making this claim

00:01:50.483 --> 00:01:52.633
that there's a game layer
on top of the world,

00:01:52.657 --> 00:01:54.995
and it's very important
that we build it properly.

00:01:55.019 --> 00:01:57.689
The reason it's so important
is that, in the last decade,

00:01:57.713 --> 00:02:00.599
what we've seen has been
building the social layer,

00:02:00.623 --> 00:02:03.091
has been this framework for connections,

00:02:03.115 --> 00:02:06.679
and construction on that layer
is over, it's finished.

00:02:06.703 --> 00:02:08.181
There's still a lot to explore,

00:02:08.205 --> 00:02:10.496
still a lot of people
trying to figure out social

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.622
and how we leverage this
and how we use this,

00:02:12.646 --> 00:02:14.429
but the framework itself is done,

00:02:14.453 --> 00:02:15.939
and it's called Facebook.

00:02:16.915 --> 00:02:20.286
And that's OK, right? A lot of people
are very happy with Facebook.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.899
I like it quite a lot.

00:02:21.923 --> 00:02:24.226
They've created this thing
called the Open Graph,

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.976
and they own all of our connections.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.607
They own half a billion people.

00:02:27.631 --> 00:02:29.815
So when you want to build
on the social layer,

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:33.051
the framework has been decided;
it is the Open Graph API.

00:02:33.075 --> 00:02:35.085
And if you're happy with that, fantastic.

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:37.827
If you're not, too bad.
There's nothing you can do.

00:02:38.287 --> 00:02:40.976
And that's a real thing.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.976
I mean, we want to build frameworks
in a way that makes it acceptable

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.087
and makes it productive down the road.

00:02:48.111 --> 00:02:50.729
So, the social layer
is all about these connections.

00:02:51.235 --> 00:02:53.647
The game layer is all about influence.

00:02:53.671 --> 00:02:55.915
It's not about adding
a social fabric to the web

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:57.566
and connecting you to other people

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.544
everywhere you are and everywhere you go,

00:02:59.568 --> 00:03:01.864
it's actually about using
dynamics, using forces,

00:03:01.888 --> 00:03:05.016
to influence the behavior
of where you are, what you do there,

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.193
how you do it.

00:03:06.217 --> 00:03:07.711
That's really, really powerful.

00:03:07.735 --> 00:03:10.467
And it's going to be more important
than the social layer,

00:03:10.491 --> 00:03:13.386
and affect our lives more deeply
and perhaps more invisibly.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.208
So it's incredibly critical
that at this moment,

00:03:16.232 --> 00:03:17.952
while it's just getting constructed,

00:03:17.976 --> 00:03:20.282
while the frameworks
like Facebook or Open Graph

00:03:20.306 --> 00:03:22.576
are being created
for the game-layer equivalent,

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.524
that we think about it very consciously,

00:03:24.548 --> 00:03:26.936
and that we do it in a way
that is open, available,

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.449
and can be leveraged for good.

00:03:28.473 --> 00:03:31.003
So that's what I want to talk
about for game dynamics,

00:03:31.027 --> 00:03:32.750
because construction has just begun,

00:03:32.774 --> 00:03:35.123
and the more consciously
we can think about this,

00:03:35.147 --> 00:03:38.211
the better we'll be able to use it
for anything we want.

00:03:38.235 --> 00:03:41.381
So like I said, the way you go
through and build on the game layer

00:03:41.405 --> 00:03:44.532
is not with glass and steel and cement.

00:03:44.556 --> 00:03:47.767
And the resources we use are not
this two-dimensional swath of land

00:03:47.791 --> 00:03:48.947
that we have.

00:03:48.971 --> 00:03:50.320
The resources are mindshare,

00:03:50.344 --> 00:03:53.128
and the tools, the raw materials,
are these game dynamics.

00:03:53.152 --> 00:03:55.405
With that, a couple
game dynamics to talk about.

00:03:55.877 --> 00:03:57.402
Back at SCVNGR, we like to joke

00:03:57.426 --> 00:04:00.498
that with seven game dynamics,
you can get anyone to do anything.

00:04:00.522 --> 00:04:02.160
Today, I'm going to show you four,

00:04:02.184 --> 00:04:05.662
because I hope to have a competitive
advantage at the end of this, still.

00:04:05.686 --> 00:04:07.817
(Laughter)

00:04:07.841 --> 00:04:10.353
So the first one,
it's a very simple game dynamic.

00:04:10.377 --> 00:04:12.169
It's called the appointment dynamic.

00:04:12.193 --> 00:04:14.000
It's a dynamic in which to succeed,

00:04:14.024 --> 00:04:16.405
players have to do something
at a predefined time,

00:04:16.429 --> 00:04:18.111
generally at a predefined place.

00:04:18.135 --> 00:04:20.411
And these dynamics
are a little scary sometimes,

00:04:20.435 --> 00:04:23.175
because you think, "Other people
can be using forces

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:25.075
that will manipulate how I interact:

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:27.076
what I do, where I do it, when I do it."

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.588
This sort of "loss of free will"
that occurs in games

00:04:29.612 --> 00:04:30.851
can be frightening.

00:04:30.875 --> 00:04:33.460
So with each dynamic,
I'm going to give three examples:

00:04:33.484 --> 00:04:36.350
one that shows how it's already
being used in the real world,

00:04:36.374 --> 00:04:38.000
so you can rationalize it a bit;

00:04:38.024 --> 00:04:40.842
one that shows it in what we consider
a conventional game --

00:04:40.866 --> 00:04:42.258
I think everything is a game,

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:45.297
but this is more what you'd think
of as a game played on a board

00:04:45.321 --> 00:04:46.474
or on a computer screen;

00:04:46.498 --> 00:04:48.365
and one of how it can be used for good,

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.947
so you can see that these forces
can be very powerful.

00:04:50.971 --> 00:04:54.154
So the first one, the most famous
appointment dynamic in the world,

00:04:54.178 --> 00:04:55.915
is something called, "Happy Hour."

00:04:56.396 --> 00:04:58.878
So I had just recently
dropped out of Princeton

00:04:58.902 --> 00:05:01.395
and actually ended up
for the first time in a bar,

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:04.189
and I saw these happy hour things
all over the place.

00:05:04.213 --> 00:05:07.617
And this is simply an appointment dynamic:
come here at a certain time,

00:05:07.641 --> 00:05:08.839
get your drinks half off.

00:05:08.863 --> 00:05:12.407
To win, all you have to do is show up
at the right place at the right time.

00:05:12.431 --> 00:05:14.046
This game dynamic is so powerful,

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.630
it doesn't just influence our behavior;
it's influenced our entire culture.

00:05:17.654 --> 00:05:19.090
That's a really scary thought,

00:05:19.114 --> 00:05:21.851
that one game dynamic
can change things so powerfully.

00:05:21.875 --> 00:05:24.070
It also exists in more
conventional game forms.

00:05:24.094 --> 00:05:26.245
I'm sure you've all heard
of Farmville by now.

00:05:26.269 --> 00:05:28.155
If you haven't, I recommend playing it.

00:05:28.179 --> 00:05:30.648
You won't do anything else
for the rest of your day.

00:05:30.672 --> 00:05:32.800
Farmville has more active
users than Twitter.

00:05:32.824 --> 00:05:34.031
It's incredibly powerful,

00:05:34.055 --> 00:05:37.172
and it has this dynamic
where you have to return at a certain time

00:05:37.196 --> 00:05:39.768
to water your fake crops, or they wilt.

00:05:40.156 --> 00:05:43.368
And this is so powerful
that when they tweak their stats,

00:05:43.392 --> 00:05:45.201
when they say your crops wilt

00:05:45.225 --> 00:05:47.976
after eight hours, or after six hours,
or after 24 hours,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.567
it changes the life cycle
of some 70 million people during the day.

00:05:52.591 --> 00:05:55.209
They will return, like clockwork,
at different times.

00:05:55.233 --> 00:05:58.623
So if they wanted the world to end,
if they wanted productivity to stop,

00:05:58.647 --> 00:06:00.417
they could make it a 30-minute cycle,

00:06:00.441 --> 00:06:02.435
and no one could do anything else, right?

00:06:02.459 --> 00:06:03.975
(Laughter)

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:05.467
That's a little scary.

00:06:05.491 --> 00:06:07.753
But this could also be used for good.

00:06:07.777 --> 00:06:09.555
This local company called Vitality

00:06:09.579 --> 00:06:12.714
has created a product to help people
take their medicine on time.

00:06:12.738 --> 00:06:13.891
That's an appointment.

00:06:13.915 --> 00:06:16.090
It's something that people
don't do very well.

00:06:16.114 --> 00:06:18.510
They have these GlowCaps
which flash and email you

00:06:18.534 --> 00:06:21.137
and do cool things to remind you
to take your medicine.

00:06:21.161 --> 00:06:23.307
This isn't a game yet,
but really should be.

00:06:23.331 --> 00:06:25.389
You should get points for doing it on time

00:06:25.413 --> 00:06:27.379
and lose points for not doing it on time.

00:06:27.403 --> 00:06:30.174
They should recognize they've built
an appointment dynamic,

00:06:30.198 --> 00:06:31.349
and leverage the games.

00:06:31.373 --> 00:06:34.140
Then you can really achieve good
in some interesting ways.

00:06:34.164 --> 00:06:36.686
We're going to jump onto the next one.

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:37.975
Influence and status.

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:41.976
This is one of the most famous
game dynamics, used all over the place.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.105
It's used in your wallets, right now.

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:47.976
We all want that credit card
on the far left, because it's black.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.841
And you see someone at CVS or --

00:06:49.865 --> 00:06:51.532
not CVS -- like, Christian Dior --

00:06:51.556 --> 00:06:53.576
(Laughter)

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.868
I don't know. I don't have a black
card; I've got a debit card.

00:06:56.892 --> 00:06:58.677
(Laughter)

00:06:58.701 --> 00:07:01.304
So they whip it out and you see
that black card, and:

00:07:01.328 --> 00:07:03.915
"I want that because it means
they're cooler than I am,

00:07:03.939 --> 00:07:05.090
and I need that."

00:07:05.114 --> 00:07:06.804
And this is used in games as well.

00:07:06.828 --> 00:07:10.201
"Modern Warfare," one of the most
successful selling games of all time.

00:07:10.225 --> 00:07:13.226
I'm only a level four, but I desperately
want to be a level 10,

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:15.167
because they've got that cool red badge,

00:07:15.191 --> 00:07:17.976
and that means that I am somehow
better than everyone else.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.566
And that's very powerful to me.

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:21.699
Status is really good motivator.

00:07:21.723 --> 00:07:23.863
It's also used in more
conventional settings,

00:07:23.887 --> 00:07:25.768
and can be used more consciously there.

00:07:25.792 --> 00:07:28.745
School -- and remember,
I made it through one year,

00:07:28.769 --> 00:07:31.386
so I think I'm qualified
to talk on school --

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:34.513
is a game; it's just not a terribly
well-designed game.

00:07:34.537 --> 00:07:37.071
There are levels. There are C.
There are B. There's A.

00:07:37.095 --> 00:07:40.163
There are statuses. I mean,
what is valedictorian, but a status?

00:07:40.187 --> 00:07:44.567
If we called valedictorian
a "White Knight Paladin level 20,"

00:07:44.591 --> 00:07:46.848
I think people would probably
work a lot harder.

00:07:46.872 --> 00:07:48.872
(Laughter)

00:07:48.896 --> 00:07:50.075
(Applause)

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:52.336
So school is a game,

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.675
and there has been lots of experimentation
on how we do this properly.

00:07:55.699 --> 00:07:57.088
But let's use it consciously.

00:07:57.112 --> 00:08:00.365
Why have games you can lose?
Why go from an A to an F or a B to a C?

00:08:00.389 --> 00:08:01.912
That sucks. Why not level-up?

00:08:01.936 --> 00:08:04.491
At Princeton, they've actually
experimented with this,

00:08:04.515 --> 00:08:06.682
with quizzes where
you gain experience points,

00:08:06.706 --> 00:08:08.437
and you level up from B to an A.

00:08:08.461 --> 00:08:09.976
And it's very powerful.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.888
It can be used in interesting ways.

00:08:12.912 --> 00:08:15.626
The third one I'll talk about
is the progression dynamic,

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:18.557
where you have to make progress,
move through different steps

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:20.239
in a very granular fashion.

00:08:20.263 --> 00:08:22.976
This is used all over the place,
including LinkedIn,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.294
where I am an unwhole individual.

00:08:25.318 --> 00:08:28.598
I am only 85 percent complete on LinkedIn,

00:08:28.622 --> 00:08:29.976
and that bothers me.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.075
And this is so deep-seated in our psyche

00:08:33.099 --> 00:08:35.222
that when we're presented
with a progress bar

00:08:35.246 --> 00:08:37.786
and presented with easy,
granular steps to take

00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:40.397
to try and complete
that progress bar, we will do it.

00:08:40.421 --> 00:08:42.391
We will find a way to move that blue line

00:08:42.415 --> 00:08:44.580
all the way to the right edge
of the screen.

00:08:44.912 --> 00:08:47.048
This is used in conventional
games as well.

00:08:47.072 --> 00:08:49.265
I mean, this is a Paladin level 10,

00:08:49.289 --> 00:08:50.893
and that's a Paladin level 20.

00:08:50.917 --> 00:08:54.482
And if you were going to fight
Orcs on the fields of Mordor

00:08:54.506 --> 00:08:55.976
against the Ra's Al Ghul,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.286
you'd probably want to be
the bigger one, right?

00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:59.977
I would.

00:09:00.001 --> 00:09:02.512
And so people work very hard to level-up.

00:09:02.536 --> 00:09:05.766
"World of Warcraft" is one
of the most successful games of all time.

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:09.418
The average player spends some six,
six-and-a-half hours a day on it,

00:09:09.442 --> 00:09:13.040
their most dedicated players --
it's like a full-time job, it's insane.

00:09:13.064 --> 00:09:15.506
And they have these systems
where you can level-up.

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:18.310
And that's a very powerful thing.
Progression is powerful.

00:09:18.861 --> 00:09:21.876
It can also be used
in very compelling ways for good.

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.922
One of the things we work on at SCVNGR is:

00:09:23.946 --> 00:09:27.354
How do you use games to drive traffic
and business to local businesses,

00:09:27.378 --> 00:09:29.524
to something that is very key
to the economy?

00:09:29.548 --> 00:09:31.842
And here, we have a game that people play.

00:09:31.866 --> 00:09:33.890
They go places,
do challenges, earn points.

00:09:33.914 --> 00:09:36.498
And we've introduced
a progression dynamic into it,

00:09:36.522 --> 00:09:39.630
where, by going to the same place
over and over, doing challenges,

00:09:39.654 --> 00:09:40.948
engaging with the business,

00:09:40.972 --> 00:09:44.134
you move a green bar from the left edge
of the screen to the right,

00:09:44.158 --> 00:09:45.312
and unlock rewards.

00:09:45.336 --> 00:09:49.252
This is powerful enough that we can see
it hooks people into these dynamics,

00:09:49.276 --> 00:09:51.374
pulls them back to the same
local businesses,

00:09:51.398 --> 00:09:53.132
creates loyalty, creates engagement,

00:09:53.156 --> 00:09:57.083
and is able to drive meaningful revenue
and fun and engagement to businesses.

00:09:57.107 --> 00:10:00.976
These progression dynamics are powerful
and can be used in the real world.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.353
The final one I want to talk about --
and it's a great one to end on --

00:10:04.377 --> 00:10:06.234
is this concept of communal discovery,

00:10:06.258 --> 00:10:10.516
a dynamic in which everyone
has to work together to achieve something.

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:12.366
Communal discovery is powerful

00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:15.406
because it leverages
the network that is society

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:16.898
to solve problems.

00:10:17.811 --> 00:10:21.589
This is used in some famous
consumer web stories like Digg,

00:10:21.613 --> 00:10:23.298
which I'm sure you've all heard of.

00:10:23.322 --> 00:10:24.976
Digg is a communal dynamic

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.976
to try to find and source the best news,
the most interesting stories.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
And they made this into a game, initially.

00:10:31.024 --> 00:10:34.188
They had a leader board where,
if you recommended the best stories,

00:10:34.212 --> 00:10:35.564
you would get points.

00:10:35.588 --> 00:10:38.340
And that really motivated people
to find the best stories.

00:10:38.364 --> 00:10:40.976
But it became so powerful,
there was actually a cabal,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.399
a group of people, the top seven
on the leader board,

00:10:44.423 --> 00:10:47.602
who would work together to make sure
they maintained that position,

00:10:47.626 --> 00:10:49.071
recommending people's stories.

00:10:49.095 --> 00:10:51.308
The game became
more powerful than the goal.

00:10:51.332 --> 00:10:54.976
They ended up shutting down the leader
board because, while it was effective,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.904
it was so powerful that it stopped
sourcing the best stories,

00:10:57.928 --> 00:11:00.475
and started having people work
to maintain leadership.

00:11:00.499 --> 00:11:02.266
So we have to use this one carefully.

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:04.645
It's also used in things
like McDonald's Monopoly,

00:11:04.669 --> 00:11:07.058
where the game is not
the Monopoly you're playing,

00:11:07.082 --> 00:11:10.411
but the cottage industries
that form to try and find Boardwalk.

00:11:10.435 --> 00:11:13.649
There, they're just looking
for a sticker that says "Boardwalk,"

00:11:13.673 --> 00:11:15.731
but it can also be used
to find real things.

00:11:15.755 --> 00:11:17.488
This is the DARPA balloon challenge,

00:11:17.512 --> 00:11:20.853
where they hid a couple balloons
all across the United States and said,

00:11:20.877 --> 00:11:23.307
"Use networks. Try and find
these balloons fastest,

00:11:23.331 --> 00:11:24.977
and the winner will get $40,000."

00:11:25.001 --> 00:11:26.848
The winner was a group out of MIT,

00:11:26.872 --> 00:11:29.468
where they created sort
of a pyramid scheme, a network,

00:11:29.492 --> 00:11:32.921
where the first person to recommend
the location of a balloon got $2,000,

00:11:32.945 --> 00:11:35.876
and anyone else to push
that recommendation up also got a cut.

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.891
And in 12 hours, they were able
to find all these balloons,

00:11:38.915 --> 00:11:40.381
all across the country.

00:11:40.405 --> 00:11:42.129
Really powerful dynamic.

00:11:42.153 --> 00:11:44.976
And so, I've got about 20 seconds left,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.048
so if I'm going to leave
you with anything,

00:11:47.072 --> 00:11:48.854
last decade was the decade of social.

00:11:48.878 --> 00:11:50.976
This next decade is the decade of games.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.867
We use game dynamics to build on it.
We build with mindshare.

00:11:53.891 --> 00:11:55.136
We can influence behavior.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.023
It's very powerful. It's very exciting.

00:11:57.047 --> 00:12:00.404
Let's all build it together,
let's do it well and have fun playing.

00:12:00.428 --> 00:12:02.500
(Applause)
