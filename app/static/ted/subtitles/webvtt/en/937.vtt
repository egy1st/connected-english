00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
It feels like we're all suffering

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
from information overload or data glut.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And the good news is there might be an easy solution to that,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and that's using our eyes more.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So, visualizing information, so that we can see

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
the patterns and connections that matter

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and then designing that information so it makes more sense,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
or it tells a story,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
or allows us to focus only on the information that's important.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Failing that, visualized information can just look really cool.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So, let's see.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
This is the $Billion Dollar o-Gram,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and this image arose

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
out of frustration I had

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
with the reporting of billion-dollar amounts in the press.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
That is, they're meaningless without context:

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
500 billion for this pipeline,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
20 billion for this war.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
It doesn't make any sense, so the only way to understand it

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
is visually and relatively.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
So I scraped a load of reported figures

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
from various news outlets

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and then scaled the boxes according to those amounts.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And the colors here represent the motivation behind the money.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
So purple is "fighting,"

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and red is "giving money away," and green is "profiteering."

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And what you can see straight away

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
is you start to have a different relationship to the numbers.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
You can literally see them.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
But more importantly, you start to see

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
patterns and connections between numbers

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
that would otherwise be scattered across multiple news reports.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Let me point out some that I really like.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
This is OPEC's revenue, this green box here --

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
780 billion a year.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And this little pixel in the corner -- three billion --

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
that's their climate change fund.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Americans, incredibly generous people --

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
over 300 billion a year, donated to charity every year,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
compared with the amount of foreign aid

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
given by the top 17 industrialized nations

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
at 120 billion.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Then of course,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
the Iraq War, predicted to cost just 60 billion

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
back in 2003.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And it mushroomed slightly. Afghanistan and Iraq mushroomed now

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
to 3,000 billion.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
So now it's great

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
because now we have this texture, and we can add numbers to it as well.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
So we could say, well, a new figure comes out ... let's see African debt.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
How much of this diagram do you think might be taken up

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
by the debt that Africa owes to the West?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Let's take a look.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
So there it is:

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
227 billion is what Africa owes.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
And the recent financial crisis,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
how much of this diagram might that figure take up?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
What has that cost the world? Let's take a look at that.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Dooosh -- Which I think is the appropriate sound effect

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
for that much money:

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
11,900 billion.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So, by visualizing this information,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
we turned it into a landscape

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
that you can explore with your eyes,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
a kind of map really, a sort of information map.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And when you're lost in information,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
an information map is kind of useful.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
So I want to show you another landscape now.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
We need to imagine what a landscape

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
of the world's fears might look like.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Let's take a look.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
This is Mountains Out of Molehills,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
a timeline of global media panic.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
(Laughter)

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
So, I'll label this for you in a second.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
But the height here, I want to point out,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
is the intensity of certain fears

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
as reported in the media.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Let me point them out.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
So this, swine flu -- pink.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Bird flu.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
SARS -- brownish here. Remember that one?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
The millennium bug,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
terrible disaster.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
These little green peaks

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
are asteroid collisions.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
(Laughter)

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And in summer, here, killer wasps.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:38.000
(Laughter)

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
So these are what our fears look like

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
over time in our media.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
But what I love -- and I'm a journalist --

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and what I love is finding hidden patterns; I love being a data detective.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
And there's a very interesting and odd pattern hidden in this data

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
that you can only see when you visualize it.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Let me highlight it for you.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
See this line, this is a landscape for violent video games.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
As you can see, there's a kind of odd, regular pattern in the data,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
twin peaks every year.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
If we look closer, we see those peaks occur

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
at the same month every year.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Why?

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Well, November, Christmas video games come out,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
and there may well be an upsurge in the concern about their content.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
But April isn't a particularly massive month

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
for video games.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Why April?

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Well, in April 1999 was the Columbine shooting,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
and since then, that fear

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
has been remembered by the media

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
and echoes through the group mind gradually through the year.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
You have retrospectives, anniversaries,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
court cases, even copy-cat shootings,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
all pushing that fear into the agenda.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
And there's another pattern here as well. Can you spot it?

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
See that gap there? There's a gap,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
and it affects all the other stories.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Why is there a gap there?

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
You see where it starts? September 2001,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
when we had something very real

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
to be scared about.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
So, I've been working as a data journalist for about a year,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
and I keep hearing a phrase

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
all the time, which is this:

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
"Data is the new oil."

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Data is the kind of ubiquitous resource

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
that we can shape to provide new innovations and new insights,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
and it's all around us, and it can be mined very easily.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
It's not a particularly great metaphor in these times,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
especially if you live around the Gulf of Mexico,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
but I would, perhaps, adapt this metaphor slightly,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
and I would say that data is the new soil.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Because for me, it feels like a fertile, creative medium.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Over the years, online,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
we've laid down

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
a huge amount of information and data,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
and we irrigate it with networks and connectivity,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
and it's been worked and tilled by unpaid workers and governments.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
And, all right, I'm kind of milking the metaphor a little bit.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
But it's a really fertile medium,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
and it feels like visualizations, infographics, data visualizations,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
they feel like flowers blooming from this medium.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
But if you look at it directly,

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
it's just a lot of numbers and disconnected facts.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
But if you start working with it and playing with it in a certain way,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
interesting things can appear and different patterns can be revealed.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Let me show you this.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Can you guess what this data set is?

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
What rises twice a year,

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
once in Easter

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
and then two weeks before Christmas,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
has a mini peak every Monday,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
and then flattens out over the summer?

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
I'll take answers.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
(Audience: Chocolate.) David McCandless: Chocolate.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
You might want to get some chocolate in.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Any other guesses?

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
(Audience: Shopping.) DM: Shopping.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Yeah, retail therapy might help.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
(Audience: Sick leave.)

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
DM: Sick leave. Yeah, you'll definitely want to take some time off.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Shall we see?

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:46.000
(Laughter)

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
(Applause)

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
So, the information guru Lee Byron and myself,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
we scraped 10,000 status Facebook updates

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
for the phrase "break-up" and "broken-up"

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
and this is the pattern we found --

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
people clearing out for Spring Break,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000
(Laughter)

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
coming out of very bad weekends on a Monday,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
being single over the summer,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
and then the lowest day of the year, of course: Christmas Day.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Who would do that?

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
So there's a titanic amount of data out there now,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
unprecedented.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
But if you ask the right kind of question,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
or you work it in the right kind of way,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
interesting things can emerge.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
So information is beautiful. Data is beautiful.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
I wonder if I could make my life beautiful.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
And here's my visual C.V.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
I'm not quite sure I've succeeded.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Pretty blocky, the colors aren't that great.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
But I wanted to convey something to you.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
I started as a programmer,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
and then I worked as a writer for many years, about 20 years,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
in print, online and then in advertising,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
and only recently have I started designing.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And I've never been to design school.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
I've never studied art or anything.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
I just kind of learned through doing.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
And when I started designing,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
I discovered an odd thing about myself.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
I already knew how to design,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
but it wasn't like I was amazingly brilliant at it,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
but more like I was sensitive

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
to the ideas of grids and space

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
and alignment and typography.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
It's almost like being exposed

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
to all this media over the years

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
had instilled a kind of dormant design literacy in me.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
And I don't feel like I'm unique.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
I feel that everyday, all of us now

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
are being blasted by information design.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
It's being poured into our eyes through the Web,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
and we're all visualizers now;

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
we're all demanding a visual aspect

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
to our information.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
There's something almost quite magical about visual information.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
It's effortless, it literally pours in.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
And if you're navigating a dense information jungle,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
coming across a beautiful graphic

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
or a lovely data visualization,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
it's a relief, it's like coming across a clearing in the jungle.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
I was curious about this, so it led me

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
to the work of a Danish physicist

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
called Tor Norretranders,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
and he converted the bandwidth of the senses into computer terms.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
So here we go. This is your senses,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
pouring into your senses every second.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Your sense of sight is the fastest.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
It has the same bandwidth as a computer network.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Then you have touch, which is about the speed of a USB key.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
And then you have hearing and smell,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
which has the throughput of a hard disk.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
And then you have poor old taste,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
which is like barely the throughput of a pocket calculator.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
And that little square in the corner, a naught .7 percent,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
that's the amount we're actually aware of.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
So a lot of your vision --

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
the bulk of it is visual, and it's pouring in.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
It's unconscious.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
The eye is exquisitely sensitive

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
to patterns in variations in color, shape and pattern.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
It loves them, and it calls them beautiful.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
It's the language of the eye.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
If you combine the language of the eye with the language of the mind,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
which is about words and numbers and concepts,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
you start speaking two languages simultaneously,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
each enhancing the other.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
So, you have the eye, and then you drop in the concepts.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
And that whole thing -- it's two languages

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
both working at the same time.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
So we can use this new kind of language, if you like,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
to alter our perspective or change our views.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Let me ask you a simple question

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
with a really simple answer:

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Who has the biggest military budget?

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
It's got to be America, right?

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Massive. 609 billion in 2008 --

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
607, rather.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
So massive, in fact, that it can contain

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
all the other military budgets in the world inside itself.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Now, you can see Africa's total debt there

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
and the U.K. budget deficit for reference.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
So that might well chime

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
with your view that America

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
is a sort of warmongering military machine,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
out to overpower the world

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
with its huge industrial-military complex.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
But is it true that America has the biggest military budget?

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Because America is an incredibly rich country.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
In fact, it's so massively rich

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
that it can contain the four other

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
top industrialized nations' economies

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
inside itself, it's so vastly rich.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000
So its military budget is bound to be enormous.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
So, to be fair and to alter our perspective,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
we have to bring in another data set,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
and that data set is GDP, or the country's earnings.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Who has the biggest budget as a proportion of GDP?

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Let's have a look.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
That changes the picture considerably.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Other countries pop into view that you, perhaps, weren't considering,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
and American drops into eighth.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Now you can also do this with soldiers.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Who has the most soldiers? It's got to be China.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Of course, 2.1 million.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Again, chiming with your view

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
that China has a militarized regime

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
ready to, you know, mobilize its enormous forces.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
But of course, China has an enormous population.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
So if we do the same,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
we see a radically different picture.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
China drops to 124th.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
It actually has a tiny army

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
when you take other data into consideration.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
So, absolute figures, like the military budget,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
in a connected world,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
don't give you the whole picture.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
They're not as true as they could be.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
We need relative figures that are connected to other data

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
so that we can see a fuller picture,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
and then that can lead to us changing our perspective.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
As Hans Rosling, the master,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
my master, said,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
"Let the dataset change your mindset."

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
And if it can do that, maybe it can also change your behavior.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Take a look at this one.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
I'm a bit of a health nut.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
I love taking supplements and being fit,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
but I can never understand what's going on in terms of evidence.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
There's always conflicting evidence.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Should I take vitamin C? Should I be taking wheatgrass?

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
This is a visualization of all the evidence

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
for nutritional supplements.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
This kind of diagram is called a balloon race.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
So the higher up the image,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
the more evidence there is for each supplement.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.000
And the bubbles correspond to popularity as regards to Google hits.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
So you can immediately apprehend

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
the relationship between efficacy and popularity,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
but you can also, if you grade the evidence,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
do a "worth it" line.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
So supplements above this line are worth investigating,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
but only for the conditions listed below,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
and then the supplements below the line

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
are perhaps not worth investigating.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Now this image constitutes a huge amount of work.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
We scraped like 1,000 studies from PubMed,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
the biomedical database,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
and we compiled them and graded them all.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
And it was incredibly frustrating for me

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
because I had a book of 250 visualizations to do for my book,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
and I spent a month doing this,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
and I only filled two pages.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
But what it points to

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
is that visualizing information like this

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
is a form of knowledge compression.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
It's a way of squeezing an enormous amount

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
of information and understanding

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
into a small space.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
And once you've curated that data, and once you've cleaned that data,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
and once it's there,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
you can do cool stuff like this.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
So I converted this into an interactive app,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
so I can now generate this application online --

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
this is the visualization online --

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
and I can say, "Yeah, brilliant."

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
So it spawns itself.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
And then I can say, "Well, just show me the stuff

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
that affects heart health."

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
So let's filter that out.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
So heart is filtered out, so I can see if I'm curious about that.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
I think, "No, no. I don't want to take any synthetics,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000
I just want to see plants and --

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
just show me herbs and plants. I've got all the natural ingredients."

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Now this app is spawning itself

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
from the data.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
The data is all stored in a Google Doc,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
and it's literally generating itself from that data.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
So the data is now alive; this is a living image,

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
and I can update it in a second.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
New evidence comes out. I just change a row on a spreadsheet.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Doosh! Again, the image recreates itself.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
So it's cool.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
It's kind of living.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
But it can go beyond data,

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
and it can go beyond numbers.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
I like to apply information visualization

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
to ideas and concepts.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
This is a visualization

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
of the political spectrum,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
an attempt for me to try

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
and understand how it works

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
and how the ideas percolate down

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
from government into society and culture,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
into families, into individuals, into their beliefs

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
and back around again in a cycle.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
What I love about this image

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
is it's made up of concepts,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
it explores our worldviews

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
and it helps us -- it helps me anyway --

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
to see what others think,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
to see where they're coming from.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
And it feels just incredibly cool to do that.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
What was most exciting for me

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
designing this

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
was that, when I was designing this image,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
I desperately wanted this side, the left side,

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
to be better than the right side --

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
being a journalist, a Left-leaning person --

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
but I couldn't, because I would have created

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
a lopsided, biased diagram.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
So, in order to really create a full image,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
I had to honor the perspectives on the right-hand side

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
and at the same time, uncomfortably recognize

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
how many of those qualities were actually in me,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
which was very, very annoying and uncomfortable.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
(Laughter)

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
But not too uncomfortable,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
because there's something unthreatening

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
about seeing a political perspective,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
versus being told or forced to listen to one.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
You're capable of holding conflicting viewpoints

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
joyously when you can see them.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
It's even fun to engage with them

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
because it's visual.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
So that's what's exciting to me,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
seeing how data can change my perspective

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
and change my mind midstream --

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
beautiful, lovely data.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
So, just to wrap up,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
I wanted to say

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
that it feels to me that design is about solving problems

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
and providing elegant solutions,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
and information design is about

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
solving information problems.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
It feels like we have a lot of information problems

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
in our society at the moment,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
from the overload and the saturation

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
to the breakdown of trust and reliability

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
and runaway skepticism and lack of transparency,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
or even just interestingness.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
I mean, I find information just too interesting.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
It has a magnetic quality that draws me in.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
So, visualizing information

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
can give us a very quick solution to those kinds of problems.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Even when the information is terrible,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
the visual can be quite beautiful.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Often we can get clarity

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
or the answer to a simple question very quickly,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
like this one,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
the recent Icelandic volcano.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Which was emitting the most CO2?

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Was it the planes or the volcano,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
the grounded planes or the volcano?

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
So we can have a look.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
We look at the data and we see:

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Yep, the volcano emitted 150,000 tons;

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
the grounded planes would have emitted

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
345,000 if they were in the sky.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
So essentially, we had our first carbon-neutral volcano.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
(Laughter)

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:45.000
(Applause)

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
And that is beautiful. Thank you.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:56.000
(Applause)
