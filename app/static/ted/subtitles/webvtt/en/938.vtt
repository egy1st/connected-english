WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Come with me to the bottom of the world,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Antarctica,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
the highest, driest, windiest,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and yes, coldest region on Earth --

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
more arid than the Sahara

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and, in parts, colder than Mars.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The ice of Antarctica glows

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
with a light so dazzling,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
it blinds the unprotected eye.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Early explorers rubbed cocaine in their eyes

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
to kill the pain of it.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The weight of the ice is such that the entire continent

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
sags below sea level, beneath its weight.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Yet, the ice of Antarctica

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
is a calendar of climate change.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
It records the annual rise and fall

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
of greenhouse gases and temperatures

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
going back before the onset of the last ice ages.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Nowhere on Earth

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
offers us such a perfect record.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And here, scientists are drilling

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
into the past of our planet

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
to find clues to the future

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
of climate change.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
This past January,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I traveled to a place called WAIS Divide,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
about 600 miles from the South Pole.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
It is the best place on the planet, many say,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
to study the history of climate change.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
There, about 45 scientists from the University of Wisconsin,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
the Desert Research Institute in Nevada and others

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
have been working to answer a central question

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
about global warming.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
What is the exact relationship

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
between levels of greenhouse gases

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and planetary temperatures?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
It's urgent work. We know that temperatures are rising.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
This past May was the warmest worldwide on record.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And we know that levels of greenhouse gases are rising too.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
What we don't know

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
is the exact, precise, immediate

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
impact of these changes

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
on natural climate patterns --

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
winds, ocean currents,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
precipitation rates, cloud formation,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
things that bear on the health and well-being

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
of billions of people.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Their entire camp, every item of gear,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
was ferried 885 miles

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
from McMurdo Station,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
the main U.S. supply base

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
on the coast of Antarctica.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
WAIS Divide itself though,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
is a circle of tents in the snow.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
In blizzard winds, the crew sling ropes between the tents

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
so that people can feel their way safely

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
to the nearest ice house

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
and to the nearest outhouse.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
It snows so heavily there,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
the installation was almost immediately buried.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Indeed, the researchers picked this site

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
because ice and snow accumulates here

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
10 times faster than anywhere else in Antarctica.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
They have to dig themselves out every day.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
It makes for an exotic

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
and chilly commute.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
(Laughter)

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
But under the surface

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
is a hive of industrial activity

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
centered around an eight-million-dollar drill assembly.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Periodically, this drill, like a biopsy needle,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
plunges thousands of feet deep into the ice

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
to extract a marrow of gases

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and isotopes for analysis.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Ten times a day, they extract

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
the 10-foot long cylinder of compressed ice crystals

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
that contain the unsullied air and trace chemicals

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
laid down by snow,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
season after season for thousands of years.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
It's really a time machine.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
At the peak of activity earlier this year,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
the researchers lowered the drill

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
an extra hundred feet deeper into the ice every day

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
and another 365 years

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
deeper into the past.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Periodically, they remove

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
a cylinder of ice,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
like gamekeepers popping a spent shotgun shell

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
from the barrel of a drill.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
They inspect it, they check it for cracks,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
for drill damage, for spalls, for chips.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
More importantly,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
they prepare it for inspection and analysis

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
by 27 independent laboratories

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
in the United States and Europe,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
who will examine it for 40 different trace chemicals

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
related to climate,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
some in parts per quadrillion.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Yes, I said that with a Q, quadrillion.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
They cut the cylinders up into three-foot sections

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
for easier handling and shipment

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
back to these labs,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
some 8,000 miles from the drill site.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Each cylinder

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
is a parfait of time.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
This ice formed as snow

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
15,800 years ago,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
when our ancestors were daubing themselves with paint

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
and considering the radical new technology

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
of the alphabet.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Bathed in polarized light

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and cut in cross-section,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
this ancient ice reveals itself

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
as a mosaic of colors,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
each one showing how conditions at depth in the ice

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
have affected this material

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
at depths where pressures can reach

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
a ton per square inch.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Every year, it begins with a snowflake,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
and by digging into fresh snow,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
we can see how this process is ongoing today.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
This wall of undisturbed snow,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
back-lit by sunlight,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
shows the striations of winter and summer snow,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
layer upon layer.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Each storm scours the atmosphere,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
washing out dust, soot,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
trace chemicals,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
and depositing them on the snow pack

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
year after year,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
millennia after millennia,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
creating a kind of periodic table of elements

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
that at this point

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
is more than 11,000 feet thick.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
From this, we can detect an extraordinary number of things.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
We can see the calcium

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
from the world's deserts,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
soot from distant wildfires,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
methane as an indicator of the strength of a Pacific monsoon,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
all wafted on winds from warmer latitudes

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
to this remote and very cold place.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Most importantly,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
these cylinders and this snow

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
trap air.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Each cylinder is about 10 percent ancient air,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
a pristine time capsule

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
of greenhouse gases -- carbon dioxide,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
methane, nitrous oxide --

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
all unchanged from the day that snow formed

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
and first fell.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And this is the object of their scrutiny.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
But don't we already know

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
what we need to know about greenhouse gases?

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Why do we need to study this anymore?

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Don't we already know how they affect temperatures?

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Don't we already know the consequences

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
of a changing climate on our settled civilization?

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
The truth is, we only know the outlines,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
and what we don't completely understand,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
we can't properly fix.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Indeed, we run the risk of making things worse.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Consider, the single most successful

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
international environmental effort of the 20th century,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
the Montreal Protocol,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
in which the nations of Earth banded together to protect the planet

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
from the harmful effects of ozone-destroying chemicals

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
used at that time

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
in air conditioners, refrigerators and other cooling devices.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
We banned those chemicals,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
and we replaced them, unknowingly,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
with other substances

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
that, molecule per molecule,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
are a hundred times more potent

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
as heat-trapping, greenhouse gases

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
than carbon dioxide.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
This process requires

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
extraordinary precautions.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
The scientists must insure

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
that the ice is not contaminated.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Moreover, in this 8,000-mile journey,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
they have to insure this ice doesn't melt.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Imagine juggling a snowball across the tropics.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
They have to, in fact,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
make sure this ice never gets warmer

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
than about 20 degrees below zero,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
otherwise, the key gases inside it will dissipate.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
So, in the coldest place on Earth,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
they work inside a refrigerator.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
As they handle the ice, in fact,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
they keep an extra pair of gloves warming in an oven,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
so that, when their work gloves freeze

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
and their fingers stiffen,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
they can don a fresh pair.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
They work against the clock and against the thermometer.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
So far, they've packed up

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
about 4,500 feet of ice cores

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
for shipment back to the United States.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
This past season,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
they manhandled them across the ice

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
to waiting aircraft.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
The 109th Air National Guard

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
flew the most recent shipment of ice

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
back to the coast of Antarctica,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
where it was boarded onto a freighter,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
shipped across the tropics to California,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
unloaded, put on a truck,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
driven across the desert

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
to the National Ice Core Laboratory in Denver, Colorado,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
where, as we speak,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
scientists are now slicing this material up

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
for samples, for analysis,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
to be distributed

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
to the laboratories around the country

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
and in Europe.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Antarctica was this planet's

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
last empty quarter --

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
the blind spot

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
in our expanding vision of the world.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Early explorers

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
sailed off the edge of the map,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
and they found a place

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
where the normal rules of time and temperature

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
seem suspended.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Here, the ice seems a living presence.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
The wind that rubs against it

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
gives it voice.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
It is a voice of experience.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
It is a voice we should heed.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Thank you.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
(Applause)
