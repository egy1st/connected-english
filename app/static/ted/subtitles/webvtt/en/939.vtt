00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Cartoons are basically short stories.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I tried to find one that didn't have a whole lot of words.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Not all of them have happy endings.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So how did I get started cartooning?

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I doodled a lot as a kid,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and if you spend enough time doodling,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
sooner or later, something happens:

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
all your career options run out.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So you have to make a living cartooning.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Actually, I fell in love with the ocean when I was a little boy,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
when I was about eight or nine.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And I was particularly fascinated with sharks.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
This is some of my early work.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Eventually, my mom took the red crayon away,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
so it was [unclear].

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
But I'd like to relay to you a childhood experience of mine

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
that really made me see the ocean differently,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and it's become the foundation of my work

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
because, I feel like, if in a day,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I can see the ocean differently,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
then I can evoke that same kind of change in others,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
especially kids.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Before that day, this is how I saw the ocean.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
It's just a big blue surface.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And this is how we've seen the ocean since the beginning of time.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
It's a mystery.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
There's been a lot of folklore

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
developed around the ocean,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
mostly negative.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And that prompted people to make maps like this,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
with all kinds of wonderful detail on the land,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
but when you get to the waters edge,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
the ocean looks like one giant puddle of blue paint.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And this is the way I saw the ocean at school --

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
as if to say, "All geography and science lessons

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
stop at water's edge.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
This part's not going to be on the test."

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
But that day I flew low over the islands --

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
it was a family trip to the Caribbean,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and I flew in a small plane low over the islands.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
This is what I saw. I saw hills and valleys.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I saw forests and meadows.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I saw grottoes and secret gardens

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and places I'd love to hide as a kid,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
if I could only breathe underwater.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
And best of all, I saw the animals.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
I saw a manta ray that looked as big as the plane I was flying in.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And I flew over a lagoon with a shark in it,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and that was the day that my comic strip about a shark was born.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
So from that day on, I was an ordinary kid

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
walking around on dry land,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
but my head was down there, underwater.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Up until that day,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
these were the animals that were most common in my life.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
These were the ones I'd like to draw --

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
all variations of four legs and fur.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
But when you got to the ocean,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
my imagination was no competition for nature.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Every time I'd come up with a crazy cartoon character on the drawing board,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I'd find a critter in the ocean that was even crazier.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
And the differences in scale between this tiny sea dragon

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
and this enormous humpback whale

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
was like something out of a science-fiction movie.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Whenever I talk to kids, I always like to tell them,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
the biggest animal that ever lived is still alive.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
It's not a dinosaur; it's a whale,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
animals as big as office buildings

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
still swimming around out there in our ocean.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Speaking of dinosaurs, sharks are basically

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
the same fish they were 300 million years ago.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
So if you ever fantasize about going back in time

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and seeing what a dinosaur looked like,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
that's what a dinosaur looks like.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
So you have living dinosaurs

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and space aliens,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
animals that evolved in zero gravity in harsh conditions.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
It's just incredible; no Hollywood designer

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
could come up with something more interesting than that.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Or this fangtooth. The particles in the water

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
make it look like it's floating in outer space.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Could you image if we looked through the Hubble Telescope

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
and we saw that?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
It would start a whole new space race.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
But instead, we stick a camera in the deep ocean,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
and we see a fish, and it doesn't capture our imagination

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
as a society.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
We say to ourselves,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
"Maybe we can make fish sticks with it or something."

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
So, what I'd like to do now

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
is try a little drawing.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
So, I'm going to try to draw this fangtooth here.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
I love to draw the deep sea fish,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
because they are so ugly,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
but beautiful in their own way.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Maybe we can give him a little bioluminescence here --

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
give him a headlight,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
maybe a brake light,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
turn signals.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
But it's easy to see why these animals

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
make such great cartoon characters,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
their shapes and sizes.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
So some of them actually seem to have powers

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
like superheroes in a comic book.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
For instance,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
take these sea turtles.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
They kind of have a sixth sense

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
like Superman's x-ray vision.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
They can sense the magnetic fields of the earth.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
And they can use that sense

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
to navigate hundreds of miles of open ocean.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
I kind of give my turtle hands

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
just to make them an easier cartoon character to work with.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Or take this sea cucumber.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
It's not an animal we draw cartoons of

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
or draw at all.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
He's like an underwater Spiderman.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
He shoots out these sticky webs

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
to entangle his enemy.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Of course, sea cucumbers shoot them out their rears,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
which, in my opinion, makes them much more interesting a superhero.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
(Laughter)

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
He can't spin a web anytime; he's got to pull his pants down first.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
(Laughter)

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Or the blowfish.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
The blowfish is like the Incredible Hulk.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
It can change its body

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
into a big, intimidating fish

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
in a matter of seconds.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
I'm going to draw this blowfish uninflated.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
And then I'm going to attempt

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
onscreen animation here.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Let's see.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Try and inflate it.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
(Laughter)

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
"You talkin' to me?" See, he can inflate himself

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
when he wants to be intimidating.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Or take this swordfish.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Could you imagine being born with a tool for a nose?

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Do you think he wakes up in the morning, looks in the mirror and says,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
"Somebody's getting stabbed today."

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Or this lionfish for instance.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Imagine trying to make friends

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
covered with razor-sharp poisonous barbs.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
It's not something you want to put on your Facebook page, right?

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
My characters are --

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
my lead character's a shark named Sherman.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
He's a great white shark.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
And I kind of broke the mold with Sherman.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
I didn't want to go with this ruthless

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
predator image.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
He's kind of just out there making a living.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
He's sort of a Homer Simpson with fins.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And then his sidekick

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
is a sea turtle, as I mentioned before, named Filmore.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
He uses his wonderful skills at navigation

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
to wander the oceans, looking for a mate.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
And he does manage to find them,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
but great navigation skills, lousy pick-up lines.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
He never seems

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
to settle on

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
any particular girl.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
I have a hermit crab named Hawthorne,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
who doesn't get a lot of respect as a hermit crab,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
so he kind of wishes

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
he were a great white shark.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
And then I'll introduce you to one more character,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
this guy, Ernest,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
who is basically a juvenile delinquent

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
in a fish body.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
So with characters, you can make stories.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Sometimes making a story is as easy

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
as putting two characters in a room

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
and seeing what happens.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
So, imagine a great white shark and a giant squid in the same bathroom.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
(Laughter)

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Or, sometimes I take them to places

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
that people have never heard of because they're underwater.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
For instance, I took them skiing in the Mid-Atlantic Range,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
which is this range of mountains in the middle of the Atlantic.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
I've taken them to the Sea of Japan,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
where they met giant jellyfish.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
I've taken them camping in the kelp forests of California.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
This next one here,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
I did a story on the census of marine life.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
And that was a lot of fun because, as most of you know,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
it's a real project we've heard about.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
But it was a chance for me to introduce readers

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
to a lot of crazy undersea characters.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
So we start off the story with Ernest,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
who volunteers as a census taker.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
He goes down and he meets this famous anglerfish.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Then he meets the yeti crab,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
the famous vampire squid -- elusive, hard to find --

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
and the Dumbo octopus, which looks so much like a cartoon in real life

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
that really didn't have to change a thing when I drew it.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
I did another story on marine debris.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
I was speaking to a lot of my friends

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
in the conservation business,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
and they --

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
I asked them, "So what's one issue you would like everyone to know more about?"

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And they said -- this one friend of mine said,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
"I've got one word for you: plastic."

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
And I told him, "Well, I need something a little sexier than that.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Plastic just is not going to do it."

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
We sort of worked things out.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
He wanted me to use words like polyvinyl chloride,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
which doesn't really work in voice balloons very well.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
I couldn't fit them in.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
So what I did was I made an adventure strip.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Basically, this bottle travels a long way.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
What I'm trying to tell readers

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
is that plastic doesn't really go away;

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
it just continues to wash downstream.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
And a lot of it ends up washing into the ocean,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
which is a great story if you attach a couple characters to it,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
especially if they can't stand each other, like these two.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
So, I sent them to Boise, Idaho,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
where they dropped a plastic bottle

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
into the Boise sewer system.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
And it ended up in the Boise River

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
and then on to the Columbia River

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
and then to the mouth of the Columbia

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
and to the Pacific Ocean

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
and then on to this place called the Great Pacific Garbage Patch --

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
which is this giant Pacific gyre in the North Pacific,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
where a lot of this plastic ends up floating around --

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
and then back onto the lagoon.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
So that was basically a buddy story

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
with a plastic bottle following along.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
So a lot of people remember the plastic bottle anyway,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
but we really talked about marine debris and plastic

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
in the course of that one.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
The third storyline I did about a year and a half ago

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
was probably my most difficult.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
It was on shark finning, and I felt really strongly

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
about this issue.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
And I felt like, since my main character was a shark,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
the comic strip was a perfect vehicle for telling the public about this.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Now, finning is the act

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
of taking a shark, cutting the valuable fins off

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
and throwing the live animal back in the water.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
It's cruel, it's wasteful.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
There's nothing funny or entertaining about it,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
but I really wanted to take this issue on.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
I had to kill my main character, who is a shark.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
We start with Sherman in a Chinese restaurant,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
who gets a fortune that he's about to get caught by a trawler,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
which he does.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
And then he dies.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
He gets finned, and then he gets thrown overboard.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
Ostensibly, he's dead now.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
And so I killed a character that's been in the newspaper for 15 years.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
So I got a lot of reader feedback on that one.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Meanwhile, the other characters are talking about shark fin soup.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
I do three or four strips after that

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
where we explore the finning issue

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
and the shark fin soup issue.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Sherman's up in shark heaven.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
This is what I love about comic strips, you know.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
You really don't have to worry about the audience suspending its sense of disbelief

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
because, if you start with a talking shark,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
readers pretty much check their disbelief at the door.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
You can kind of do anything.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
It becomes a near-death experience for Sherman.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Meanwhile, Ernest finds his fins on the internet.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
There was a real website based in China

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
that actually sold shark fins,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
so I kind of exposed that.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
And he clicks the "buy now" button.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
And voila, next-day air, they show up,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
and they surgically reattach them.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
I ended that series with a kind of a mail-in petition

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
that encouraged our National Marine Fishery Service,

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
to force other countries

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
to have a stronger stance with shark management.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
(Applause)

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Thanks.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
I'd like to end with a little metaphor here.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
I've been trying to think of a metaphor to represent Mission Blue,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
and this is what I came up with.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Imagine you're in an enormous room,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
and it's as dark as a cave.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
And you can have anything in that room, anything you want,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
but you can't see anything.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
You've been given one tool, a hammer.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
So you wander around in the darkness, and you bump into something,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
and it feels like it's made of stone.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
It's big, it's heavy. You can't carry it away,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
so you bang it with your hammer, and you break off a piece.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
And you take the piece out into the daylight.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
And you see you have a beautiful piece of white alabaster.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
So you say to yourself, "Well, that's worth something."

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
So you go back into the room,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
and you break this thing to pieces, and you haul it away.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
And you find other things, and you break that up, and you haul those away.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
And you're getting all kinds of cool stuff.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
And you hear other people doing the same thing.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
So you get this sense of urgency,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
like you need to find as much stuff as possible as soon as possible.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
And then some yells, "Stop!"

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
And they turn up the lights.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
And you realize where you are; you're in the Louvre.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
And you've taken all this complexity and beauty,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
and you've turned it into a cheap commodity.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
And that's what we're doing with the ocean.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
And part of what Mission Blue is about

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
is yelling, "Stop!"

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
so that each of us --

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
explorer, scientist, cartoonist, singer, chef --

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
can turn up the lights in their own way.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
And that's what I hope my comic strip does in a small way.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
That's why I like what I do.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Thanks for listening.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
(Applause)
