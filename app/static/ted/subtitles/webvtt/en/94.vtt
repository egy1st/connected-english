WEBVTT

00:00:02.023 --> 00:00:04.642
It's wonderful to be back.

00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:07.368
I love this wonderful gathering.

00:00:07.392 --> 00:00:09.589
And you must be wondering, "What on earth?

00:00:09.613 --> 00:00:11.265
Have they put up the wrong slide?"

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:12.447
No, no.

00:00:13.426 --> 00:00:17.638
Look at this magnificent beast,

00:00:17.662 --> 00:00:21.166
and ask the question: Who designed it?

00:00:23.152 --> 00:00:27.062
This is TED; this is
Technology, Entertainment, Design,

00:00:27.086 --> 00:00:28.825
and there's a dairy cow.

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.210
It's a quite wonderfully designed animal.

00:00:33.104 --> 00:00:35.302
And I was thinking,
how do I introduce this?

00:00:35.326 --> 00:00:39.976
And I thought, well, maybe
that old doggerel by Joyce Kilmer,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.980
you know: "Poems are made by fools
like me, but only God can make a tree."

00:00:45.004 --> 00:00:47.668
And you might say,
"Well, God designed the cow."

00:00:47.692 --> 00:00:49.795
But, of course, God got a lot of help.

00:00:51.525 --> 00:00:53.834
This is the ancestor of cattle.

00:00:53.858 --> 00:00:55.032
This is the aurochs.

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:58.760
And it was designed by natural selection,

00:00:58.784 --> 00:01:02.211
the process of natural selection,
over many millions of years.

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.663
And then it became domesticated,
thousands of years ago.

00:01:07.274 --> 00:01:11.923
And human beings became its stewards,

00:01:11.947 --> 00:01:14.177
and, without even knowing
what they were doing,

00:01:14.201 --> 00:01:18.497
they gradually redesigned it
and redesigned it and redesigned it.

00:01:18.521 --> 00:01:24.759
And then more recently, they really began
to do reverse engineering on this beast

00:01:24.783 --> 00:01:27.554
and figure out just what
the parts were, how they worked

00:01:27.578 --> 00:01:31.000
and how they might be optimized --
how they might be made better.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.696
Now, why am I talking about cows?

00:01:36.181 --> 00:01:40.181
Because I want to say that
much the same thing is true of religions.

00:01:41.489 --> 00:01:45.688
Religions are natural phenomena --
they're just as natural as cows.

00:01:46.862 --> 00:01:50.454
They have evolved over millennia.

00:01:51.438 --> 00:01:55.149
They have a biological base,
just like the aurochs.

00:01:55.798 --> 00:01:57.866
They have become domesticated,

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.217
and human beings have been redesigning
their religions for thousands of years.

00:02:04.138 --> 00:02:07.976
This is TED, and I want
to talk about design.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.913
Because what I've been doing
for the last four years --

00:02:10.937 --> 00:02:12.957
really since the first time you saw me --

00:02:12.981 --> 00:02:15.984
some of you saw me at TED
when I was talking about religion --

00:02:16.008 --> 00:02:17.501
and in the last four years,

00:02:17.525 --> 00:02:20.548
I've been working
just about non-stop on this topic.

00:02:20.961 --> 00:02:25.479
And you might say it's about
the reverse engineering of religions.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.153
Now that very idea, I think,
strikes terror in many people,

00:02:32.177 --> 00:02:36.777
or anger, or anxiety
of one sort or another.

00:02:37.743 --> 00:02:40.170
And that is the spell
that I want to break.

00:02:40.194 --> 00:02:43.909
I want to say, no, religions
are an important natural phenomenon.

00:02:43.933 --> 00:02:47.181
We should study them
with the same intensity

00:02:47.205 --> 00:02:50.372
that we study all the other
important natural phenomena,

00:02:50.396 --> 00:02:53.976
like global warming, as we heard
so eloquently last night from Al Gore.

00:02:55.128 --> 00:02:58.976
Today's religions are brilliantly
designed -- brilliantly designed.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.953
They are immensely powerful
social institutions

00:03:03.977 --> 00:03:09.257
and many of their features
can be traced back to earlier features

00:03:09.281 --> 00:03:12.540
that we can really make sense of
by reverse engineering.

00:03:14.333 --> 00:03:19.705
And, as with the cow, there's a mixture
of evolutionary design --

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:21.698
designed by natural selection itself --

00:03:21.722 --> 00:03:24.829
and intelligent design --

00:03:24.853 --> 00:03:26.667
more or less intelligent design --

00:03:26.691 --> 00:03:28.389
and redesigned by human beings

00:03:28.413 --> 00:03:31.293
who are trying
to redesign their religions.

00:03:32.564 --> 00:03:36.144
You don't do book talks at TED,

00:03:36.168 --> 00:03:40.292
but I'm going to have
just one slide about my book,

00:03:40.316 --> 00:03:42.989
because there is one message in it

00:03:43.013 --> 00:03:45.177
which I think this group
really needs to hear.

00:03:45.201 --> 00:03:48.733
And I would be very interested
to get your responses to this.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.695
It's the one policy proposal
that I make in the book,

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:58.082
at this time, when I claim
not to know enough about religion

00:03:58.106 --> 00:04:00.725
to know what other
policy proposals to make.

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:05.297
And it's one that echoes remarks
that you've heard already today.

00:04:05.321 --> 00:04:06.480
Here's my proposal,

00:04:06.504 --> 00:04:09.434
I'm going to just take a couple
of minutes to explain it:

00:04:09.458 --> 00:04:15.002
Education on world religions
for all of our children --

00:04:15.026 --> 00:04:17.169
in primary school, in high school,

00:04:17.193 --> 00:04:20.458
in public schools, in private schools
and in home schooling.

00:04:21.521 --> 00:04:23.179
So what I'm proposing is,

00:04:23.203 --> 00:04:29.063
just as we require reading, writing,
arithmetic, American history,

00:04:29.087 --> 00:04:36.087
so we should have a curriculum on facts
about all the religions of the world --

00:04:36.111 --> 00:04:40.976
about their history,
about their creeds, about their texts,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.661
their music, their symbolisms,
their prohibitions, their requirements.

00:04:46.994 --> 00:04:51.813
And this should be presented
factually, straightforwardly,

00:04:51.837 --> 00:04:57.301
with no particular spin,
to all of the children in the country.

00:04:58.507 --> 00:05:01.800
And as long as you teach them that,

00:05:01.824 --> 00:05:03.976
you can teach them anything else you like.

00:05:04.713 --> 00:05:08.705
That, I think, is maximal tolerance
for religious freedom.

00:05:09.363 --> 00:05:13.976
As long as you inform your children
about other religions,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.146
then you may -- and as early as you like
and whatever you like --

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:20.369
teach them whatever creed
you want them to learn.

00:05:20.956 --> 00:05:23.592
But also let them know
about other religions.

00:05:23.616 --> 00:05:26.000
Now, why do I say that?

00:05:27.365 --> 00:05:33.171
Because democracy depends
on an informed citizenship.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:40.000
Informed consent is the very bedrock
of our understanding of democracy.

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.976
Misinformed consent is not worth it.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.223
It's like a coin flip;
it doesn't count, really.

00:05:48.247 --> 00:05:50.976
Democracy depends on informed consent.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.333
This is the way we treat people
as responsible adults.

00:05:56.812 --> 00:06:03.550
Now, children below the age of consent
are a special case.

00:06:05.608 --> 00:06:11.199
Parents -- I'm going to use a word
that Pastor Rick just used --

00:06:11.223 --> 00:06:13.365
parents are stewards of their children.

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:15.484
They don't own them.

00:06:16.286 --> 00:06:18.188
You can't own your children.

00:06:18.212 --> 00:06:21.895
You have a responsibility to the world,

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:25.660
to the state, to them,
to take care of them right.

00:06:27.843 --> 00:06:33.890
You may teach them whatever creed
you think is most important,

00:06:33.914 --> 00:06:38.740
but I say you have a responsibility
to let them be informed

00:06:38.764 --> 00:06:41.296
about all the other creeds
in the world, too.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.468
The reason I've taken this time
is I've been fascinated to hear

00:06:46.492 --> 00:06:48.000
some of the reactions to this.

00:06:49.663 --> 00:06:54.779
One reviewer for a Roman Catholic
newspaper called it "totalitarian."

00:06:56.849 --> 00:07:00.000
It strikes me as practically libertarian.

00:07:01.071 --> 00:07:04.094
Is it totalitarian to require
reading, writing and arithmetic?

00:07:04.118 --> 00:07:05.277
I don't think so.

00:07:05.301 --> 00:07:07.280
All I'm saying is --

00:07:07.304 --> 00:07:13.228
and facts, facts only;
no values, just facts --

00:07:13.252 --> 00:07:15.000
about all the world's religions.

00:07:16.683 --> 00:07:18.606
Another reviewer called it "hilarious."

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:23.557
Well, I'm really bothered by the fact

00:07:23.581 --> 00:07:26.200
that anybody would think
that was hilarious.

00:07:26.224 --> 00:07:30.205
It seems to me to be such a plausible,

00:07:30.229 --> 00:07:34.625
natural extension of the democratic
principles we already have

00:07:34.649 --> 00:07:39.669
that I'm shocked to think anybody
would find that just ridiculous.

00:07:40.002 --> 00:07:43.519
I know many religions

00:07:43.543 --> 00:07:50.180
are so anxious about preserving the purity
of their faith among their children

00:07:50.204 --> 00:07:55.692
that they are intent on keeping
their children ignorant of other faiths.

00:07:57.145 --> 00:07:58.994
I don't think that's defensible.

00:08:00.184 --> 00:08:02.818
But I'd really be pleased
to get your answers on that --

00:08:02.842 --> 00:08:04.369
any reactions to that -- later.

00:08:04.393 --> 00:08:05.858
But now I'm going to move on.

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:07.976
Back to the cow.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.364
This picture, which I pulled
off the web --

00:08:11.388 --> 00:08:14.693
the fellow on the left is really
an important part of this picture.

00:08:14.717 --> 00:08:15.976
That's the steward.

00:08:16.305 --> 00:08:21.814
Cows couldn't live without human
stewards -- they're domesticated.

00:08:21.838 --> 00:08:24.576
They're a sort of ectosymbiont.

00:08:25.132 --> 00:08:29.774
They depend on us for their survival.

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.723
And Pastor Rick
was just talking about sheep.

00:08:33.747 --> 00:08:35.446
I'm going to talk about sheep, too.

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:38.453
There's a lot of serendipitous
convergence here.

00:08:39.007 --> 00:08:42.916
How clever it was of sheep
to acquire shepherds!

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:45.273
(Laughter)

00:08:45.297 --> 00:08:47.082
Think of what this got them.

00:08:47.438 --> 00:08:49.976
They could outsource all their problems:

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.611
protection from predators,
food-finding ...

00:08:52.635 --> 00:08:53.642
(Laughter)

00:08:53.666 --> 00:08:55.001
... health maintenance.

00:08:55.025 --> 00:08:56.918
(Laughter)

00:08:57.712 --> 00:09:02.500
The only cost in most flocks --
not even this -- a loss of free mating.

00:09:04.665 --> 00:09:05.831
What a deal!

00:09:06.673 --> 00:09:08.549
"How clever of sheep!" you might say.

00:09:08.573 --> 00:09:11.074
Except, of course,
it wasn't the sheep's cleverness.

00:09:11.098 --> 00:09:15.487
We all know sheep are not exactly rocket
scientists -- they're not very smart.

00:09:16.427 --> 00:09:18.550
It wasn't the cleverness
of the sheep at all.

00:09:18.574 --> 00:09:19.976
They were clueless.

00:09:21.201 --> 00:09:23.135
But it was a very clever move.

00:09:23.159 --> 00:09:24.482
Whose clever move was it?

00:09:24.506 --> 00:09:27.976
It was the clever move
of natural selection itself.

00:09:28.818 --> 00:09:34.601
Francis Crick, the co-discoverer
of the structure of DNA

00:09:34.625 --> 00:09:36.388
with Jim Watson,

00:09:36.412 --> 00:09:39.229
once joked about what he called
Orgel's Second Rule.

00:09:39.578 --> 00:09:44.829
Leslie Orgel is a molecular
biologist, brilliant guy,

00:09:44.853 --> 00:09:46.223
and Orgel's Second Rule is:

00:09:46.247 --> 00:09:48.024
Evolution is cleverer than you are.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:55.363
Now, that is not Intelligent Design --
not from Francis Crick.

00:09:56.479 --> 00:09:58.170
Evolution is cleverer than you are.

00:09:58.194 --> 00:10:01.328
If you understand Orgel's Second Rule,
then you understand

00:10:01.352 --> 00:10:06.255
why the Intelligent Design movement
is basically a hoax.

00:10:08.216 --> 00:10:12.630
The designs discovered
by the process of natural selection

00:10:12.654 --> 00:10:15.034
are brilliant, unbelievably brilliant.

00:10:15.058 --> 00:10:19.976
Again and again biologists are fascinated
with the brilliance of what's discovered.

00:10:20.283 --> 00:10:23.448
But the process itself is without purpose,

00:10:23.472 --> 00:10:25.647
without foresight, without design.

00:10:26.358 --> 00:10:27.889
When I was here four years ago,

00:10:27.913 --> 00:10:30.834
I told the story about an ant
climbing a blade of grass.

00:10:30.858 --> 00:10:34.724
And why the ant was doing it
was because its brain had been infected

00:10:34.748 --> 00:10:39.920
with a lancet fluke that was needed
to get into the belly of a sheep or a cow

00:10:39.944 --> 00:10:42.318
in order to reproduce.

00:10:42.342 --> 00:10:43.976
So it was sort of a spooky story.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.746
And I think some people
may have misunderstood.

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:48.374
Lancet flukes aren't smart.

00:10:48.874 --> 00:10:53.108
I submit that the intelligence
of a lancet fluke is down there,

00:10:53.132 --> 00:10:55.312
somewhere between petunia and carrot.

00:10:55.336 --> 00:10:57.638
They're not really bright.
They don't have to be.

00:10:57.662 --> 00:10:59.249
The lesson we learn from this is:

00:10:59.273 --> 00:11:01.976
you don't have to have a mind
to be a beneficiary.

00:11:02.797 --> 00:11:07.289
The design is there in nature,
but it's not in anybody's head.

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:08.976
It doesn't have to be.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.683
That's the way evolution works.

00:11:11.635 --> 00:11:13.762
Question: Was domestication
good for sheep?

00:11:14.223 --> 00:11:16.270
It was great for their genetic fitness.

00:11:16.294 --> 00:11:18.976
And here I want to remind you
of a wonderful point

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.976
that Paul MacCready made
at TED three years ago.

00:11:22.997 --> 00:11:24.155
Here's what he said:

00:11:25.012 --> 00:11:27.643
"Ten thousand years ago,
at the dawn of agriculture,

00:11:27.667 --> 00:11:30.079
human population, plus livestock and pets,

00:11:30.103 --> 00:11:35.210
was approximately a tenth of one percent
of the terrestrial vertebrate landmass."

00:11:35.519 --> 00:11:37.377
That was just 10,000 years ago.

00:11:38.234 --> 00:11:40.278
Yesterday, in biological terms.

00:11:40.708 --> 00:11:43.484
What is it today? Does anybody
remember what he told us?

00:11:44.167 --> 00:11:46.210
98 percent.

00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:49.432
That is what we have done on this planet.

00:11:49.456 --> 00:11:52.525
Now, I talked to Paul afterwards --
I wanted to check to find out

00:11:52.549 --> 00:11:55.422
how he'd calculated this, and get
the sources and so forth --

00:11:55.446 --> 00:11:58.145
and he also gave me a paper
that he had written on this.

00:11:58.169 --> 00:12:00.991
And there was a passage in it
which he did not present here

00:12:01.015 --> 00:12:03.610
and I think it is so good,
I'm going to read it to you:

00:12:03.634 --> 00:12:06.774
"Over billions of years
on a unique sphere,

00:12:06.798 --> 00:12:09.639
chance has painted
a thin covering of life:

00:12:09.663 --> 00:12:13.026
complex, improbable,
wonderful and fragile.

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:15.976
Suddenly, we humans --
a recently arrived species

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.448
no longer subject to the checks
and balances inherent in nature --

00:12:19.472 --> 00:12:22.290
have grown in population,
technology and intelligence

00:12:22.314 --> 00:12:24.257
to a position of terrible power.

00:12:24.281 --> 00:12:26.152
We now wield the paintbrush."

00:12:27.358 --> 00:12:30.747
We heard about the atmosphere
as a thin layer of varnish.

00:12:30.771 --> 00:12:33.976
Life itself is just a thin coat
of paint on this planet.

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:36.910
And we're the ones
that hold the paintbrush.

00:12:37.576 --> 00:12:38.837
And how can we do that?

00:12:39.179 --> 00:12:42.373
The key to our domination
of the planet is culture.

00:12:43.557 --> 00:12:45.585
And the key to culture is religion.

00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:49.220
Suppose Martian scientists came to Earth.

00:12:49.958 --> 00:12:52.000
They would be puzzled by many things.

00:12:53.683 --> 00:12:56.397
Anybody know what this is?
I'll tell you what it is.

00:12:57.562 --> 00:13:02.855
This is a million people gathering
on the banks of the Ganges in 2001,

00:13:02.879 --> 00:13:06.341
perhaps the largest single gathering
of human beings ever,

00:13:06.365 --> 00:13:08.166
as seen from satellite photograph.

00:13:08.597 --> 00:13:09.749
Here's a big crowd.

00:13:09.773 --> 00:13:11.573
Here's another crowd in Mecca.

00:13:12.153 --> 00:13:14.961
Martians would be amazed by this.

00:13:14.985 --> 00:13:16.807
They'd want to know how it originated,

00:13:16.831 --> 00:13:19.418
what it was for
and how it perpetuates itself.

00:13:20.061 --> 00:13:22.386
Actually, I'm going to pass over this.

00:13:23.156 --> 00:13:24.411
The ant isn't alone.

00:13:24.435 --> 00:13:29.784
There's all sorts of wonderful cases
of species which -- in that case --

00:13:31.617 --> 00:13:35.323
A parasite gets into a mouse
and needs to get into the belly of a cat.

00:13:35.347 --> 00:13:38.208
And it turns the mouse
into Mighty Mouse, makes it fearless,

00:13:38.232 --> 00:13:41.015
so it runs out in the open,
where it'll be eaten by a cat.

00:13:41.039 --> 00:13:42.706
True story.

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:44.742
In other words, we have these hijackers --

00:13:44.766 --> 00:13:47.250
you've seen this slide before,
from four years ago --

00:13:47.274 --> 00:13:51.160
a parasite that infects the brain
and induces even suicidal behavior,

00:13:51.184 --> 00:13:54.423
on behalf of a cause
other than one's own genetic fitness.

00:13:55.314 --> 00:13:56.935
Does that ever happen to us?

00:13:57.562 --> 00:14:00.324
Yes, it does -- quite wonderfully.

00:14:02.102 --> 00:14:04.109
The Arabic word "Islam"
means "submission."

00:14:04.133 --> 00:14:07.149
It means "surrender of self-interest
to the will of Allah."

00:14:07.617 --> 00:14:09.400
But I'm not just talking about Islam.

00:14:09.424 --> 00:14:11.573
I'm talking also about Christianity.

00:14:11.597 --> 00:14:14.935
This is a parchment music page
that I found in a Paris bookstall

00:14:14.959 --> 00:14:16.227
50 years ago.

00:14:16.251 --> 00:14:18.000
And on it, it says, in Latin:

00:14:19.528 --> 00:14:22.488
"Semen est verbum Dei.
Sator autem Christus."

00:14:22.512 --> 00:14:25.976
The word of God is the seed
and the sower of the seed is Christ.

00:14:26.418 --> 00:14:28.263
Same idea. Well, not quite.

00:14:28.621 --> 00:14:33.273
But in fact, Christians, too ...

00:14:33.297 --> 00:14:36.932
glory in the fact
that they have surrendered to God.

00:14:36.956 --> 00:14:38.304
I'll give you a few quotes.

00:14:38.328 --> 00:14:40.162
"The heart of worship is surrender.

00:14:41.173 --> 00:14:45.167
Surrendered people obey God's words,
even if it doesn't make sense."

00:14:46.182 --> 00:14:48.366
Those words are by Rick Warren.

00:14:48.802 --> 00:14:51.278
Those are from "The Purpose Driven Life."

00:14:51.898 --> 00:14:55.524
And I want to turn now, briefly,
to talk about that book, which I've read.

00:14:55.548 --> 00:14:56.891
You've all got a copy,

00:14:56.915 --> 00:14:59.107
and you've just heard the man.

00:14:59.131 --> 00:15:02.838
And what I want to do now
is say a bit about this book

00:15:02.862 --> 00:15:04.297
from the design standpoint,

00:15:04.321 --> 00:15:06.615
because I think it's actually
a brilliant book.

00:15:08.369 --> 00:15:11.584
First of all, the goal -- and you
heard just now what the goal is --

00:15:11.608 --> 00:15:14.919
it's to bring purpose to the lives
of millions, and he has succeeded.

00:15:14.943 --> 00:15:18.715
Is it a good goal? In itself, I'm sure
we all agree, it is a wonderful goal.

00:15:18.739 --> 00:15:19.890
He's absolutely right.

00:15:19.914 --> 00:15:23.722
There are lots of people out there
who don't have purpose in their life,

00:15:23.746 --> 00:15:26.556
and bringing purpose to their life
is a wonderful goal.

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:28.172
I give him an A+ on this.

00:15:28.196 --> 00:15:30.020
(Laughter)

00:15:30.044 --> 00:15:31.647
Is the goal achieved?

00:15:33.822 --> 00:15:34.976
Yes.

00:15:36.266 --> 00:15:39.000
Thirty million copies of this book.

00:15:40.519 --> 00:15:41.976
Al Gore, eat your heart out.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.657
(Laughter)

00:15:45.681 --> 00:15:49.302
Just exactly what Al is trying
to do, Rick is doing.

00:15:49.326 --> 00:15:52.267
This is a fantastic achievement.

00:15:53.028 --> 00:15:56.143
And the means -- how does he do it?

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.976
It's a brilliant redesign
of traditional religious themes --

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.301
updating them, quietly dropping
obsolete features,

00:16:03.325 --> 00:16:05.483
putting new interpretations
on other features.

00:16:05.507 --> 00:16:09.198
This is the evolution of religion that's
been going on for thousands of years,

00:16:09.222 --> 00:16:12.015
and he's just the latest
brilliant practitioner of it.

00:16:13.833 --> 00:16:16.389
I don't have to tell you this;
you just heard the man.

00:16:16.413 --> 00:16:20.976
Excellent insights into human psychology,
wise advice on every page.

00:16:22.079 --> 00:16:25.407
Moreover, he invites us
to look under the hood.

00:16:25.431 --> 00:16:26.780
I really appreciated that.

00:16:26.804 --> 00:16:29.248
For instance, he has an appendix
where he explains

00:16:29.272 --> 00:16:32.332
his choice of translations
of different Bible verses.

00:16:32.999 --> 00:16:38.000
The book is clear, vivid, accessible,
beautifully formatted.

00:16:39.323 --> 00:16:40.976
Just enough repetition.

00:16:41.528 --> 00:16:42.814
That's really important.

00:16:43.568 --> 00:16:47.260
Every time you read it or say it,
you make another copy in your brain.

00:16:48.871 --> 00:16:52.616
Every time you read it or say it,
you make another copy in your brain.

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:53.648
(Laughter)

00:16:53.672 --> 00:16:54.916
With me, everybody --

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:57.916
(Audience and Dan Dennett)
Every time you read it or say it,

00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:00.241
you make another copy in your brain.

00:17:00.265 --> 00:17:01.426
Thank you.

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:03.743
And now we come to my problem.

00:17:03.767 --> 00:17:06.976
Because I'm absolutely sincere
in my appreciation

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.976
of all that I said about this book.

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.218
But I wish it were better.

00:17:11.242 --> 00:17:13.178
I have some problems with the book.

00:17:13.202 --> 00:17:16.981
And it would just be insincere of me
not to address those problems.

00:17:17.346 --> 00:17:21.109
I wish he could do this with a revision,

00:17:21.133 --> 00:17:23.564
a Mark 2 version of his book.

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:27.116
"The truth will set you free."

00:17:27.536 --> 00:17:29.443
That's what it says in the Bible,

00:17:29.467 --> 00:17:31.975
and it's something
that I want to live by, too.

00:17:32.418 --> 00:17:37.081
My problem is, some of the bits in it
I don't think are true.

00:17:37.748 --> 00:17:40.459
Now some of this
is a difference of opinion.

00:17:42.173 --> 00:17:45.038
And that's not my main complaint,
that's worth mentioning.

00:17:45.062 --> 00:17:48.251
Here's a passage -- it's very much
what he said, anyway:

00:17:48.275 --> 00:17:50.774
"If there was no God
we would all be accidents,

00:17:50.798 --> 00:17:53.909
the result of astronomical
random chance in the Universe.

00:17:53.933 --> 00:17:57.311
You could stop reading this book
because life would have no purpose

00:17:57.335 --> 00:17:58.819
or meaning or significance.

00:17:58.843 --> 00:18:00.425
There would be no right or wrong

00:18:00.449 --> 00:18:02.595
and no hope beyond
your brief years on Earth."

00:18:02.619 --> 00:18:04.528
Now, I just do not believe that.

00:18:04.552 --> 00:18:10.732
By the way, I find -- Homer Groening's
film presented a beautiful alternative

00:18:10.756 --> 00:18:12.097
to that very claim.

00:18:12.861 --> 00:18:16.266
Yes, there is meaning and a reason
for right or wrong.

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:22.524
We don't need a belief in God
to be good or to have meaning in us.

00:18:22.548 --> 00:18:26.809
But that, as I said,
is just a difference of opinion.

00:18:26.833 --> 00:18:28.976
That's not what I'm really worried about.

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:32.579
How about this: "God designed
this planet's environment

00:18:32.603 --> 00:18:34.110
just so we could live in it."

00:18:35.213 --> 00:18:39.655
I'm afraid that a lot of people
take that sentiment to mean

00:18:39.679 --> 00:18:42.299
that we don't have to do
the sorts of things

00:18:42.323 --> 00:18:44.711
that Al Gore is trying so hard
to get us to do.

00:18:44.735 --> 00:18:46.976
I am not happy with that sentiment at all.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.572
And then I find this: "All the evidence
available in the biological sciences

00:18:51.596 --> 00:18:55.280
supports the core proposition that
the cosmos is a specially designed whole

00:18:55.304 --> 00:18:58.583
with life and mankind
as its fundamental goal and purpose,

00:18:58.607 --> 00:19:01.291
a whole in which all facets
of reality have their meaning

00:19:01.315 --> 00:19:03.332
and explanation in this central fact."

00:19:03.356 --> 00:19:05.615
Well, that's Michael Denton.
He's a creationist.

00:19:06.833 --> 00:19:09.976
And here, I think, "Wait a minute."
I read this again.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.039
I read it three or four times and I think,

00:19:12.063 --> 00:19:14.607
"Is he really endorsing
Intelligent Design?

00:19:14.631 --> 00:19:16.618
Is he endorsing creationism here?"

00:19:16.642 --> 00:19:17.877
And you can't tell.

00:19:17.901 --> 00:19:20.006
So I'm sort of thinking,
"Well, I don't know,

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:22.427
I don't know if I want
to get upset with this yet."

00:19:22.451 --> 00:19:26.535
But then I read on, and I read this:
"First, Noah had never seen rain,

00:19:26.559 --> 00:19:30.416
because prior to the Flood, God irrigated
the earth from the ground up."

00:19:31.614 --> 00:19:35.976
I wish that sentence weren't in there,
because I think it is false.

00:19:36.537 --> 00:19:39.704
And I think that thinking this way
about the history of the planet,

00:19:39.728 --> 00:19:43.451
after we've just been hearing
about the history of the planet

00:19:43.475 --> 00:19:46.607
over millions of years,

00:19:46.631 --> 00:19:49.818
discourages people
from scientific understanding.

00:19:49.842 --> 00:19:56.387
Now, Rick Warren uses scientific terms

00:19:56.411 --> 00:20:00.517
and scientific factoids and information
in a very interesting way.

00:20:00.541 --> 00:20:03.905
Here's one: "God deliberately shaped
and formed you to serve him

00:20:03.929 --> 00:20:05.974
in a way that makes your ministry unique.

00:20:05.998 --> 00:20:09.641
He carefully mixed the DNA cocktail
that created you."

00:20:12.808 --> 00:20:14.976
I think that's false.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.698
Now, maybe we want to treat it
as metaphorical.

00:20:18.618 --> 00:20:22.197
Here's another one: "For instance,
your brain can store 100 trillion facts.

00:20:22.221 --> 00:20:25.266
Your mind can handle
15,000 decisions a second."

00:20:25.964 --> 00:20:28.638
Well, it would be interesting
to find the interpretation

00:20:28.662 --> 00:20:30.043
where I would accept that.

00:20:30.067 --> 00:20:32.733
There might be some way
of treating that as true.

00:20:33.511 --> 00:20:36.819
"Anthropologists have noted
that worship is a universal urge,

00:20:36.843 --> 00:20:39.498
hardwired by God into
the very fiber of our being --

00:20:39.522 --> 00:20:42.411
an inbuilt need to connect with God."

00:20:43.392 --> 00:20:45.560
Well, the sense of which I agree with him,

00:20:45.584 --> 00:20:47.964
except I think it has
an evolutionary explanation.

00:20:47.988 --> 00:20:51.809
And what I find
deeply troubling in this book

00:20:51.833 --> 00:20:55.586
is that he seems to be arguing
that if you want to be moral,

00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:57.779
if you want to have meaning in your life,

00:20:57.803 --> 00:21:00.270
you have to be an Intelligent Designer,

00:21:00.294 --> 00:21:03.815
you have to deny the theory of evolution
by natural selection.

00:21:03.839 --> 00:21:05.318
And I think, on the contrary,

00:21:05.342 --> 00:21:08.283
that it is very important
to solving the world's problems

00:21:08.307 --> 00:21:11.167
that we take evolutionary
biology seriously.

00:21:12.427 --> 00:21:14.338
Whose truth are we going to listen to?

00:21:15.649 --> 00:21:18.201
Well, this is from
"The Purpose Driven Life":

00:21:18.225 --> 00:21:21.518
"The Bible must become
the authoritative standard for my life:

00:21:21.542 --> 00:21:23.281
the compass I rely on for direction,

00:21:23.305 --> 00:21:26.122
the counsel I listen to
for making wise decisions,

00:21:26.146 --> 00:21:28.553
and the benchmark I use
for evaluating everything."

00:21:29.458 --> 00:21:33.845
Well maybe, OK, but what's going
to follow from this?

00:21:33.869 --> 00:21:36.011
And here's one that does concern me.

00:21:37.463 --> 00:21:39.816
Remember I quoted him
before with this line:

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:43.637
"Surrendered people obey God's word,
even if it doesn't make sense."

00:21:45.335 --> 00:21:48.139
And that's a problem.

00:21:49.843 --> 00:21:50.843
(Sighs)

00:21:50.867 --> 00:21:52.511
"Don't ever argue with the Devil.

00:21:52.535 --> 00:21:54.266
He's better at arguing than you are,

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:56.676
having had thousands
of years to practice."

00:21:56.700 --> 00:22:00.927
Now, Rick Warren
didn't invent this clever move.

00:22:00.951 --> 00:22:02.141
It's an old move.

00:22:02.649 --> 00:22:05.200
It's a very clever
adaptation of religions.

00:22:05.224 --> 00:22:08.820
It's a wild card for disarming
any reasonable criticism.

00:22:10.546 --> 00:22:12.268
"You don't like my interpretation?

00:22:12.292 --> 00:22:14.244
You've got a reasonable objection to it?

00:22:14.268 --> 00:22:15.764
Don't listen, don't listen!

00:22:16.321 --> 00:22:18.000
That's the Devil speaking."

00:22:19.185 --> 00:22:24.786
This discourages the sort
of reasoning citizenship

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:26.862
it seems to me that we want to have.

00:22:27.668 --> 00:22:29.976
I've got one more problem,
then I'm through.

00:22:30.298 --> 00:22:34.605
And I'd really like to get
a response if Rick is able to do it.

00:22:35.593 --> 00:22:37.372
"In the Great Commission, Jesus said,

00:22:37.396 --> 00:22:40.258
'Go to all people of all nations
and make them my disciples.

00:22:40.282 --> 00:22:43.497
Baptize them in the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit,

00:22:43.521 --> 00:22:45.788
and teach them to do
everything I've told you.'"

00:22:45.812 --> 00:22:49.128
The Bible says Jesus is the only one
who can save the world.

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:53.976
We've seen many wonderful maps
of the world in the last day or so.

00:22:54.297 --> 00:22:56.623
Here's one, not as beautiful
as the others;

00:22:56.647 --> 00:22:58.976
it simply shows
the religions of the world.

00:23:00.066 --> 00:23:03.976
Here's one that shows the sort of current
breakdown of the different religions.

00:23:07.099 --> 00:23:11.609
Do we really want to commit ourselves

00:23:11.633 --> 00:23:16.553
to engulfing all the other religions,

00:23:16.577 --> 00:23:19.943
when their holy books are telling them,

00:23:19.967 --> 00:23:24.426
"Don't listen to the other side,
that's just Satan talking!"?

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:30.787
It seems to me that
that's a very problematic ship

00:23:30.811 --> 00:23:32.976
to get on for the future.

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:37.976
I found this sign as I was driving
to Maine recently,

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.667
in front of a church:
"Good without God becomes zero."

00:23:40.691 --> 00:23:41.864
Sort of cute.

00:23:42.205 --> 00:23:44.254
A very clever little meme.

00:23:46.589 --> 00:23:52.193
I don't believe it and I think this idea,
popular as it is --

00:23:52.217 --> 00:23:54.308
not in this guise, but in general --

00:23:54.332 --> 00:23:57.585
is itself one of the main
problems that we face.

00:23:57.609 --> 00:24:04.280
If you are like me, you know
many wonderful, committed, engaged

00:24:04.304 --> 00:24:09.976
atheists, agnostics, who are being
very good without God.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.705
And you also know many religious people
who hide behind their sanctity

00:24:15.729 --> 00:24:17.498
instead of doing good works.

00:24:17.959 --> 00:24:21.554
So, I wish we could drop this meme.

00:24:21.578 --> 00:24:23.571
I wish this meme would go extinct.

00:24:23.595 --> 00:24:25.342
Thanks very much for your attention.

00:24:25.366 --> 00:24:27.900
(Applause)
