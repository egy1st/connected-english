00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So I'm going to talk to you about you about the political chemistry of oil spills

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and why this is an incredibly important,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
long, oily, hot summer,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and why we need to keep ourselves from getting distracted.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
But before I talk about the political chemistry,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I actually need to talk about the chemistry of oil.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
This is a photograph from when I visited

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Prudhoe Bay in Alaska in 2002

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
to watch the Minerals Management Service

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
testing their ability

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
to burn oil spills in ice.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And what you see here is, you see a little bit of crude oil,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
you see some ice cubes,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
and you see two sandwich baggies of napalm.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The napalm is burning there quite nicely.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And the thing is, is that

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
oil is really an abstraction for us as the American consumer.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
We're four percent of the world's population;

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
we use 25 percent of the world's oil production.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And we don't really understand what oil is,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
until you check out its molecules,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And you don't really understand that until you see this stuff burn.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So this is what happens as that burn gets going.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
It takes off. It's a big woosh.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I highly recommend that you get a chance to see crude oil burn someday,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
because you will never need to hear another poli sci lecture

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
on the geopolitics of oil again.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
It'll just bake your retinas.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
So there it is; the retinas are baking.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Let me tell you a little bit about this chemistry of oil.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Oil is a stew of hydrocarbon molecules.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
It starts of with the very small ones,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
which are one carbon, four hydrogen --

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
that's methane -- it just floats off.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Then there's all sorts of intermediate ones with middle amounts of carbon.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
You've probably heard of benzene rings; they're very carcinogenic.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And it goes all the way over

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
to these big, thick, galumphy ones that have hundreds of carbons,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and they have thousands of hydrogens,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and they have vanadium and heavy metals and sulfur

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and all kinds of craziness hanging off the sides of them.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Those are called the asphaltenes; they're an ingredient in asphalt.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
They're very important in oil spills.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Let me tell you a little bit about

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
the chemistry of oil in water.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
It is this chemistry that makes oil so disastrous.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Oil doesn't sink, it floats.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
If it sank, it would be a whole different story as far as an oil spill.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
And the other thing it does is it spreads out the moment it hits the water.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
It spreads out to be really thin,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
so you have a hard time corralling it.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
The next thing that happens

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
is the light ends evaporate,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and some of the toxic things float into the water column

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and kill fish eggs

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and smaller fish and things like that, and shrimp.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And then the asphaltenes -- and this is the crucial thing --

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
the asphaltenes get whipped by the waves

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
into a frothy emulsion, something like mayonnaise.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
It triples the amount

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
of oily, messy goo that you have in the water,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and it makes it very hard to handle.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
It also makes it very viscous.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
When the Prestige sank off the coast of Spain,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
there were big, floating cushions the size of sofa cushions

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
of emulsified oil,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
with the consistency, or the viscosity, of chewing gum.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
It's incredibly hard to clean up.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And every single oil is different when it hits water.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
When the chemistry of the oil and water

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
also hits our politics,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
it's absolutely explosive.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
For the first time, American consumers

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
will kind of see the oil supply chain in front of themselves.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
They have a "eureka!" moment,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
when we suddenly understand oil in a different context.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
So I'm going to talk just a little bit about the origin of these politics,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
because it's really crucial to understanding

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
why this summer is so important, why we need to stay focused.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Nobody gets up in the morning and thinks,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
"Wow! I'm going to go buy

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
some three-carbon-to-12-carbon molecules to put in my tank

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
and drive happily to work."

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
No, they think, "Ugh. I have to go buy gas.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
I'm so angry about it. The oil companies are ripping me off.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
They set the prices, and I don't even know.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I am helpless over this."

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And this is what happens to us at the gas pump --

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and actually, gas pumps are specifically designed

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
to diffuse that anger.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
You might notice that many gas pumps, including this one,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
are designed to look like ATMs.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
I've talked to engineers. That's specifically to diffuse our anger,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
because supposedly we feel good about ATMs.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
(Laughter)

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
That shows you how bad it is.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
But actually, I mean, this feeling of helplessness

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
comes in because most Americans actually feel

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
that oil prices are the result of a conspiracy,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
not of the vicissitudes of the world oil market.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
And the thing is, too,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
is that we also feel very helpless about the amount that we consume,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
which is somewhat reasonable,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
because in fact, we have designed this system

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
where, if you want to get a job,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
it's much more important to have a car that runs,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
to have a job and keep a job, than to have a GED.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
And that's actually very perverse.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Now there's another perverse thing about the way we buy gas,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
which is that we'd rather be doing anything else.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
This is BP's gas station

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
in downtown Los Angeles.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
It is green. It is a shrine to greenishness.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
"Now," you think, "why would something so lame

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
work on people so smart?"

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Well, the reason is, is because, when we're buying gas,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
we're very invested in this sort of cognitive dissonance.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
I mean, we're angry at the one hand and we want to be somewhere else.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
We don't want to be buying oil;

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
we want to be doing something green.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
And we get kind of in on our own con.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
I mean -- and this is funny,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
it looks funny here.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
But in fact, that's why the slogan "beyond petroleum" worked.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
But it's an inherent part of our energy policy,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
which is we don't talk about

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
reducing the amount of oil that we use.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
We talk about energy independence. We talk about hydrogen cars.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
We talk about biofuels that haven't been invented yet.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
And so, cognitive dissonance

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
is part and parcel of the way that we deal with oil,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
and it's really important to dealing with this oil spill.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Okay, so the politics of oil

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
are very moral in the United States.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
The oil industry is like a huge, gigantic octopus

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
of engineering and finance

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
and everything else,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
but we actually see it in very moral terms.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
This is an early-on photograph -- you can see, we had these gushers.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Early journalists looked at these spills,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
and they said, "This is a filthy industry."

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
But they also saw in it

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
that people were getting rich for doing nothing.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
They weren't farmers, they were just getting rich for stuff coming out of the ground.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
It's the "Beverly Hillbillies," basically.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
But in the beginning, this was seen as a very morally problematic thing,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
long before it became funny.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
And then, of course, there was John D. Rockefeller.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And the thing about John D. is that

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
he went into this chaotic wild-east

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
of oil industry,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
and he rationalized it

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
into a vertically integrated company, a multinational.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
It was terrifying; you think Walmart is a terrifying business model now,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
imagine what this looked like in the 1860s or 1870s.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
And it also the kind of root

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
of how we see oil as a conspiracy.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
But what's really amazing is that

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Ida Tarbell, the journalist,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
went in and did a big exposé of Rockefeller

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and actually got the whole antitrust laws

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
put in place.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
But in many ways,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
that image of the conspiracy still sticks with us.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And here's one of the things

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
that Ida Tarbell said --

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
she said, "He has a thin nose like a thorn.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
There were no lips.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
There were puffs under the little colorless eyes

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
with creases running from them."

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
(Laughter)

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Okay, so that guy is actually still with us.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
(Laughter)

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
I mean, this is a very pervasive -- this is part of our DNA.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
And then there's this guy, okay.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
So, you might be wondering why it is that,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
every time we have high oil prices or an oil spill,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
we call these CEOs down to Washington,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
and we sort of pepper them with questions in public and we try to shame them.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
And this is something that we've been doing since 1974,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
when we first asked them, "Why are there these obscene profits?"

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
And we've sort of personalized the whole oil industry

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
into these CEOs.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
And we take it as, you know --

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
we look at it on a moral level,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
rather than looking at it on a legal and financial level.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
And so I'm not saying these guys aren't liable to answer questions --

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
I'm just saying that, when you focus on

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
whether they are or are not a bunch of greedy bastards,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
you don't actually get around to the point

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
of making laws that are either going to either change the way they operate,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
or you're going to get around

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
to really reducing the amount of oil

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
and reducing our dependence on oil.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
So I'm saying this is kind of a distraction.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
But it makes for good theater,

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
and it's powerfully cathartic as you probably saw last week.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
So the thing about water oil spills

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
is that they are very politically galvanizing.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
I mean, these pictures -- this is from the Santa Barbara spill.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
You have these pictures of birds.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
They really influence people.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
When the Santa Barbara spill happened in 1969,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
it formed the environmental movement in its modern form.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
It started Earth Day.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
It also put in place the National Environmental Policy Act,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Everything that we are really stemmed from this period.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
I think it's important to kind of look at these pictures of the birds

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
and understand what happens to us.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Here we are normally;

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
we're standing at the gas pump, and we're feeling kind of helpless.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
We look at these pictures

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
and we understand, for the first time, our role in this supply chain.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
We connect the dots in the supply chain.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
And we have this kind of --

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
as voters, we have kind of a "eureka!" moment.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
This is why these moments of these oil spills

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
are so important.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
But it's also really important that we don't get distracted

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
by the theater or the morals of it.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
We actually need to go in

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
and work on the roots of the problem.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
One of the things that happened with the two previous oil spills

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
was that we really worked on some of the symptoms.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
We were very reactive, as opposed to being proactive

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
about what happened.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
And so what we did was, actually,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
we made moratoriums on the east and west coasts on drilling.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
We stopped drilling in ANWR,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
but we didn't actually reduce the amount of oil that we consumed.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
In fact, it's continued to increase.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
The only thing that really reduces the amount of oil that we consume

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
is much higher prices.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
As you can see, our own production has fallen off

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
as our reservoirs have gotten old and expensive to drill out.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
We only have two percent of the world's oil reserves;

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
65 percent of them are in the Persian Gulf.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
One of the things that's happened because of this

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
is that, since 1969,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
the country of Nigeria, or the part of Nigeria that pumps oil,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
which is the delta -- which is two times the size of Maryland --

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
has had thousands of oil spills a year.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
I mean, we've essentially been exporting oil spills

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
when we import oil from places

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
without tight environmental regulations.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
That has been the equivalent of an Exxon Valdez spill

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
every year since 1969.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
And we can wrap our heads around the spills,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
because that's what we see here,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
but in fact, these guys actually live in a war zone.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
There's a thousand battle-related deaths a year

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
in this area twice the size of Maryland,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
and it's all related to the oil.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
And these guys, I mean, if they were in the U.S.,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
they might be actually here in this room.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
They have degrees in political science, degrees in business --

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
they're entrepreneurs. They don't actually want to be doing what they're doing.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
And it's sort of one of the other groups of people

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
who pay a price for us.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
The other thing that we've done,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
as we've continued to increase demand,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
is that we kind of play a shell game with the costs.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
One of the places we put in a big oil project

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
in Chad, with Exxon.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
So the U.S. taxpayer paid for it;

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
the World Bank, Exxon paid for it.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
We put it in. There was a tremendous banditry problem.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
I was there in 2003.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
We were driving along this dark, dark road,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
and the guy in the green stepped out,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
and I was just like, "Ahhh! This is it."

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
And then the guy in the Exxon uniform stepped out,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
and we realized it was okay.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
They have their own private sort of army around them at the oil fields.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
But at the same time,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Chad has become much more unstable,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
and we are not paying for that price at the pump.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
We pay for it in our taxes on April 15th.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
We do the same thing

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
with the price of policing the Persian Gulf

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
and keeping the shipping lanes open.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
This is 1988 --

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
we actually bombed two Iranian oil platforms that year.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
That was the beginning of an escalating U.S. involvement there

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
that we do not pay for at the pump.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
We pay for it on April 15th,

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
and we can't even calculate the cost of this involvement.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
The other place that is sort of supporting our dependence on oil

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
and our increased consumption

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
is the Gulf of Mexico,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
which was not part of the moratoriums.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Now what's happened in the Gulf of Mexico -- as you can see,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
this is the Minerals Management diagram

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
of wells for gas and oil.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
It's become this intense industrialized zone.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
It doesn't have the same resonance for us

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
that the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
but it should, I mean, it's a bird sanctuary.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Also, every time you buy gasoline in the United States,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
half of it is actually being refined along the coast,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
because the Gulf actually has

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
about 50 percent of our refining capacity

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
and a lot of our marine terminals as well.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
So the people of the Gulf have essentially been subsidizing the rest of us

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
through a less-clean environment.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
And finally, American families also pay a price for oil.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Now on the one hand, the price at the pump is not really very high

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
when you consider the actual cost of the oil,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
but on the other hand,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
the fact that people have no other transit options

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
means that they pay a large amount of their income

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
into just getting back and forth to work,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
generally in a fairly crummy car.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
If you look at people who make $50,000 a year, they have two kids,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
they might have three jobs or more,

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
and then they have to really commute.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
They're actually spending more on their car and fuel

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
than they are on taxes or on health care.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
And the same thing happens

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
at the 50th percentile, around 80,000.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Gasoline costs are a tremendous drain

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
on the American economy,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
but they're also a drain on individual families

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
and it's kind of terrifying to think about what happens when prices get higher.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
So, what I'm going to talk to you about now is:

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
what do we have to do this time?

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
What are the laws? What do we have to do to keep ourselves focused?

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
One thing is -- we need to stay away from the theater.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
We need to stay away from the moratoriums.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
We need to focus really back again

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
on the molecules.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
The moratoriums are fine, but we do need to focus

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
on the molecules on the oil.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
One of the things that we also need to do,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
is we need to try to not kind of fool ourselves

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
into thinking that you can have a green world,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
before you reduce the amount of oil that we use.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
We need to focus on reducing the oil.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
What you see in this top drawing is a schematic

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
of how petroleum gets used in the U.S. economy.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
It comes in on the side -- the useful stuff is the dark gray,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
and the un-useful stuff,

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
which is called the rejected energy -- the waste,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
goes up to the top.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Now you can see that the waste far outweighs

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
the actually useful amount.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
And one of the things that we need to do

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
is, not only fix the fuel efficiency of our vehicles

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
and make them much more efficient,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
but we also need to fix the economy in general.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
We need to remove the perverse incentives to use more fuel.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
For example, we have an insurance system

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
where the person who drives 20,000 miles a year

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
pays the same insurance as somebody who drives 3,000.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
We actually encourage people to drive more.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
We have policies that reward sprawl -- we have all kinds of policies.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
We need to have more mobility choices.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
We need to make the gas price

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
better reflect the real cost of oil.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
And we need to shift subsidies from the oil industry,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
which is at least 10 billion dollars a year,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
into something that allows middle-class people to find better ways to commute.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Whether that's getting a much more efficient car

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
and also kind of building markets

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
for new cars and new fuels down the road,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
this is where we need to be.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
We need to kind of rationalize this whole thing,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
and you can find more about this policy.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
It's called STRONG, which is "Secure Transportation

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Reducing Oil Needs Gradually,"

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
and the idea is instead of being helpless, we need to be more strong.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
They're up at NewAmerica.net.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
What's important about these

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
is that we try to move

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
from feeling helpless at the pump,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
to actually being active

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
and to really sort of thinking about who we are,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
having kind of that special moment,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
where we connect the dots actually at the pump.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Now supposedly, oil taxes

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
are the third rail of American politics -- the no-fly zone.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
I actually -- I agree that a dollar a gallon on oil

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
is probably too much,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
but I think that if we started this year

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
with three cents a gallon on gasoline,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
and upped it to six cents next year, nine cents the following year,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
all the way up to 30 cents by 2020,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
that we could actually significantly reduce our gasoline consumption,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
and at the same time we would give people time to prepare,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
time to respond,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
and we would be raising money and raising consciousness at the same time.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Let me give you a little sense of how this would work.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
This is a gas receipt, hypothetically, for a year from now.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
The first thing that you have on the tax is --

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
you have a tax for a stronger America -- 33 cents.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
So you're not helpless at the pump.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
And the second thing that you have is a kind of warning sign,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
very similar to what you would find

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
on a cigarette pack.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
And what it says is, "The National Academy of Sciences

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
estimates that every gallon of gas you burn in your car

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
creates 29 cents in health care costs."

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
That's a lot.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
And so this -- you can see that you're paying considerably less

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
than the health care costs on the tax.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
And also, the hope is that

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
you start to be connected to the whole greater system.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
And at the same time, you have a number that you can call

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
to get more information on commuting,

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
or a low-interest loan on a different kind of car,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
or whatever it is you're going to need

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
to actually reduce your gasoline dependence.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
With this whole sort of suite of policies,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
we could actually reduce our gasoline consumption --

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
or our oil consumption --

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
by 20 percent by 2020.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
So, three million barrels a day.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
But in order to do this,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
one of the things we really need to do, is we need to remember

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
we are people of the hydrocarbon.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
We need to keep or minds on the molecules

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
and not get distracted by the theater,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
not get distracted by the cognitive dissonance

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
of the green possibilities that are out there.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
We need to kind of get down and do the gritty work

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
of reducing our dependence upon this fuel and these molecules.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
Thank you.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
(Applause)
