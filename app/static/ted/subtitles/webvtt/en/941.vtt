00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So I work in marketing, which I love,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
but my first passion was physics,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
a passion brought to me by a wonderful school teacher,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
when I had a little less gray hair.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
So he taught me

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that physics is cool

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
because it teaches us so much about the world around us.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And I'm going to spend the next few minutes trying to convince you

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
that physics can teach us something about marketing.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So quick show of hands --

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
who studied some marketing in university?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Who studied some physics in university?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Pretty good. And at school?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Okay, lots of you.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So, hopefully this will bring back some happy,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
or possibly some slightly disturbing memories.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So, physics and marketing.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We'll start with something very simple -- Newton's Law:

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
"The force equals mass times acceleration."

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
This is something that perhaps Turkish Airlines

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
should have studied a bit more carefully

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
before they ran this campaign.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
(Laughter)

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
But if we rearrange this formula quickly,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
we can get to acceleration equals force over mass,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
which means

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
that for a larger particle -- a larger mass --

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
it requires more force to change its direction.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
It's the same with brands:

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
the more massive a brand, the more baggage it has,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
the more force is needed to change its positioning.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And that's one of the reasons why

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Arthur Andersen chose to launch Accenture

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
rather than try to persuade the world

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
that Andersen's could stand for something

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
other than accountancy.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
It explains why Hoover

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
found it very difficult to persuade the world

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
that it was more than vacuum cleaners,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and why companies like Unilever and P&amp;G

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
keep brands separate,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
like Ariel and Pringles and Dove

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
rather than having one giant parent brand.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So the physics is that the bigger the mass of an object

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
the more force is needed

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
to change its direction.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
The marketing is, the bigger a brand,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
the more difficult it is to reposition it.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
So think about a portfolio of brands

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
or maybe new brands for new ventures.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Now, who remembers Heisenberg's uncertainty principle?

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Getting a little more technical now.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
So this says that

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
it's impossible, by definition,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
to measure exactly the state -- i.e., the position --

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
and the momentum of a particle,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
because the act of measuring it, by definition, changes it.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
So to explain that -- if you've got an elementary particle

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and you shine a light on it,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
then the photon of light has momentum,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
which knocks the particle,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
so you don't know where it was before you looked at it.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
By measuring it,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
the act of measurement changes it.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
The act of observation changes it.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
It's the same in marketing.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
So with the act of observing consumers, changes their behavior.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Think about the group of moms

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
who are talking about their wonderful children in a focus group,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and almost none of them buy lots of junk food.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And yet, McDonald's sells hundreds of millions of burgers every year.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Think about the people who are on accompanied shops in supermarkets,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
who stuff their trolleys

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
full of fresh green vegetables and fruit,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
but don't shop like that any other day.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And if you think about the number of people

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
who claim in surveys

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
to regularly look for porn on the Web,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
it's very few.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Yet, at Google, we know it's the number-one searched for category.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
So luckily, the science --

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
no, sorry -- the marketing is getting easier.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Luckily, with now better point-of-sale tracking,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
more digital media consumption,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
you can measure more what consumers actually do,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
rather than what they say they do.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
So the physics is

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
you can never accurately and exactly

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
measure a particle,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
because the observation changes it.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
The marketing is -- the message for marketing is --

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
that try to measure what consumers actually do,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
rather than what they say they'll do

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
or anticipate they'll do.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
So next, the scientific method --

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
an axiom of physics, of all science --

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
says you cannot prove a hypothesis through observation,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
you can only disprove it.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
What this means is you can gather more and more data

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
around a hypothesis or a positioning,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
and it will strengthen it, but it will not conclusively prove it.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
And only one contrary data point

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
can blow your theory out of the water.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
So if we take an example --

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Ptolemy had dozens of data points to support his theory

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
that the planets would rotate around the Earth.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
It only took one robust observation from Copernicus

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
to blow that idea out of the water.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
And there are parallels for marketing --

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
you can invest for a long time in a brand,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
but a single contrary observation of that positioning

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
will destroy consumers' belief.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Take BP --

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
they spent millions of pounds over many years

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
building up its credentials as an environmentally friendly brand,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
but then one little accident.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Think about Toyota.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
It was, for a long time, revered

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
as the most reliable of cars,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
and then they had the big recall incident.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
And Tiger Woods, for a long time,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
the perfect brand ambassador.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Well, you know the story.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000
(Laughter)

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
So the physics is

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
that you cannot prove a hypothesis,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
but it's easy to disprove it --

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
any hypothesis is shaky.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And the marketing is

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
that not matter how much you've invested in your brand,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
one bad week can undermine decades of good work.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
So be really careful to try and avoid the screw-ups

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
that can undermine your brand.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And lastly, to the slightly obscure world of entropy --

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
the second law of thermodynamics.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
This says that entropy,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
which is a measure of the disorder of a system,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
will always increase.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
The same is true of marketing.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
If we go back 20 years,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
the one message pretty much controlled by one marketing manager

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
could pretty much define a brand.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
But where we are today, things have changed.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
You can get a strong brand image

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
or a message

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
and put it out there like the Conservative Party did

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
earlier this year with their election poster.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
But then you lose control of it.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
With the kind of digital comment creation and distribution tools

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
that are available now to every consumer,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
it's impossible to control where it goes.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Your brand starts being dispersed,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
(Laughter)

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
it gets more chaotic.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
(Laughter)

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
It's out of your control.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
(Laughter)

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
I actually saw him speak -- he did a good job.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
But while this may be unsettling for marketers,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
it's actually a good thing.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
This distribution of brand energy

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
gets your brand closer to the people,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
more in with the people.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
It makes this distribution of energy a democratizing force,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
which is ultimately good for your brand.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
So, the lesson from physics is

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
that entropy will always increase; it's a fundamental law.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
The message for marketing is that your brand is more dispersed.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
You can't fight it, so embrace it

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
and find a way to work with it.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
So to close,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
my teacher, Mr. Vutter, told me

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
that physics is cool,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
and hopefully, I've convinced you

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
that physics can teach all of us, even in the world of marketing, something special.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Thank you.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
(Applause)
