00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Martin Luther King

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
did not say,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
"I have a nightmare,"

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
when he inspired the civil rights movements.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
He said, "I have a dream."

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And I have a dream.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I have a dream that we can stop thinking

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
that the future will be a nightmare,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and this is going to be a challenge,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
because, if you think

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
of every major blockbusting film of recent times,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
nearly all of its visions for humanity

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
are apocalyptic.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I think this film

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
is one of the hardest watches of modern times, "The Road."

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
It's a beautiful piece of filmmaking,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
but everything is desolate,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
everything is dead.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And just a father and son

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
trying to survive, walking along the road.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And I think the environmental movement

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
of which I am a part of

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
has been complicit

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
in creating this vision of the future.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
For too long,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
we have peddled a nightmarish vision

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
of what's going to happen.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
We have focused on the worst-case scenario.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
We have focused on the problems.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And we have not thought enough

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
about the solutions.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
We've used fear, if you like,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
to grab people's attention.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And any psychologist will tell you

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
that fear in the organism

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
is linked to flight mechanism.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
It's part of the fight and flight mechanism,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
that when an animal is frightened --

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
think of a deer.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
A deer freezes very, very still,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
poised to run away.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And I think that's what we're doing

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
when we're asking people to engage with our agenda

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
around environmental degradation and climate change.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
People are freezing and running away

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
because we're using fear.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And I think the environmental movement has to grow up

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and start to think about

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
what progress is.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
What would it be like to be improving the human lot?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And one of the problems that we face, I think,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
is that the only people that have cornered the market

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
in terms of progress

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
is a financial definition of what progress is,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
an economic definition of what progress is --

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
that somehow,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
if we get the right numbers to go up,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
we're going to be better off,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
whether that's on the stock market,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
whether that's with GDP

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and economic growth,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
that somehow life is going to get better.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
This is somehow appealing to human greed

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
instead of fear --

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
that more is better.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Come on. In the Western world, we have enough.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Maybe some parts of the world don't, but we have enough.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
And we've know for a long time that this is not a good measure

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
of the welfare of nations.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
In fact, the architect of our national accounting system,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Simon Kuznets, in the 1930s,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
said that, "A nation's welfare

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
can scarcely be inferred from their national income."

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
But we've created a national accounting system

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
which is firmly based on production

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
and producing stuff.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
And indeed, this is probably historical, and it had its time.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
In the second World War, we needed to produce a lot of stuff.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
And indeed, we were so successful at producing certain types of stuff

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
that we destroyed a lot of Europe, and we had to rebuild it afterwards.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
And so our national accounting system

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
became fixated on what we can produce.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
But as early as 1968,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
this visionary man, Robert Kennedy,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
at the start of his ill-fated presidential campaign,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
gave the most eloquent deconstruction

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
of gross national product

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
that ever has been.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
And he finished his talk with the phrase,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
that, "The gross national product

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
measures everything except that

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
which makes life worthwhile."

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
How crazy is that? That our measure of progress,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
our dominant measure of progress in society,

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
is measuring everything

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
except that which makes life worthwhile?

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
I believe, if Kennedy was alive today,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
he would be asking statisticians such as myself

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
to go out and find out

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
what makes life worthwhile.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
He'd be asking us to redesign

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
our national accounting system

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
to be based upon

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
such important things as social justice,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
sustainability

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
and people's well-being.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
And actually, social scientists have already gone out

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
and asked these questions around the world.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
This is from a global survey.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
It's asking people, what do they want.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And unsurprisingly, people all around the world

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
say that what they want

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
is happiness, for themselves,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
for their families, their children,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
their communities.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Okay, they think money is slightly important.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
It's there, but it's not nearly as important as happiness,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
and it's not nearly as important as love.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
We all need to love and be loved in life.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
It's not nearly as important as health.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
We want to be healthy and live a full life.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
These seem to be natural human aspirations.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Why are statisticians not measuring these?

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Why are we not thinking of the progress of nations in these terms,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
instead of just how much stuff we have?

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And really, this is what I've done with my adult life --

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
is think about how do we measure happiness,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
how do we measure well-being,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
how can we do that within environmental limits.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
And we created, at the organization that I work for,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
the New Economics Foundation,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
something we call the Happy Planet Index,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
because we think people should be happy and the planet should be happy.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Why don't we create a measure of progress that shows that?

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
And what we do,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
is we say that the ultimate outcome of a nation

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
is how successful is it

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
at creating happy and healthy lives for its citizens.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
That should be the goal

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
of every nation on the planet.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
But we have to remember

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
that there's a fundamental input to that,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
and that is how many of the planet's resources we use.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
We all have one planet. We all have to share it.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
It is the ultimate scarce resource,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
the one planet that we share.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And economics is very interested in scarcity.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
When it has a scarce resource

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
that it wants to turn into

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
a desirable outcome,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
it thinks in terms of efficiency.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
It thinks in terms of how much bang do we get for our buck.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
And this is a measure of how much well-being

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
we get for our planetary resource use.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
It is an efficiency measure.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And probably the easiest way to show you that,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
is to show you this graph.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Running horizontally along the graph,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
is "ecological footprint,"

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
which is a measure of how much resources we use

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
and how much pressure we put on the planet.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
More is bad.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Running vertically upwards,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
is a measure called "happy life years."

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
It's about the well-being of nations.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
It's like a happiness adjusted life-expectancy.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
It's like quality and quantity of life in nations.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
And the yellow dot there you see, is the global average.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Now, there's a huge array of nations

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
around that global average.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
To the top right of the graph,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
are countries which are doing reasonably well and producing well-being,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
but they're using a lot of planet to get there.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
They are the U.S.A.,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
other Western countries going across in those triangles

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
and a few Gulf states in there actually.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Conversely, at the bottom left of the graph,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
are countries that are not producing much well-being --

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
typically, sub-Saharan Africa.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
In Hobbesian terms,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
life is short and brutish there.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
The average life expectancy in many of these countries

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
is only 40 years.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Malaria, HIV/AIDS

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
are killing a lot of people

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
in these regions of the world.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
But now for the good news!

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
There are some countries up there, yellow triangles,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
that are doing better than global average,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
that are heading up towards the top left of the graph.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
This is an aspirational graph.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
We want to be top left, where good lives don't cost the earth.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
They're Latin American.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
The country on its own up at the top

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
is a place I haven't been to.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Maybe some of you have.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Costa Rica.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Costa Rica --

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
average life expectancy is 78-and-a-half years.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
That is longer than in the USA.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
They are, according to the latest Gallup world poll,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
the happiest nation on the planet --

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
than anybody; more than Switzerland and Denmark.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
They are the happiest place.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
They are doing that

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
on a quarter of the resources

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
that are used typically in [the] Western world --

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
a quarter of the resources.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
What's going on there?

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
What's happening in Costa Rica?

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
We can look at some of the data.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
99 percent of their electricity comes from renewable resources.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Their government is one of the first to commit

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
to be carbon neutral by 2021.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
They abolished the army

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
in 1949 --

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
1949.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
And they invested in social programs --

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
health and education.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
They have one of the highest literacy rates in Latin America

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
and in the world.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And they have that Latin vibe, don't they.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
They have the social connectedness.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
(Laughter)

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
The challenge is, that possibly -- and the thing we might have to think about --

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
is that the future

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
might not be North American,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
might not be Western European.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
It might be Latin American.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
And the challenge, really,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
is to pull the global average up here.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
That's what we need to do.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And if we're going to do that,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
we need to pull countries from the bottom,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
and we need to pull countries from the right of the graph.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
And then we're starting to create a happy planet.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
That's one way of looking at it.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Another way of looking at it is looking at time trends.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
We don't have good data going back for every country in the world,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
but for some of the richest countries, the OECD group, we do.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
And this is the trend in well-being over that time,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
a small increase,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
but this is the trend in ecological footprint.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
And so in strict happy-planet methodology,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
we've become less efficient

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
at turning our ultimate scarce resource

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
into the outcome we want to.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
And the point really is, is that I think,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
probably everybody in this room

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
would like society to get to 2050

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
without an apocalyptic

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
something happening.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
It's actually not very long away.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
It's half a human lifetime away.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
A child entering school today

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
will be my age in 2050.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
This is not the very distant future.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
This is what the U.K. government target

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
on carbon and greenhouse emissions looks like.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
And I put it to you, that is not business as usual.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
That is changing our business.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
That is changing the way we create our organizations,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
we do our government policy and we live our lives.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
And the point is,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
we need to carry on increasing well-being.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
No one can go to the polls

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
and say that quality of life is going to reduce.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
None of us, I think,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
want human progress to stop.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
I think we want it to carry on.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
I think we want the lot of humanity to keep on increasing.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
And I think this is where climate change skeptics and deniers come in.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
I think this is what they want. They want quality of life to keep increasing.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
They want to hold on to what they've got.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
And if we're going to engage them,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
I think that's what we've got to do.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
And that means we have to really increase efficiency even more.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
Now that's all very easy to draw graphs and things like that,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
but the point is we need to turn those curves.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
And this is where I think we can take a leaf

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
out of systems theory, systems engineers,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
where they create feedback loops,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
put the right information at the right point of time.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Human beings are very motivated by the "now."

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
You put a smart meter in your home,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
and you see how much electricity you're using right now,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
how much it's costing you,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
your kids go around and turn the lights off pretty quickly.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
What would that look like for society?

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Why is it, on the radio news every evening,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
I hear the FTSE 100, the Dow Jones, the dollar pound ratio --

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
I don't even know which way the dollar pound ratio should go to be good news.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
And why do I hear that?

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Why don't I hear how much energy Britain used yesterday,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
or American used yesterday?

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Did we meet our three percent annual target

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
on reducing carbon emissions?

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
That's how you create a collective goal.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
You put it out there into the media and start thinking about it.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
And we need positive feedback loops

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
for increasing well-being

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
At a government level, they might create national accounts of well-being.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
At a business level, you might look at the well-being of your employees,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
which we know is really linked to creativity,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
which is linked to innovation,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
and we're going to need a lot of innovation to deal with those environmental issues.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
At a personal level, we need these nudges too.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Maybe we don't quite need the data, but we need reminders.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
In the U.K., we have a strong public health message

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
on five fruit and vegetables a day

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
and how much exercise we should do -- never my best thing.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
What are these for happiness?

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
What are the five things that you should do every day

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
to be happier?

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
We did a project for the Government Office of Science a couple of years ago,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
a big program called the Foresight program --

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
lots and lots of people -- involved lots of experts --

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
everything evidence based -- a huge tome.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
But a piece of work we did was on: what five positive actions can you do

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
to improve well-being in your life?

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
And the point of these is

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
they are, not quite, the secrets of happiness,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
but they are things that I think happiness will flow out the side from.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
And the first of these is to connect,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
is that your social relationships

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
are the most important cornerstones of your life.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Do you invest the time with your loved ones

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
that you could do, and energy?

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Keep building them.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
The second one is be active.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
The fastest way out of a bad mood:

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
step outside, go for a walk, turn the radio on and dance.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Being active is great for our positive mood.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
The third one is take notice.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
How aware are you of things going on around the world,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
the seasons changing, people around you?

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Do you notice what's bubbling up for you and trying to emerge?

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Based on a lot of evidence for mindfulness,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
cognitive behavioral therapy,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
[very] strong for our well being.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
The fourth is keep learning

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
and keep is important --

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
learning throughout the whole life course.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Older people who keep learning and are curious,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
they have much better health outcomes than those who start to close down.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
But it doesn't have to be formal learning; it's not knowledge based.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
It's more curiosity.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
It can be learning to cook a new dish,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
picking up an instrument you forgot as a child.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Keep learning.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
And the final one

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
is that most anti-economic of activities,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
but give.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Our generosity, our altruism,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
our compassion,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
are all hardwired

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
to the reward mechanism in our brain.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
We feel good if we give.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
You can do an experiment where you give

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
two groups of people a hundred dollars in the morning.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
You tell one of them to spend it on themselves

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
and one on other people.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
You measure their happiness at the end of the day,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
those that have gone and spent on other people are much happier

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
that those that spent it on themselves.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
And these five ways,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
which we put onto these handy postcards,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
I would say, don't have to cost the earth.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
They don't have any carbon content.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
They don't need a lot of material goods to be satisfied.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
And so I think it's really quite feasible

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
that happiness does not cost the earth.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Now, Martin Luther King,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
on the eve of his death,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
gave an incredible speech.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
He said, "I know there are challenges ahead,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
there may be trouble ahead,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
but I fear no one. I don't care.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
I have been to the mountain top,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
and I have seen the Promised Land."

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Now, he was a preacher,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
but I believe the environmental movement

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
and, in fact, the business community, government,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
needs to go to the top of the mountain top,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
and it needs to look out,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
and it needs to see the Promised Land,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
or the land of promise,

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
and it needs to have a vision

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
of a world that we all want.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
And not only that, we need to create a Great Transition

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
to get there,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
and we need to pave that great transition with good things.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Human beings want to be happy.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Pave them with the five ways.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
And we need to have signposts

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
gathering people together and pointing them --

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
something like the Happy Planet Index.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
And then I believe

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
that we can all create a world we all want,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
where happiness does not cost the earth.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:28.000
(Applause)
