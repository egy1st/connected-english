WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
We live on a human-dominated planet,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
putting unprecedented pressure

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
on the systems on Earth.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is bad news, but perhaps surprising to you,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
it's also part of the good news.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We're the first generation -- thanks to science --

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
to be informed that we may be

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
undermining the stability and the ability

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
of planet Earth

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
to support human development as we know it.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It's also good news, because the planetary risks we're facing

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
are so large,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
that business as usual is not an option.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
In fact, we're in a phase

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
where transformative change is necessary,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
which opens the window for innovation,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
for new ideas and new paradigms.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
This is a scientific journey on the challenges facing humanity

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
in the global phase of sustainability.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
On this journey, I'd like to bring, apart from yourselves,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
a good friend,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
a stakeholder, who's always absent

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
when we deal with the negotiations on environmental issues,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
a stakeholder who refuses to compromise --

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
planet Earth.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
So I thought I'd bring her with me today on stage,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
to have her as a witness

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
of a remarkable journey,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
which humbly reminds us

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
of the period of grace we've had

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
over the past 10,000 years.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
This is the living conditions on the planet over the last 100,000 years.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
It's a very important period --

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
it's roughly half the period when we've been fully modern humans on the planet.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
We've had the same, roughly, abilities

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
that developed civilizations as we know it.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
This is the environmental conditions on the planet.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Here, used as a proxy, temperature variability.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
It was a jumpy ride. 80,000 years back in a crisis,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
we leave Africa, we colonize Australia

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
in another crisis, 60,000 years back,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
we leave Asia for Europe

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
in another crisis, 40,000 years back,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and then we enter

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
the remarkably stable Holocene phase,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
the only period in the whole history of the planet,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
that we know of, that can support human development.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
A thousand years into this period,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
we abandon our hunting and gathering patterns.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
We go from a couple of million people

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
to the seven billion people we are today.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
The Mesopotamian culture: we invent agriculture,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
we domesticate animals and plants.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
You have the Roman, the Greek and the story as you know it.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
The only phase, as we know it

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
that can support humanity.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
The trouble is we're putting a quadruple sqeeze

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
on this poor planet,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
a quadruple sqeeze, which, as its first squeeze,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
has population growth of course.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Now, this is not only about numbers;

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
this is not only about the fact that we're seven billion people

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
committed to nine billion people, it's an equity issue as well.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
The majority of the environmental impacts on the planet

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
have been caused by the rich minority,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
the 20 percent that jumped onto the industrial bandwagon

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
in the mid-18th century.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
The majority of the planet,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
aspiring for development, having the right for development,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
are in large aspiring for an unsustainable lifestyle,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
a momentous pressure.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
The second pressure on the planet is, of course the climate agenda --

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
the big issue -- where the policy interpretation of science

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
is that it would be enough

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
to stabilize greenhouse gases at 450 ppm

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
to avoid average temperatures

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
exceeding two degrees,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
to avoid the risk that we may be destabilizing

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
the West Antarctic Ice Sheet,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
holding six meters -- level rising,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
the risk of destabilizing the Greenland Ice Sheet,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
holding another seven meters -- sea level rising.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Now, you would have wished the climate pressure

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
to hit a strong planet, a resilient planet,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
but unfortunately, the third pressure

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
is the ecosystem decline.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Never have we seen, in the past 50 years,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
such a sharp decline

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
of ecosystem functions and services on the planet,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
one of them being the ability to regulate climate on the long term,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
in our forests, land and biodiversity.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
The forth pressure is surprise,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
the notion and the evidence

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
that we need to abandon our old paradigm,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
that ecosystems behave linearly, predictably,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
controllably in our -- so to say -- linear systems,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and that in fact, surprise is universal,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
as systems tip over very rapidly, abruptly

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and often irreversibly.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
This, dear friends, poses a human pressure on the planet

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
of momentous scale.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
We may, in fact, have entered a new geological era --

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
the Anthropocene,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
where humans are the predominant driver of change

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
at a planetary level.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Now, as a scientist,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
what's the evidence for this?

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Well, the evidence is,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
unfortunately, ample.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
It's not only carbon dioxide

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
that has this hockey stick pattern of accelerated change.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
You can take virtually any parameter

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
that matters for human well-being --

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
nitrous oxide, methane,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
deforestation, overfishing

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
land degredation, loss of species --

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
they all show the same pattern

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
over the past 200 years.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Simultaneously, they branch off in the mid-50s,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
10 years after the Second World War,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
showing very clearly that the great acceleration of the human enterprise

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
starts in the mid-50s.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
You see, for the first time, an imprint on the global level.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
And I can tell you,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
you enter the disciplinary research in each of these,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
you find something remarkably important,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
the conclusion that we may have come to the point

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
where we have to bend the curves,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
that we may have entered the most challenging and exciting decade

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
in the history humanity on the planet,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
the decade when we have to bend the curves.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Now, as if this was not enough --

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
to just bend the curves and understanding the accelerated pressure on the planet --

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
we also have to recognize the fact

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
that systems do have multiple stable states,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
separated by thresholds -- illustrated here by this ball and cup diagram,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
where the depth of the cup is the resilience of the system.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Now, the system may gradually --

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
under pressure of climate change,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
erosion, biodiversity loss --

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
lose the depth of the cup, the resilience,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
but appear to be healthy

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
and appear to suddenly, under a threshold,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
be tipping over. Upff.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Sorry. Changing state

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and literally ending up

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
in an undesired situation,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
where new biophysical logic takes over,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
new species take over, and the system gets locked.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Do we have evidence of this? Yes, coral reef systems.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Biodiverse, low-nutrient, hard coral systems

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
under multiple pressures of overfishing,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
unsustainable tourism, climate change.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
A trigger and the system tips over,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
loses its resilience,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
soft corals take over,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
and we get undesired systems

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
that cannot support economic and social development.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
The Arctic -- a beautiful system --

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
a regulating biome at the planetary level,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
taking the knock after knock on climate change,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
appearing to be in a good state.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
No scientist could predict that in 2007,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
suddenly, what could be crossing a threshold.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
The system suddenly, very surprisingly, loses 30 to 40 percent

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
of its summer ice cover.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
And the drama is, of course, that

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
when the system does this, the logic may change.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
It may get locked in an undesired state,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
because it changes color, absorbs more energy,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
and the system may get stuck.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
In my mind, the largest red flag warning for humanity

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
that we are in a precarious situation.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
As a sideline, you know that the only red flag that popped up here

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
was a submarine from an unnamed country

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
that planted a red flag at the bottom of the Arctic

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
to be able to control the oil resources.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Now, if we have evidence, which we now have,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
that wetlands, forests,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
[unclear] monsoon system, the rainforests,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
behave in this nonlinear way.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
30 or so scientists around the world

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
gathered and asked a question for the first time,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
"Do we have to put the planet into the the pot?"

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
So we have to ask ourselves:

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
are we threatening this extraordinarily stable Holocene state?

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Are we in fact putting ourselves in a situation

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
where we're coming too close

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
to thresholds that could lead

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
to deleterious and very undesired,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
if now catastrophic, change

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
for human development?

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
You know, you don't want to stand there.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
In fact, you're not even allowed to stand

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
where this gentleman is standing,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
at the foaming, slippery waters at the threshold.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
In fact, there's a fence

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
quite upstream of this threshold,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
beyond which you are in a danger zone.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
And this is the new paradigm,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
which we gathered two, three years back,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
recognizing that our old paradigm

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
of just analyzing and pushing and predicting

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
parameters into the future,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
aiming at minimalizing environmental impacts, is of the past.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Now we to ask ourselves:

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
which are the large environmental processes

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
that we have to be stewards of

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
to keep ourselves safe in the Holocene?

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
And could we even,

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
thanks to major advancements in Earth systems science,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
identify the thresholds,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
the points where we may expect nonlinear change?

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
And could we even define

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
a planetary boundary, a fence,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
within which we then have a safe operating space for humanity?

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
This work, which was published in "Nature,"

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
late 2009,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
after a number of years of analysis,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
led to the final proposition

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
that we can only find

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
nine planetary boundaries

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
with which, under active stewardship,

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
would allow ourselves to have a safe operating space.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
These include, of course, climate.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
It may surprise you that it's not only climate.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
But it shows that we are interconnected, among many systems on the planet,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
with the three big systems, climate change,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
stratospheric ozone depletion and ocean acidification

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
being the three big systems,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
where the scientific evidence of large-scale thresholds

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
in the paleo-record of the history of the planet.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
But we also include, what we call, the slow variables,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
the systems that, under the hood,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
regulate and buffer the capacity of the resilience of the planet --

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
the interference of the big nitrogen and phosphorus cycles on the planet,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
land use change, rate of biodiversity loss,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
freshwater use,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
functions which regulate

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
biomass on the planet, carbon sequestration, diversity.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
And then we have two parameters which we were not able to quantify --

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
air pollution,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
including warming gases and air-polluting sulfates and nitrates,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
but also chemical pollution.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Together, these form an integrated whole

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
for guiding human development in the Anthropocene,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
understanding that the planet

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
is a complex self-regulating system.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
In fact, most evidence indicates

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
that these nine may behave as three Musketeers,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
"One for all. All for one."

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
You degrade forests, you go beyond the boundary on land,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
you undermine the ability of the climate system

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
to stay stable.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
The drama here is, in fact, that

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
it may show that the climate challenge

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
is the easy one,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
if you consider the whole challenge

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
of sustainable development.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Now this is the Big Bang equivalent then of human development

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
within the safe operating space of the planetary boundaries.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
What you see here in black line is the safe operating space,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
the quantified boundaries,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
as suggested by this analysis.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
The yellow dot in the middle here is our starting point,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
the pre-industrial point,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
where we're very safely in the safe operating space.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
In the '50s, we start branching out.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
In the '60s already, through the green revolution

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
and the Haber-Bosch process

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
of fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere --

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
you know, human's today take out more nitrogen from the atmosphere

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
than the whole biosphere does naturally as a whole.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
We don't transgress the climate boundary until the early '90s,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
actually, right after Rio.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
And today, we are in a situation where we estimate

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
that we've transgressed three boundaries,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
the rate of biodiversity loss,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
which is the sixth extinction period in the history of humanity --

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
one of them being the extinctions of the dinosaurs --

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
nitrogen and climate change.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
But we still have some degrees of freedom on the others,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
but we are approaching fast

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
on land, water, phosphorus and oceans.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
But this gives a new paradigm

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
to guide humanity,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
to put the light on our, so far

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
overpowered industrial vehicle,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
which operates as if

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
we're only on a dark, straight highway.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Now the question then is:

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
how gloomy is this?

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Is then sustainable development utopia?

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Well, there's no science to suggest.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
In fact, there is ample science

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
to indicate that we can do this transformative change,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
that we have the ability

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
to now move into a new innovative,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
a transformative gear,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
across scales.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
The drama is, of course,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
is that 200 countries on this planet

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
have to simultaneously start moving

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
in the same direction.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
But it changes fundamentally our governance and management paradigm,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
from the current linear,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
command and control thinking,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
looking at efficiencies and optimization

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
towards a much more flexible,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
a much more adaptive approach,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
where we recognize that redundancy,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
both in social and environmental systems,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
is key to be able to deal

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
with a turbulent era of global change.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
We have to invest in persistence,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
in the ability of social systems and ecological systems

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
to withstand shocks and still remain in that desired cup.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000
We have to invest in transformations capability,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
moving from crisis into innovation

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
and the ability to rise after a crisis,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
and of course to adapt to unavoidable change.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
This is a new paradigm.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
We're not doing that at any scale on governance.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
But is it happening anywhere?

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Do we have any examples of success

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
on this mind shift being applied at the local level?

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Well, yes, in fact we do

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
and the list can start becoming longer and longer.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
There's good news here,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
for example, from Latin America,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
where plow-based farming systems

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
of the '50s and '60s

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
led farming basically to a dead-end,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
with lower and lower yields, degrading the organic matter

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
and fundamental problems at the livelihood levels

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
in Paraguay, Uruguay and a number of countries, Brazil,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
leading to innovation and entrepreneurship

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
among farmers in partnership with scientists

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
into an agricultural revolution of zero tillage systems

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
combined with mulch farming

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
with locally adapted technologies,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
which today, for example, in some countries,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
have led to a tremendous increase

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
in area under mulch, zero till farming

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
which, not only produces more food,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
but also sequesters carbon.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
The Australian Great Barrier Reef is another success story.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Under the realization from tourist operators,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
fishermen,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
the Australian Great Barrier Reef Authority and scientists

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
that the Great Barrier Reef is doomed

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
under the current governance regime.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Global change, beautification rack culture,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
overfishing and unsustainable tourism,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
all together placing this system

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
in the realization of crisis.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
But the window of opportunity was innovation and new mindset,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
which today has led to a completely new governance strategy

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
to build resilience,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
acknowledge redundancy

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
and invest in the whole system as an integrated whole,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
and then allow for much more redundancy in the system.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Sweden, the country I come from, has other examples,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
where wetlands in southern Sweden were seen as --

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
as in many countries -- as flood-prone polluted nuisance

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
in the peri-urban regions.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
But again, a crisis, new partnerships,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
actors locally, transforming these

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
into a key component

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
of sustainable urban planning.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
So crisis leading into opportunities.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Now, what about the future?

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Well, the future, of course, has one massive challenge,

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
which is feeding a world of nine billion people.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
We need nothing less than a new green revolution,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
and the planet boundaries shows

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
that agriculture has to go from a source of greenhouse gases to a sink.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
It has to basically do this on current land.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
We cannot expand anymore,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
because it erodes the planetary boundaries.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
We cannot continue consuming water as we do today,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
with 25 percent of world rivers not even reaching the ocean.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
And we need a transformation.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
Well, interestingly, and based on my work

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
and others in Africa, for example,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
we've shown that even the most vulnerable small-scale rainfall farming systems,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
with innovations and supplementary irrigation

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
to bridge dry spells and droughts,

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
sustainable sanitation systems to close the loop on nutrients

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
from toilets back to farmers' fields,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
and innovations in tillage systems,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
we can triple, quadruple, yield levels

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
on current land.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Elinor Ostrom,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
the latest Nobel laureate of economics,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
clearly shows empirically across the world

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
that we can govern the commons

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
if we invest in trust,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
local, action-based partnerships

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
and cross-scale institutional innovations,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
where local actors,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
together, can deal with the global commons

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
at a large scale.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
But even on the hard policy area we have innovations.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
We know that we have to move from our fossil dependence

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
very quickly into a low-carbon economy in record time.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
And what shall we do?

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Everybody talks about carbon taxes -- it won't work -- emission schemes,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
but for example, one policy measure,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
feed-in tariffs on the energy system,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
which is already applied,

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
from China doing it on offshore wind systems,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
all the way to the U.S.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
where you give the guaranteed price for investment in renewable energy,

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
but you can subsidize electricity to poor people.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
You get people out of poverty.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
You solve the climate issue with regards to the energy sector,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
while at the same time, stimulating innovation --

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
examples of things that can be out scaled quickly

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
at the planetary level.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
So there is -- no doubt -- opportunity here,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
and we can list many, many examples

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
of transformative opportunities around the planet.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
The key though in all of these,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
the red thread,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
is the shift in mindset,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
moving away from a situation where we simply are pushing ourselves

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
into a dark future,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
where we instead backcast our future,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
and we say, "What is the playing field on the planet?

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
What are the planetary boundaries

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
within which we can safely operate?"

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
and then backtrack innovations within that.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
But of course, the drama is, it clearly shows

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
that incremental change is not an option.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
So, there is scientific evidence.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
They sort of say the harsh news,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
that we are facing the largest

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
transformative development

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
since the industrialization.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
In fact, what we have to do over the next 40 years

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
is much more dramatic and more exciting

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
than what we did when we moved into

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
the situation we're in today.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Now, science indicates that,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
yes, we can achieve a prosperous future

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
within the safe operating space,

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
if we move simultaneously,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
collaborating on a global level, from local to global scale,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
in transformative options, which build resilience on a finite planet.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
Thank you.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.000
(Applause)
