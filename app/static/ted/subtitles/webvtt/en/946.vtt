00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Tyler Dewar: The way I feel right now

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
is that all of the other speakers

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
have said exactly what I wanted to say.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
(Laughter)

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
And it seems that the only thing left for me to say

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
is to thank you all for your kindness.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
TD: But maybe in the spirit

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
of appreciating the kindness of you all,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I could share with you

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
a little story about myself.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
TD: From the time I was very young, onward,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I was given

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
a lot of different responsibilities,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and it always seemed to me, when I was young,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
that everything was laid out before me.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
All of the plans for me were already made.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
I was given the clothes that I needed to wear

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and told where I needed to be,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
given these very precious

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and holy looking robes to wear,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
with the understanding

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
that it was something sacred or important.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
TD: But before that kind of formal lifestyle happened for me,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I was living in eastern Tibet with my family.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And when I was seven years old,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
all of a sudden,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
a search party arrived at my home.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
They were looking the next Karmapa,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
and I noticed they were talking to my mom and dad,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and the news came to me that they were telling me

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
that I was the Karmapa.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
And these days, people ask me a lot,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
how did that feel.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
How did that feel when they came and whisked you away,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
and your lifestyle completely changed?

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
And what I mostly say is that,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
at that time,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
it was a pretty interesting idea to me.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
I thought that things would be pretty fun

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
and there would be more things to play with.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
(Laughter)

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
TD: But it didn't turn out to be so fun and entertaining,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
as I thought it would have been.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
I was placed

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
in a pretty strictly controlled environment.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
And immediately,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
a lot of different responsibilities,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
in terms of my education and so forth, were heaped upon me.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
I was separated, largely, from my family,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
including my mother and father.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
I didn't have have many personal friends

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
to spend time with,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
but I was expected to perform

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
these prescribed duties.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
So it turned out that my fantasy

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
about an entertaining life of being the Karmapa

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
wasn't going to come true.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
It more felt to be the case to me

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
that I was being treated like a statue,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
and I was to sit in one place

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
like a statue would.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
TD: Nevertheless, I felt that,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
even though I've been separated from my loved ones --

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
and, of course, now I'm even further away.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
When I was 14, I escaped from Tibet

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
and became even further removed

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
from my mother and father,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
my relatives, my friends

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
and my homeland.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
But nevertheless,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
there's no real sense of separation from me in my heart,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
in terms of the love that I feel

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
for these people.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
I feel, still, a very strong connection of love

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
for all of these people

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
and for the land.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
TD: And I still do

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
get to keep in touch with my mother and father,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
albeit infrequently.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
I talk to my mother

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
once in a blue moon on the telephone.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
And my experience is that,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
when I'm talking to her,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
with every second that passes

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
during our conversation,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
the feeling of love that binds us

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
is bringing us closer and closer together.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
TD: So those were just a few remarks

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
about my personal background.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
And in terms of other things that I wanted to share with you,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
in terms of ideas,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
I think it's wonderful to have a situation like this,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
where so many people from different backgrounds and places

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
can come together,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
exchange their ideas

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
and form relationships of friendship with each other.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
And I think that's symbolic

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
of what we're seeing in the world in general,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
that the world is becoming smaller and smaller,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
and that all of the peoples in the world

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
are enjoying more opportunities for connection.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
That's wonderful,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
but we should also remember

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
that we should have a similar process happening on the inside.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Along with outward development

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
and increase of opportunity,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
there should be inward development

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
and deepening of our heart connections

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
as well as our outward connections.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
So we spoke and we heard some

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
about design this week.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
I think that it's important for us to remember

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
that we need

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
to keep pushing forward

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
on the endeavor

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
of the design of the heart.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
We heard a lot about technology this week,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
and it's important for us to remember

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
to invest a lot of our energy

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
in improving the technology of the heart.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
TD: So, even though I'm somewhat happy

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
about the wonderful developments that are happening in the world,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
still, I feel a sense of impediment,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
when it comes

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
to the ability that we have

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
to connect with each other on a heart-to-heart, or a mind-to-mind, level.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
I feel that there are some things

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
that are getting in the way.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
TC: My relationship

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
to this concept of heart-to-heart connection, or mind-to-mind connection,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
is an interesting one,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
because, as a spiritual leader, I'm always attempting

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
to open my heart to others

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
and offer myself up

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
for heart-to-heart and mind-to-mind connections

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
in a genuine way with other people,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
but at the same time,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
I've always been advised

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
that I need to emphasize intelligence

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
over the heart-to-heart connections,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
because, being someone in a position like mine,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
if I don't rely primarily on intelligence,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
then something dangerous may happen to me.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
So it's an interesting paradox at play there.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
But I had a really striking experience once,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
when a group from Afghanistan

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
came to visit me,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
and we had a really interesting conversation.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
TD: So we ended up talking about the Bamiyan Buddhas,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
which, as you know,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
were destroyed some years ago in Afghanistan.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
But the basis of our conversation

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
was the different approach to spirituality

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
on the part of the Muslim

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
and Buddhist traditions.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Of course, in Muslim,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
because of the teachings around the concept of idolatry,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
you don't find as many

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
physical representations of divinity

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
or of spiritual liberation

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
as you do in the Buddhist tradition,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
where, of course, there are many statues of the Buddha

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
that are highly revered.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
So, we were talking about the differences

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
between the traditions

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
and what many people perceived

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
as the tragedy of the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
but I offered the suggestion

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
that perhaps we could look at this in a positive way.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
What we saw in the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
was the depletion of matter,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
some solid substance

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
falling down and disintegrating.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Maybe we could look at that to be more similar

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
to the falling of the Berlin Wall,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
where a divide

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
that had kept two types of people apart

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
had collapsed and opened up a door

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
for further communication.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
So I think that, in this way,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
it's always possible for us

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
to derive something positive

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
that can help us understand one another better.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
TD: So, with regard to the development

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
that we've been talking about

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
here at this conference,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
I really feel

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
that the development that we make

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
shouldn't create a further burden

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
for us as human beings,

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
but should be used

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
to improve

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
our fundamental lifestyle

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
of how we live in the world.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
TD: Of course, I rejoice

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
in the development and the growth and the rise

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
of the noble land of India, the great country of India,

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
but at the same time, I think,

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
as some of us have acknowledged,

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
we need to be aware

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
that some aspects of this rise

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
are coming at the cost

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
of the very ground

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000
on which we stand.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.000
So, as we are climbing the tree,

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
some of the things that we're doing

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
in order to climb the tree

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
are actually undermining

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
the tree's very root.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
And so,

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
what I think it comes down to

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000
is a question of, not only having information of what's going on,

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
but paying attention to that

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
and letting that shift our motivation

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
to become more sincere

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
and genuinely positive.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
We have hear, this week,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000
about the horrible sufferings, for example,

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
that so many women of the world

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
are enduring day-to-day.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
We have that information,

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
but what often happens to us

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000
is that we don't really choose to pay attention to it.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
We don't really choose to allow that

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
to cause there to be a shift in our hearts.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
So I think the way forward for the world --

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
one that will bring the path of outer development

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
in harmony

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
with the real root of happiness --

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
is that we allow

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
the information that we have

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
to really make a change in our heart.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
TD: So I think that sincere motivation

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000
is very important for our future well-being,

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000
or deep sense of well-being as humans,

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000
and I think that means sinking in

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
to whatever it is you're doing now.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000
Whatever work you're trying to do now to benefit the world,

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000
sink into that,

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
get a full taste of that.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
TD: So, since we've been here this week,

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000
we've taken millions of breaths, collectively,

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
and perhaps we haven't witnessed

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
any course changes

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
happening in our lives,

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
but we often miss the very subtle changes.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.000
And I think

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000
that sometimes we develop

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
grand concepts

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
of what happiness

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000
might look like for us,

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000
but that, if we pay attention,

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000
we can see that there are little symbols of happiness

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
in every breath that we take.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000
TD: So, every one of you who has come here

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000
is so talented,

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000
and you have so much to offer to the world,

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000
I think it would be a good note to conclude on then

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000
to just take a moment

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000
to appreciate how fortunate we are

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000
to have come together in this way and exchanged ideas

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000
and really form a strong aspiration

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000
and energy within ourselves

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000
that we will take the good

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000
that has come from this conference,

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000
the momentum, the positivity,

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000
and we will spread that and plant it

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.000
in all of the corners of the world.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000
His Holiness the Karmapa: Tomorrow is my Talk.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000
TD: Lakshmi has worked incredibly hard,

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000
even in inviting me,

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000
let alone everything else that she has done

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
to make this happen,

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000
and I was somewhat resistant at times,

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:32.000
and I was also very nervous throughout this week.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000
I was feeling under the weather and dizzy and so forth,

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000
and people would ask me, why.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000
I would tell them, "It's because I have to talk tomorrow."

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000
And so Lakshmi had to put up with me through all of that,

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000
but I very much appreciate

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000
the opportunity she's given me

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
to be here.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000
And to you, everyone, thank you very much.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000
(Applause)

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000
HH: Thank you very much.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000
(Applause)
