00:00:01.111 --> 00:00:04.126
Everyone, please think
of your biggest personal goal.

00:00:04.857 --> 00:00:08.405
For real -- you can take a second.
You've got to feel this to learn it.

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.730
Take a few seconds and think
of your personal biggest goal, okay?

00:00:12.167 --> 00:00:14.848
Imagine deciding right now
that you're going to do it.

00:00:14.872 --> 00:00:18.141
Imagine telling someone that you
meet today what you're going to do.

00:00:18.165 --> 00:00:20.400
Imagine their congratulations,

00:00:20.424 --> 00:00:21.976
and their high image of you.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.349
Doesn't it feel good to say it out loud?

00:00:24.373 --> 00:00:26.839
Don't you feel one step closer already,

00:00:26.863 --> 00:00:29.317
like it's already becoming
part of your identity?

00:00:29.341 --> 00:00:33.337
Well, bad news: you should
have kept your mouth shut,

00:00:33.361 --> 00:00:34.790
because that good feeling

00:00:34.814 --> 00:00:36.885
now will make you less likely to do it.

00:00:37.495 --> 00:00:39.821
The repeated psychology tests have proven

00:00:39.845 --> 00:00:43.193
that telling someone your goal
makes it less likely to happen.

00:00:44.106 --> 00:00:45.411
Any time you have a goal,

00:00:45.435 --> 00:00:47.459
there are some steps that need to be done,

00:00:47.483 --> 00:00:50.064
some work that needs to be done
in order to achieve it.

00:00:50.088 --> 00:00:53.384
Ideally you would not be satisfied
until you'd actually done the work.

00:00:53.408 --> 00:00:56.280
But when you tell someone your goal
and they acknowledge it,

00:00:56.304 --> 00:00:59.207
psychologists have found
that it's called a "social reality."

00:00:59.231 --> 00:01:02.241
The mind is kind of tricked
into feeling that it's already done.

00:01:02.265 --> 00:01:04.520
And then because you've felt
that satisfaction,

00:01:04.544 --> 00:01:07.492
you're less motivated to do
the actual hard work necessary.

00:01:07.516 --> 00:01:08.825
(Laughter)

00:01:08.849 --> 00:01:10.881
So this goes against conventional wisdom

00:01:10.905 --> 00:01:13.294
that we should tell our friends
our goals, right?

00:01:13.318 --> 00:01:15.843
So they hold us to it.

00:01:15.867 --> 00:01:17.976
So, let's look at the proof.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.826
1926: Kurt Lewin,
founder of social psychology,

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.330
called this "substitution."

00:01:22.354 --> 00:01:25.719
1933: Wera Mahler found
when it was acknowledged by others,

00:01:25.743 --> 00:01:27.458
it felt real in the mind.

00:01:27.482 --> 00:01:29.976
1982, Peter Gollwitzer
wrote a whole book about this,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.543
and in 2009,

00:01:31.567 --> 00:01:34.114
he did some new tests that were published.

00:01:34.138 --> 00:01:35.606
It goes like this:

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.629
163 people across four separate tests.

00:01:39.216 --> 00:01:41.510
Everyone wrote down their personal goal.

00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:45.421
Then half of them announced
their commitment to this goal to the room,

00:01:45.445 --> 00:01:46.627
and half didn't.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.531
Then everyone was given 45 minutes of work

00:01:49.555 --> 00:01:51.850
that would directly lead them
towards their goal,

00:01:51.874 --> 00:01:54.318
but they were told
that they could stop at any time.

00:01:54.342 --> 00:01:56.225
Now, those who kept their mouths shut

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:58.976
worked the entire 45 minutes on average,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.537
and when asked afterward,

00:02:00.561 --> 00:02:03.225
said that they felt
that they had a long way to go still

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:04.402
to achieve their goal.

00:02:04.426 --> 00:02:05.976
But those who had announced it

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.842
quit after only 33 minutes, on average,

00:02:08.866 --> 00:02:10.596
and when asked afterward,

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.331
said that they felt much closer
to achieving their goal.

00:02:13.355 --> 00:02:16.012
So if this is true, what can we do?

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:20.237
Well, you could resist the temptation
to announce your goal.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.284
You can delay the gratification
that the social acknowledgment brings,

00:02:25.308 --> 00:02:29.088
and you can understand that your mind
mistakes the talking for the doing.

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:32.048
But if you do need
to talk about something,

00:02:32.072 --> 00:02:36.419
you can state it in a way
that gives you no satisfaction,

00:02:36.443 --> 00:02:38.562
such as, "I really want
to run this marathon,

00:02:38.586 --> 00:02:40.316
so I need to train five times a week

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.043
and kick my ass if I don't, okay?"

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.811
So audience, next time you're
tempted to tell someone your goal,

00:02:45.835 --> 00:02:46.985
what will you say?

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:48.010
(Silence)

00:02:48.034 --> 00:02:49.286
Exactly! Well done.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.976
(Laughter)

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
(Applause)
