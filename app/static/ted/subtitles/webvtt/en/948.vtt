WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
This strange-looking plant is called the Llareta.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
What looks like moss covering rocks

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
is actually a shrub

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
comprised of thousands of branches,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
each containing clusters of tiny green leaves at the end

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
and so densely packed together

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
that you could actually stand on top of it.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
This individual lives in the Atacama Desert in Chile,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and it happens to be 3,000 years old.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It also happens to be a relative of parsley.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
For the past five years, I've been researching,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
working with biologists

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and traveling all over the world

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
to find continuously living organisms

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
that are 2,000 years old and older.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
The project is part art and part science.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
There's an environmental component.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And I'm also trying to create a means

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
in which to step outside our quotidian experience of time

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and to start to consider a deeper timescale.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I selected 2,000 years as my minimum age

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
because I wanted to start at what we consider to be year zero

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and work backward from there.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
What you're looking at now is a tree called Jomon Sugi,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
living on the remote island of Yakushima.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
The tree was in part a catalyst for the project.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I'd been traveling in Japan

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
without an agenda other than to photograph,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and then I heard about this tree

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
that is 2,180 years old

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and knew that I had to go visit it.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
It wasn't until later, when I was actually back home in New York

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
that I got the idea for the project.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
So it was the slow churn, if you will.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I think it was my longstanding desire

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
to bring together my interest

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
in art, science and philosophy

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
that allowed me to be ready

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
when the proverbial light bulb went on.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So I started researching, and to my surprise,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
this project had never been done before

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
in the arts or the sciences.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And -- perhaps naively --

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I was surprised to find that there isn't even an area in the sciences

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
that deals with this idea

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
of global species longevity.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So what you're looking at here

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
is the rhizocarpon geographicum, or map lichen,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and this is around 3,000 years old

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and lives in Greenland,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
which is a long way to go for some lichens.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Visiting Greenland was more like

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
traveling back in time

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
than just traveling very far north.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
It was very primal and more remote

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
than anything I'd ever experienced before.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And this is heightened by a couple of particular experiences.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
One was when I had been dropped off by boat

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
on a remote fjord,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
only to find that the archeologists I was supposed to meet

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
were nowhere to be found.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And it's not like you could send them a text or shoot them an e-mail,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
so I was literally left to my own devices.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
But luckily, it worked out obviously,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
but it was a humbling experience

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
to feel so disconnected.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And then a few days later,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
we had the opportunity to go fishing in a glacial stream

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
near our campsite,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
where the fish were so abundant

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
that you could literally reach into the stream

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
and grab out a foot-long trout with your bare hands.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
It was like visiting

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
a more innocent time on the planet.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And then, of course, there's the lichens.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
These lichens grow only one centimeter

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
every hundred years.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I think that really puts human lifespans

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
into a different perspective.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
And what you're looking at here

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
is an aerial photo take over eastern Oregon.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And if the title "Searching for Armillaria Death Rings,"

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
sounds ominous, it is.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
The Armillaria is actually a predatory fungus,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
killing certain species of trees in the forest.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
It's also more benignly known

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
as the honey mushroom or the "humongous fungus"

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
because it happens to be

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
one of the world's largest organisms as well.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
So with the help of some biologists studying the fungus,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
I got some maps and some GPS coordinates

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
and chartered a plane

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and started looking for the death rings,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
the circular patterns

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
in which the fungus kills the trees.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
So I'm not sure if there are any in this photo,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
but I do know the fungus is down there.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
And then this back down on the ground

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
and you can see that the fungus is actually invading this tree.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
So that white material that you see

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
in between the bark and the wood

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
is the mycelial felt of the fungus,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
and what it's doing -- it's actually

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
slowly strangling the tree to death

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
by preventing the flow of water and nutrients.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
So this strategy has served it pretty well --

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
it's 2,400 years old.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
And then from underground to underwater.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
This is a Brain Coral living in Tobago

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
that's around 2,000 years old.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
And I had to overcome my fear of deep water to find this one.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
This is at about 60 feet

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
or 18 meters, depth.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
And you'll see, there's some damage to the surface of the coral.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
That was actually caused by a school of parrot fish

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
that had started eating it,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
though luckily, they lost interest before killing it.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Luckily still, it seems to be out of harm's way

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
of the recent oil spill.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
But that being said, we just as easily could have lost

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
one of the oldest living things on the planet,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
and the full impact of that disaster

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
is still yet to be seen.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Now this is something that I think

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
is one of the most quietly resilient things on the planet.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
This is clonal colony

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
of Quaking Aspen trees, living in Utah,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
that is literally 80,000 years old.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
What looks like a forest

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
is actually only one tree.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Imagine that it's one giant root system

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
and each tree is a stem

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
coming up from that system.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
So what you have is one giant,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
interconnected,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
genetically identical individual

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
that's been living for 80,000 years.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
It also happens to be male

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
and, in theory immortal.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
(Laughter)

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
This is a clonal tree as well.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
This is the spruce Gran Picea,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
which at 9,550 years

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
is a mere babe in the woods.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
The location of this tree

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
is actually kept secret for its own protection.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
I spoke to the biologist who discovered this tree,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
and he told me that that spindly growth you see there in the center

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
is most likely a product of climate change.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
As it's gotten warmer on the top of the mountain,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
the vegetation zone is actually changing.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
So we don't even necessarily have to have

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
direct contact with these organisms

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
to have a very real impact on them.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
This is the Fortingall Yew --

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
no, I'm just kidding --

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
this is the Fortingall Yew.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
(Laughter)

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
But I put that slide in there

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
because I'm often asked if there are any animals in the project.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
And aside from coral,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
the answer is no.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Does anybody know how old the oldest tortoise is --

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
any guesses?

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
(Audience: 300.)

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Rachel Sussman: 300? No, 175

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
is the oldest living tortoise,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
so nowhere near 2,000.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
And then, you might have heard

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
of this giant clam that was discovered

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
off the coast of northern Iceland

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
that reached 405 years old.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
However, it died in the lab

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
as they were determining its age.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
The most interesting discovery of late, I think

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
is the so-called immortal jellyfish,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
which has actually been observed in the lab

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
to be able to be able to revert back to the polyp state

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
after reaching full maturity.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
So that being said,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
it's highly unlikely that any jellyfish would survive that long in the wild.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
And back to the yew here.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
So as you can see, it's in a churchyard;

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
it's in Scotland. It's behind a protective wall.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
And there are actually a number or ancient yews

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
in churchyards around the U.K.,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
but if you do the math, you'll remember

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
it's actually the yew trees that were there first, then the churches.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
And now down to another part of the world.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
I had the opportunity to travel around the Limpopo Province in South Africa

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
with an expert in Baobab trees.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And we saw a number of them,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
and this is most likely the oldest.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
It's around 2,000,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
and it's called the Sagole Baobab.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
And you know, I think of all of these organisms

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
as palimpsests.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
They contain thousands of years

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
of their own histories within themselves,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
and they also contain records of natural and human events.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
And the Baobabs in particular

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
are a great example of this.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
You can see that this one

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
has names carved into its trunk,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
but it also records some natural events.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
So the Baobabs, as they get older,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
tend to get pulpy in their centers and hollow out.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
And this can create

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
great natural shelters for animals,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
but they've also been appropriated

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
for some rather dubious human uses,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
including a bar, a prison

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
and even a toilet inside of a tree.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
And this brings me to another favorite of mine --

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
I think, because it is just so unusual.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
This plant is called the Welwitschia,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
and it lives only in parts of coastal Namibia and Angola,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
where it's uniquely adapted

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
to collect moisture from mist coming off the sea.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
And what's more, it's actually a tree.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
It's a primitive conifer.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
You'll notice that it's bearing cones down the center.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
And what looks like two big heaps of leaves,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
is actually two single leaves

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
that get shredded up

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
by the harsh desert conditions over time.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
And it actually never sheds those leaves,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
so it also bears the distinction

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
of having the longest leaves

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
in the plant kingdom.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
I spoke to a biologist

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
at the Kirstenbosch Botanical Garden in Capetown

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
to ask him

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
where he thought this remarkable plant came from,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
and his thought was that

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
if you travel around Namibia,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
you see that there are a number of petrified forests,

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
and the logs are all --

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
the logs are all giant coniferous trees,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
and yet there's no sign of where they might have come from.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
So his thought was that

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
flooding in the north of Africa

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
actually brought those coniferous trees down

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
tens of thousands of years ago,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
and what resulted was this remarkable adaptation

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
to this unique desert environment.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
This is what I think is the most poetic of the oldest living things.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
This is something called an underground forest.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
So, I spoke to a botanist at the Pretoria Botanical Garden,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
who explained that certain species of trees

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
have adapted to this region.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
It's bushfelt region,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
which is dry and prone to a lot of fires,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
as so what these trees have done

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
is, if you can imagine that this is the crown of the tree,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
and that this is ground level,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
imagine that the whole thing,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
that whole bulk of the tree,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
migrated underground,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
and you just have those leaves peeping up above the surface.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
That way, when a fire roars through,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
it's the equivalent of getting your eyebrows singed.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
The tree can easily recover.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
These also tend to grow clonally,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
the oldest of which is 13,000 years old.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Back in the U.S., there's a couple plants of similar age.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
This is the clonal Creosote bush,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
which is around 12,000 years old.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
If you've been in the American West,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
you know the Creosote bush is pretty ubiquitous,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
but that being said, you see that this has

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
this unique, circular form.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
And what's happening is it's expanding slowly outwards

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
from that original shape.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
And it's one -- again, that interconnected root system,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
making it one genetically identical individual.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
It also has a friend nearby --

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
well, I think they're friends.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
This is the clonal Mojave yucca, it's about a mile away,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
and it's a little bit older than 12,000 years.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
And you see it has that similar circular form.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And there's some younger clones

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
dotting the landscape behind it.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And both of these, the yucca and the Creosote bush,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
live on Bureau of Land Management land,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
and that's very different from being protected in a national park.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
In fact, this land is designated

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
for recreational all-terrain vehicle use.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
So, now I want to show what very well might be

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
the oldest living thing on the planet.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
This is Siberian Actinobacteria,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
which is between 400,000

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000
and 600,000 years old.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
This bacteria was discovered several years ago

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
by a team of planetary biologists

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
hoping to find clues to life on other planets

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
by looking at one of the harshest conditions on ours.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
And what they found, by doing research into the permafrost,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
was this bacteria.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
But what's unique about it is that

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
it's doing DNA repair below freezing.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
And what that means is that it's not dormant --

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
it's actually been living and growing

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
for half a million years.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
It's also probably one the most vulnerable

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
of the oldest living things,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
because if the permafrost melts,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
it won't survive.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
This is a map that I've put together of the oldest living things,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
so you can get a sense of where they are; you see they're all over the world.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
The blue flags represent things that I've already photographed,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
and the reds are places that I'm still trying to get to.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
You'll see also, there's a flag on Antarctica.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
I'm trying to travel there

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
to find 5,000 year-old moss,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
which lives on the Antarctic Peninsula.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
So, I probably have about two more years left

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
on this project --

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
on this phase of the project,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
but after five years,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
I really feel like I know what's at the heart of this work.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
The oldest living things in the world

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
are a record and celebration of our past,

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
a call to action in the present

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
and a barometer of our future.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
They've survived for millennia

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
in desert, in the permafrost,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000
at the tops of mountains and at the bottom of the ocean.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
They've withstood

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
untold natural perils and human encroachments,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
but now some of them are in jeopardy,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
and they can't just get up and get out of the way.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
It's my hope that, by going to find these organisms,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
that I can help draw attention

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
to their remarkable resilience

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
and help play a part in insuring

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
their continued longevity into the foreseeable future.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Thank you.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000
(Applause)
