00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The moment I say "school,"

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
so many memories come back to me.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It's like after every exam,
when I walk out,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
the teacher would say, "Hey, come.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
How did you do?"

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I would say with a great smile,
"I will definitely pass."

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And I didn't understand why,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
in one hand they say, "Speak the truth,"

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.762
in the other hand, when you say
the truth, they hated you.

00:00:22.786 --> 00:00:24.000
So it went on like that,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and I didn't know where
else to find myself.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So I remember those nights

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I used to go to sleep

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
with asking help from [the] Unknown

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
because, for some reason,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.096
I couldn't believe
what my father and mother

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.000
hanged in the Puja room as a god,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
because my friend's family

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
had something else as a god.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.334
So I thought, "I guess
I'll pray to [the] Unknown

00:00:47.358 --> 00:00:50.000
and ask help,"

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and started getting help from everywhere,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
each and every corner
of my life at that time.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.239
My brothers started giving me
a few tips about drawing and painting.

00:00:59.263 --> 00:01:02.000
Then, when I was in eighth standard

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
around 13 years old,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
I started working in a part-time job

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
in one of the signboard
artists called Putu.

00:01:12.952 --> 00:01:15.000
And then school also
started supporting me.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
"Oh, he's bad at studies,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
but let him send
to the drawing competitions."

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So it was good to survive
with that little tool

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
that I found to find
my own place in school.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And one of those competitions,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I just won a small,
little transistor Philips radio.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And I didn't have the patience to wait

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
until I reached home.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.048
So I just switched
on in the train, loudly.

00:01:38.072 --> 00:01:40.000
If you travel in Indian trains,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
you can see people listening to radio

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and, you know, even from their mobiles.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
So at that time -- and I was 13 --

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and I was listening to just radio,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and someone happened to sit next to me,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
like these three people are sitting here.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
You know, like just adjacent to me.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.334
He just started asking, "Where did
you buy the radio? How much is it?"

00:01:58.358 --> 00:02:01.000
I said, "It's a prize
from [an] art competition."

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And he said, "Oh, I teach
at a college of arts.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I think

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
you should study in a school of art.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
You just quit school and come there."

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
So, why I'm telling you this,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
you know, maybe, you know,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.572
whoever is sitting next to you can
change your whole life -- it's possible.

00:02:17.596 --> 00:02:20.596
It is that we need we need
to be open and fine-tuned.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
So that's what made me enter

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
[the] college of arts after three attempts

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and just continue to inquire

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
what I really want to do
with art work, or art

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
and finally I'm here in front of you.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
When I look back, you know,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
on what happened between that time

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and now here --

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
the last 10/15 years --

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I can see that most of the works

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
revolve around three subjects,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
but it was not intentional.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And I just start out with a trace
because I was thinking,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
"What really makes us?" -- you know,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
it's actually [the] past,
what makes a person.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
So I was thinking,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
but when you look at the past,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
the way to understand the past

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
is only by the traces available,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
because we cannot go back [to] the past.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
It can be ruins, or it can be music,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
or it can be painting or drawing
or writing, whatever it is.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
But it is just a kind
of trace of that time.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And that fascinated me,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
to explore that territory.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
So I was working on the line,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
but instead of working about traces,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
I started capturing traces.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
So here are some of the works
I would like to show you.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
So this is called "Self In Progress."

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
It's just a trace of being in this body.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
So here, what happened then,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
you know -- what I really enjoyed the most

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
is that this sculpture

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
is nothing but a trace of myself.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
It's almost like a 3D photograph.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
So there is an element of performance,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
and there is an element of sculpture,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.334
and there is an element of feeling
one's self, so close to one's self.

00:04:03.358 --> 00:04:06.000
So it's almost like fossils
for the future.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
And then moved slowly

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
to explore the other possibilities
of capturing traces.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
So this is what I was talking
about, while molding,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
it's such a great experience,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
because we have freedom of like walking,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
or moving my hand or,
moving around in the space,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
but the moment this becomes solid,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
when you cannot move even an inch,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.667
because this is plaster of Paris, so
the moment you pour it it's like liquid;

00:04:33.691 --> 00:04:36.691
but after 20 minutes,
it's almost like a hard stone.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
So this is capturing
the trace of a thumbprint

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
because, knowingly or unknowingly,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
whatever we do, you know,
we leave our traces here.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
So I just thought, "I'm going to capture

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
thumbprint, footprint,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
or whatever traces we leave as humans."

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
This is the trace of fire,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
this is the trace of sun.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.191
Because when I was capturing
traces, you know,

00:05:02.215 --> 00:05:05.000
this thought comes to me always:

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
is it, only when the object touches
the thing and it leaves the trace,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
or is there other ways to capture it?"

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
So this work is nothing but like --

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
because of the focal length of the lens,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
it just shows what is on the other side.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.096
So I just put the paper
on the focal length,

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.000
which was an etching print,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
then I got the portrait
of [the] sun from sunlight.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
This is called "Dawn to Dawn."

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
What I did here, I just put
like 10 feet [of] paper

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
then put a coconut rope,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
and just burnt it.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.048
So it took about 24
hours to get this line.

00:05:37.048 --> 00:05:39.048
So wherever the fire is eating the paper,

00:05:39.048 --> 00:05:41.000
that's what becomes the work --

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
detail.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Even though we have traces

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
when we try to understand them,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
the perception and context

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
play a major role to understand it.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
So do we really understand what it is,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
or are we trying to get

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
what we think it is?

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.096
Then move towards questioning
the perception

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.000
because, even though there are traces,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.048
when you try to understand them,
you know you play a major role.

00:06:11.072 --> 00:06:13.000
So like let's say even a simple act.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
How many of you saw
a cow crossing in India

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.239
while you were coming
from Bangalore to Mysore?

00:06:18.263 --> 00:06:21.000
Can you just raise the hand?

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
If you just ask an opinion

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
of how, everyone can interpret it.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Like, let's say, if a schoolteacher says,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.191
she'll simply say, "To
get to the other side."

00:06:30.215 --> 00:06:33.000
Why the cow was crossing
the road, you know.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
The answer can be so
different if Potter said it.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
He would say, "For the greater good."

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Martin Luther King would say,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
"I imagine a world where
all cows will be free

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
to cross the road,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
without having their motives
called into question."

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
(Laughter)

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Imagine Moses comes now, and he sees

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
the same cow walking around the street.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
He would definitely say,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
"God came down from heaven,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
and he said unto the cow,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
'Thou shalt cross the road.'

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And cow crossed the road,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
and there was much
rejoicing as a holy cow."

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
(Laughter)

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Freud would say,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
"The fact that you're at all concerned

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
reveals your underlying
sexual insecurity."

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
(Laughter)

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
If we ask Einstein,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
he would say, "Whether
the cow crossed the road,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
or the road moved underneath the cow,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
depends on your frame of reference."

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
(Laughter)

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Or Buddha --

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
if he saw the same cow, he would say,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
"Asking this question denies
your own nature [as a] cow."

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
(Laughter)

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
So, what we see

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
is just what we think often,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
and most of the time,
we don't see what it is.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
It just all depends on one's perception.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
And context, what is really context?

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
You know, I could just show you
this little piece of paper.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Because I always think meaning
doesn't really exist.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.762
The meaning of what we create
in this world doesn't exist.

00:08:08.786 --> 00:08:11.000
It's just created by the mind.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
If you look at this piece of paper,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
this is the breadth

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
and this is called length.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
This is how we've been taught in school.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
But if you tear it in the middle --

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
now, I didn't touch this breadth,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
but still, the meaning of this changes.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
So what we conceive as a meaning

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
is always not there;

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
it's on the other side,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
even when we say dark, light,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
good, bad, tall, short --

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
all meaning it doesn't exist in reality.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
It's just that being a human,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
the way we train to perceive the reality

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
creates this meaning.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
So this work from this period

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
is mostly like --

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.429
you know, this is a work
called "Light Makes Dark."

00:08:55.453 --> 00:08:58.000
It's just captured through from the lamp.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.239
So the lamp is not just giving
a light, it's also giving a darkness.

00:09:01.263 --> 00:09:04.263
So this is a work of art,
which is just trying to explore that.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
This is called "Limit Out."

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
This shows how limited our eye
or hearing sense or touch --

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
do we really see?

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
This is an exact negative.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
It's about six inches deep in the wall,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
but it just appears
like it's coming out of the wall.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
You know the wall is almost like --

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.239
this is the first skin,
and this is the second,

00:09:26.239 --> 00:09:28.525
and there's a third,
and each creates a meaning.

00:09:28.549 --> 00:09:31.000
And we're just pulling
the wall off the gallery.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Again, "Inward Out."

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
It's a full-figure cast from myself.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
It's about eight inches deep.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
When I was doing that, I always wondered
since I've worked with creators --

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
and now you know, I've moved
to questioning the perception --

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
whenever I see the bird flying in the sky,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
it just makes me feel like:

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
is there anything behind,
are there any traces up there,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
which as a human, we don't see them?

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Is there any way to capture the thought

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
into visual art?

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
I couldn't find it.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
But a solution arrived

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
after being quiet and not working
for about six, seven months,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
in the restroom,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
when I was changing the air freshener

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
that goes from solid substance to vapor.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
It's called Odonil.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
This is the work I made
out of that material.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.667
The process to get to make
the sculpture was interesting,

00:10:29.691 --> 00:10:31.000
because I wrote to Balsara,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
who produces that air
freshener called Odonil,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
saying, "Dear Sir, I am an artist.
This is my catalogue.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Will you help me to make this sculpture?"

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
They never wrote back to me.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Then I thought, "I will go
to the Small Scale Industries

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Facilitating Unit and ask help."

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
So I told them, "I'd like to start
an air freshener company."

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
They said, "Of course.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
This is the fee for the project report,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.524
and we will give you
all the details," and they gave.

00:10:54.548 --> 00:10:57.000
Finally, I went back to them and said,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.143
"It's not for starting the company,
it's just to make my own work.

00:11:00.167 --> 00:11:02.000
Please come for the show."

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
And they did.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
And this work is in the Devi
Art Foundation in Delhi.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
In India, nobody really
talks about works of art;

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
they always talk
about the appreciation of art.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
You buy this for 3,000 rupees,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
it'll become 30,000 in two months.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
This is the craft that was going on,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
but there are a few collectors

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
who also collect art which can depreciate.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And this was collected by Anupam --

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.905
which is like, finally in the end,
he will not have anything,

00:11:27.929 --> 00:11:29.929
because it will evaporate.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
So this is after a few weeks,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
this is after a few months.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
It's just all about questioning
the preconceptions.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
So if someone says, "Oh,
I see the portrait,"

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.191
it may not be the portrait
after a few months.

00:11:44.215 --> 00:11:46.000
And if they say it's solid,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
it will not be solid, it will evaporate.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
And if they say they don't get it,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
that's also not true,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
because it's in the air.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.239
It's in the same gallery
or in the same museum.

00:11:57.263 --> 00:11:59.000
So they inhaled it,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
but they are not aware of it.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
While I was doing that work,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
my mom and my dad,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
they were looking at it and they said,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
"Why do you deal with negative
subjects all the time?"

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
And I was like, "What do you mean?"

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
"Light makes dark and now
evaporating self.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Don't you think it remained
something about death," they said.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
"Of course not. For me," I'm thinking,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
"this is tucked in some small solid,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
but the moment it evaporates,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
it's merged with the whole."

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
But she said, "No. Still, I don't like it.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Can you make something from nothing

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
as a sculptor?"

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
I said, "No, mom. It can't be.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Because we can create

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
a sculpture

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
by gathering dust together,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
or we can break the sculpture
and get the dust,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
but there is nowhere that we can
bring dust into the universe."

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
So, I did this work for her.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
It's called "Emerging Angel."

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
This is the first day --

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
it just gives the appearance

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
that one is becoming the other.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
So, the same sculpture

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
after a few days.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
This is after 15/20 days.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Through that small little slit

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
between the glass box and the wood,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.048
the air goes underneath the sculpture
and creates the other one.

00:13:15.072 --> 00:13:17.000
This gave me a greater faith.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
That evaporating sculpture
gave me a greater faith

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.048
that maybe there
is many more possibilities

00:13:22.072 --> 00:13:24.000
to capture [the] invisible.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
So what you see now

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
is called "Shadow Foreshadow."

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
And what I'd like to tell you

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
is we don't see shadow,
and we don't see light too;

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
we see the source of the light.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.143
We see where it's bouncing,
but we don't see [them] as they exist.

00:13:39.167 --> 00:13:42.000
You know, that's why the night
sky, we see the sky as dark,

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
but it's filled with light all the time.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
When it's bounced on the moon, we see it.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
The same thing in the darkroom.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
The little dust particle
will again, reflect the light,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
and we realize the existence of light.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
So we don't see dark, we don't see light,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
we don't see gravity,
we don't see electricity.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
So, I just started doing this work

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
to inquire further

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
about how to sculpt

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
the space between this object and there.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.334
Because, as a visual artist, if I'm
seeing this and I'm seeing that --

00:14:13.358 --> 00:14:16.000
but how to sculpt this, you know?

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
If we sculpt this, this
has two reference points.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
The skin of this is also
representing this.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
And skin at the other end
also represents the floor.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
I did this as an experiment

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
of casting the shadow.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
So this is a corrugated
box and its shadow.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Then the second one --

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
the moment you bring any invisible
into the visible world

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
it will have all the characteristics
of the visible existence.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
So that produced a shadow.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Then I thought, okay, let me sculpt that.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Then, again, that becomes an object.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Again, throwing light, then the third one.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
So what you see is nothing but shadow

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
of a shadow of a shadow.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
And then again, at that point,
there is no shadow.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
I thought, "Oh, good. Work is finished."

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
You can see the detail.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
This is called "Gravity."

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
It's called "Breath." It's just
two holes on the gallery wall.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
It's a false wall, which contains

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
like 110 cubic feet.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
So that hole actually

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
makes the air come out and go in.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
So where it's happening, we can see,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.334
but what is happening
will remain invisible only.

00:15:30.334 --> 00:15:33.334
This is from the show called
"Invisible," at Talwar Gallery.

00:15:33.334 --> 00:15:35.000
This is called "Kaayam."

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Detail.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
And what I'd like to tell you,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
our senses are so limited --

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
we cannot hear everything,
we cannot see everything.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
We don't feel, "I am touching the air,"

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
but if the breeze is a little more
faster, then I can feel it.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
So all of our construction of reality

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
is through these limited senses.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
So my request was like,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
is there any way to use all this

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
as just a symbol or a sign?

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
And to really get to the point,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000
we should move beyond, you know,

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.239
go to the other side
of the wall, like illogic,

00:16:12.263 --> 00:16:14.000
like are invisible.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Because when we see someone
walks, we see the footprint.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
But if we're just cutting that footprint
from the whole thing and trying to analyze it,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
you will miss the point

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
because the actual journey happens
between those footprints,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.286
and the footprints are nothing
but passing time.

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:28.000
Thank you.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
(Applause)
