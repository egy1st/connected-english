00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
My story is a little bit about war.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
It's about disillusionment.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
It's about death.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And it's about rediscovering

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
idealism

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
in all of that wreckage.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And perhaps also, there's a lesson

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
about how to deal with

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
our screwed-up, fragmenting

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and dangerous world of the 21st century.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I don't believe in straightforward narratives.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I don't believe in a life or history

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
written as decision "A" led to consequence "B"

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
led to consequence "C" --

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
these neat narratives that we're presented with,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and that perhaps we encourage in each other.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I believe in randomness,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and one of the reasons I believe that

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
is because me becoming a diplomat was random.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
I'm colorblind.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I was born unable to see most colors.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
This is why I wear gray and black most of the time,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and I have to take my wife with me

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
to chose clothes.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And I'd always wanted to be a fighter pilot when I was a boy.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I loved watching planes barrel over

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
our holiday home in the countryside.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And it was my boyhood dream to be a fighter pilot.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And I did the tests in the Royal Air Force to become a pilot,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and sure enough, I failed.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I couldn't see all the blinking different lights,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and I can't distinguish color.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
So I had to choose another career,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and this was in fact relatively easy for me,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
because I had an abiding passion all the way through my childhood,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
which was international relations.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
As a child,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I read the newspaper thoroughly.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I was fascinated by the Cold War,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
by the INF negotiations

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
over intermediate-range nuclear missiles,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
the proxy war between the Soviet Union and the U.S.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
in Angola or Afghanistan.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
These things really interested me.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And so I decided quite at an early age

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
I wanted to be a diplomat.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And I, one day, I announced this to my parents --

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and my father denies this story to this day --

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I said, "Daddy, I want to be a diplomat."

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
And he turned to me, and he said,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
"Carne, you have to be very clever to be a diplomat."

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
(Laughter)

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And my ambition was sealed.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
In 1989,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I entered the British Foreign Service.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
That year, 5,000 people applied to become a diplomat,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and 20 of us succeeded.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And as those numbers suggest,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
I was inducted into an elite

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and fascinating and exhilarating world.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Being a diplomat, then and now,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
is an incredible job, and I loved every minute of it --

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I enjoyed the status of it.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I bought myself a nice suit and wore leather-soled shoes

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and reveled in

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
this amazing access I had to world events.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
I traveled to the Gaza Strip.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
I headed the Middle East Peace Process section

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
in the British Foreign Ministry.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I became a speechwriter

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
for the British Foreign Secretary.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
I met Yasser Arafat.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
I negotiated

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
with Saddam's diplomats at the U.N.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Later, I traveled to Kabul

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
and served in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And I would travel

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
in a C-130 transport

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
and go and visit warlords

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
in mountain hideaways

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
and negotiate with them

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
about how we were going to eradicate Al Qaeda from Afghanistan,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
surrounded by my Special Forces escort,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
who, themselves, had to have an escort of a platoon of Royal Marines,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
because it was so dangerous.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
And that was exciting -- that was fun.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
It was really interesting.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And it's a great cadre of people,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
incredibly close-knit community of people.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And the pinnacle of my career, as it turned out,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
was when I was posted to New York.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
I'd already served in Germany, Norway,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
various other places,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
but I was posted to New York

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
to serve on the U.N. Security Council for the British delegation.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
And my responsibility was the Middle East,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
which was my specialty.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
And there, I dealt with things

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
like the Middle East peace process,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
the Lockerbie issue --

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
we can talk about that later, if you wish --

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
but above all, my responsibility was Iraq

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
and its weapons of mass destruction

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
and the sanctions we placed on Iraq

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
to oblige it to disarm itself of these weapons.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
I was the chief British negotiator

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
on the subject,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
and I was steeped in the issue.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And anyway,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
my tour -- it was kind of a very exciting time.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
I mean it was very dramatic diplomacy.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
We went through several wars

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
during my time in New York.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
I negotiated for my country

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
the resolution in the Security Council

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
of the 12th of September 2001

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
condemning the attacks of the day before,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
which were, of course, deeply present to us

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
actually living in New York at the time.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
So it was kind of the best of time, worst of times

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
kind of experience.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
I lived the high-life.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Although I worked very long hours,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
I lived in a penthouse in Union Square.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
I was a single British diplomat in New York City;

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
you can imagine what that might have meant.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
(Laughter)

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
I had a good time.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
But in 2002,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
when my tour came to an end,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
I decided I wasn't going to go back

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
to the job that was waiting for me in London.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
I decided to take a sabbatical,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
in fact, at the New School, Bruce.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
In some inchoate, inarticulate way

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
I realized that there was something wrong

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
with my work, with me.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
I was exhausted,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
and I was also disillusioned

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
in a way I couldn't quite put my finger on.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
And I decided to take some time out from work.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
The Foreign Office was very generous.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
You could take these special unpaid leave, as they called them,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and yet remain part of the diplomatic service, but not actually do any work.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
It was nice.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
And eventually, I decided

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
to take a secondment to join the U.N. in Kosovo,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
which was then under U.N. administration.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And two things happened in Kosovo,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
which kind of, again,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
shows the randomness of life,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
because these things turned out to be

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
two of the pivots of my life

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
and helped to deliver me to the next stage.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
But they were random things.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
One was that, in the summer of 2004,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
the British government, somewhat reluctantly,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
decided to have an official inquiry

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
into the use of intelligence on WMD

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
in the run up to the Iraq War,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
a very limited subject.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And I testified to that inquiry in secret.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
I had been steeped in the intelligence on Iraq

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
and its WMD,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
and my testimony to the inquiry said three things:

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
that the government exaggerated the intelligence,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
which was very clear in all the years I'd read it.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And indeed, our own internal assessment was very clear

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
that Iraq's WMD

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
did not pose a threat to its neighbors, let alone to us.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Secondly, the government had ignored all available alternatives to war,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
which in some ways

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
was a more discreditable thing still.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
The third reason, I won't go into.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
But anyway, I gave that testimony,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
and that presented me with a crisis.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
What was I going to do?

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
This testimony was deeply critical of my colleagues,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
of my ministers, who had, in my view

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
had perpetrated a war on a falsehood.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
And so I was in crisis.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
And this wasn't a pretty thing.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
I moaned about it, I hesitated,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
I went on and on and on to my long-suffering wife,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
and eventually I decided to resign from the British Foreign Service.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
I felt -- there's a scene in the Al Pacino movie "The Insider," which you may know,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
where he goes back to CBS

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
after they've let him down over the tobacco guy,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
and he goes, "You know, I just can't do this anymore. Something's broken."

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
And it was like that for me. I love that movie.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
I felt just something's broken.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
I can't actually sit with my foreign minister

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
or my prime minister again with a smile on my face

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
and do what I used to do gladly for them.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
So took a running leap

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
and jumped over the edge of a cliff.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
And it was a very, very uncomfortable, unpleasant feeling.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
And I started to fall.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
And today, that fall hasn't stopped;

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
I'm still falling.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
But, in a way, I've got used to the sensation of it.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
And in a way, I kind of like

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
the sensation of it a lot better

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
than I like actually standing on top of the cliff,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
wondering what to do.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
A second thing happened in Kosovo,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
which kind of -- I need a quick gulp of water, forgive me.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
A second thing happened in Kosovo,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
which kind of delivered the answer,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
which I couldn't really answer,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
which is, "What do I do with my life?"

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
I love diplomacy --

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
I have no career --

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
I expected my entire life to be a diplomat, to be serving my country.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
I wanted to be an ambassador,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
and my mentors, my heroes,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
people who got to the top of my profession,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
and here I was throwing it all away.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
A lot of my friends were still in it.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
My pension was in it.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
And I gave it up.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
And what was I going to do?

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And that year, in Kosovo,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
this terrible, terrible thing happened, which I saw.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
In March 2004, there were terrible riots

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
all over the province -- as it then was -- of Kosovo.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
18 people were killed.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
It was anarchy.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
And it's a very horrible thing to see anarchy,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
to know that the police and the military --

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
there were lots of military troops there --

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
actually can't stop that rampaging mob

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
who's coming down the street.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And the only way that rampaging mob coming down the street will stop

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
is when they decide to stop

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
and when they've had enough burning and killing.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
And that is not a very nice feeling to see, and I saw it.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
And I went through it. I went through those mobs.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
And with my Albanian friends, we tried to stop it, but we failed.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
And that riot taught me something,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
which isn't immediately obvious and it's kind of a complicated story.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
But one of the reasons that riot took place --

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
those riots, which went on for several days, took place --

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
was because the Kosovo people

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
were disenfranchised from their own future.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
There were diplomatic negotiations about the future of Kosovo

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
going on then,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
and the Kosovo government, let alone the Kosovo people,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
were not actually

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
participating in those talks.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
There was this whole fancy diplomatic system,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
this negotiation process about the future of Kosovo,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
and the Kosovars weren't part of it.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
And funnily enough, they were frustrated about that.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Those riots were part of the manifestation of that frustration.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
It wasn't the only reason,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
and life is not simple, one reason narratives.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
It was a complicated thing,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
and I'm not pretending it was more simple than it was.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
But that was one of the reasons.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
And that kind of gave me the inspiration --

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
or rather to be precise,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
it gave my wife the inspiration.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
She said, "Why don't you advise the Kosovars?

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Why don't you advise their government on their diplomacy?"

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
And the Kosovars were not allowed a diplomatic service.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
They were not allowed diplomats.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
They were not allowed a foreign office

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
to help them deal with this immensely complicated process,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
which became known as the Final Status Process of Kosovo.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
And so that was the idea.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
That was the origin of the thing that became Independent Diplomat,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
the world's first diplomatic advisory group

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
and a non-profit to boot.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
And it began when I flew back from London

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
after my time at the U.N. in Kosovo.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
I flew back and had dinner with the Kosovo prime minister and said to him,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
"Look, I'm proposing that I come and advise you on the diplomacy.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
I know this stuff. It's what I do. Why don't I come and help you?"

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
And he raised his glass of raki to me and said,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
"Yes, Carne. Come."

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
And I came to Kosovo

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
and advised the Kosovo government.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Independent Diplomat ended up advising three successive Kosovo prime ministers

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
and the multi-party negotiation team of Kosovo.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
And Kosovo became independent.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Independent Diplomat is now established

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
in five diplomatic centers around the world,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
and we're advising seven or eight

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
different countries, or political groups,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
depending on how you wish to define them --

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
and I'm not big on definitions.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
We're advising the Northern Cypriots on how to reunify their island.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
We're advising the Burmese opposition,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
the government of Southern Sudan,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
which -- you heard it here first --

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
is going to be a new country within the next few years.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
We're advising the Polisario Front of the Western Sahara,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
who are fighting to get their country back

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
from Moroccan occupation

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
after 34 years of dispossession.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
We're advising various island states in the climate change negotiations,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
which is suppose to culminate

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
in Copenhagen.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
There's a bit of randomness here too

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
because, when I was beginning Independent Diplomat,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
I went to a party in the House of Lords,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
which is a ridiculous place,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
but I was holding my drink like this, and I bumped into

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
this guy who was standing behind me.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
And we started talking, and he said --

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
I told him what I was doing,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
and I told him rather grandly

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
I was going to establish Independent Diplomat in New York.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
At that time there was just me --

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
and me and my wife were moving back to New York.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
And he said, "Why don't you see my colleagues in New York?"

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
And it turned out

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
he worked for an innovation company called ?What If!,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
which some of you have probably heard of.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
And one thing led to another,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
and I ended up having a desk

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
in ?What If! in New York,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
when I started Independent Diplomat.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
And watching ?What If!

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
develop new flavors of chewing gum for Wrigley

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
or new flavors for Coke

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
actually helped me innovate

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
new strategies for the Kosovars

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
and for the Saharawis of the Western Sahara.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
And I began to realize that there are different ways of doing diplomacy --

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
that diplomacy, like business,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
is a business of solving problems,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
and yet the word innovation doesn't exist in diplomacy;

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
it's all zero sum games and realpolitik

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
and ancient institutions that have been there for generations

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
and do things the same way they've always done things.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
And Independent Diplomat, today,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
tries to incorporate some of the things I learned at ?What If!.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
We all sit in one office and shout at each other across the office.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
We all work on little laptops and try to move desks to change the way we think.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
And we use naive experts

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
who may know nothing about the countries we're dealing with,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
but may know something about something else

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
to try to inject new thinking

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
into the problems

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
that we try to address for our clients.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
It's not easy, because our clients, by definition,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
are having a difficult time, diplomatically.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
There are, I don't know,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
some lessons from all of this,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
personal and political --

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
and in a way, they're the same thing.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
The personal one

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
is falling off a cliff

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
is actually a good thing, and I recommend it.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
And it's a good thing to do at least once in your life

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
just to tear everything up and jump.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
The second thing is a bigger lesson about the world today.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
Independent Diplomat is part of a trend

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
which is emerging and evident across the world,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
which is that the world is fragmenting.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
States mean less than they used to,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
and the power of the state is declining.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
That means the power of others things is rising.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Those other things are called non-state actors.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
They may be corporations,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
they may be mafiosi, they may be nice NGOs,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
they may anything,

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
any number of things.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
We are living in a more complicated and fragmented world.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
If governments are less able

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
to affect the problems

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
that affect us in the world,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
then that means, who is left to deal with them,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
who has to take greater responsibility to deal with them?

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
Us.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
If they can't do it, who's left to deal with it?

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
We have no choice but to embrace that reality.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
What this means is

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
it's no longer good enough

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
to say that international relations, or global affairs,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
or chaos in Somalia,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
or what's going on in Burma is none of your business,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
and that you can leave it to governments to get on with.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
I can connect any one of you

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
by six degrees of separation

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
to the Al-Shabaab militia in Somalia.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Ask me how later, particularly if you eat fish, interestingly enough,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
but that connection is there.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
We are all intimately connected.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
And this isn't just Tom Friedman,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
it's actually provable in case after case after case.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
What that means is, instead of asking your politicians to do things,

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
you have to look to yourself to do things.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
And Independent Diplomat is a kind of example of this

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
in a sort of loose way.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
There aren't neat examples, but one example is this:

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
the way the world is changing

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
is embodied in what's going on at the place I used to work --

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
the U.N. Security Council.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
The U.N. was established in 1945.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Its charter is basically designed

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
to stop conflicts between states --

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
interstate conflict.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Today, 80 percent of the agenda

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
of the U.N. Security Council

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
is about conflicts within states,

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
involving non-state parties --

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
guerillas, separatists,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
terrorists, if you want to call them that,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
people who are not normal governments, who are not normal states.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
That is the state of the world today.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
When I realized this,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
and when I look back on my time at the Security Council

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
and what happened with the Kosovars,

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
and I realize that often

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
the people who were most directly affected

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
by what we were doing in the Security Council

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
weren't actually there, weren't actually invited

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
to give their views to the Security Council,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
I thought, this is wrong.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
Something's got to be done about this.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
So I started off in a traditional mode.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Me and my colleagues at Independent Diplomat

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
went around the U.N. Security Council.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
We went around 70 U.N. member states --

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
the Kazaks, the Ethiopians, the Israelis --

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
you name them, we went to see them --

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
the secretary general, all of them,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
and said, "This is all wrong.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
This is terrible that you don't consult these people who are actually affected.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
You've got to institutionalize a system

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
where you actually invite the Kosovars

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
to come and tell you what they think.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
This will allow you to tell me -- you can tell them what you think.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
It'll be great. You can have an exchange.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000
You can actually incorporate these people's views into your decisions,

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
which means your decisions will be more effective and durable."

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
Super-logical, you would think.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
I mean, incredibly logical. So obvious, anybody could get it.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
And of course, everybody got it. Everybody went, "Yes, of course, you're absolutely right.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
Come back to us

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
in maybe six months."

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
And of course, nothing happened -- nobody did anything.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
The Security Council does its business

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
in exactly the same way today

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
that it did X number of years ago,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
when I was there 10 years ago.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
So we looked at that observation

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
of basically failure

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
and thought, what can we do about it.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
And I thought, I'm buggered

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
if I'm going to spend the rest of my life

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
lobbying for these crummy governments

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
to do what needs to be done.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
So what we're going to do

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
is we're actually going to set up these meetings ourselves.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
So now, Independent Diplomat

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
is in the process of setting up meetings

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
between the U.N. Security Council

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
and the parties to the disputes

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000
that are on the agenda of the Security Council.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
So we will be bringing

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000
Darfuri rebel groups,

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
the Northern Cypriots and the Southern Cypriots,

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
rebels from Aceh,

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
and awful long laundry list

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000
of chaotic conflicts around the world.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
And we will be trying to bring the parties to New York

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
to sit down in a quiet room

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
in a private setting with no press

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
and actually explain what they want

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
to the members of the U. N. Security Council,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
and for the members of the U.N. Security Council

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
to explain to them what they want.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
So there's actually a conversation,

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
which has never before happened.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
And of course, describing all this,

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
any of you who know politics will think this is incredibly difficult,

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
and I entirely agree with you.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
The chances of failure are very high,

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000
but it certainly won't happen

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000
if we don't try to make it happen.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
And my politics has changed fundamentally

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
from when I was a diplomat to what I am today,

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000
and I think that outputs is what matters, not process,

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
not technology, frankly, so much either.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Preach technology

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000
to all the Twittering members of all the Iranian demonstrations

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000
who are now in political prison in Tehran,

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
where Ahmadinejad remains in power.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000
Technology has not delivered political change in Iran.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000
You've got to look at the outputs, and you got to say to yourself,

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
"What can I do to produce that particular output?"

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
That is the politics of the 21st century,

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
and in a way, Independent Diplomat

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
embodies that fragmentation, that change,

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
that is happening to all of us.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
That's my story. Thanks.
