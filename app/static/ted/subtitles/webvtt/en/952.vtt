WEBVTT

00:00:00.253 --> 00:00:02.183
I am a cultural omnivore,

00:00:02.207 --> 00:00:06.843
one whose daily commute is made possible
by attachment to an iPod --

00:00:06.867 --> 00:00:09.096
an iPod that contains Wagner and Mozart,

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.136
pop diva Christina Aguilera,

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.776
country singer Josh Turner,

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.235
gangsta rap artist Kirk Franklin,

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:17.632
concerti, symphonies and more and more.

00:00:17.656 --> 00:00:19.170
I'm a voracious reader,

00:00:19.194 --> 00:00:22.125
a reader who deals with Ian McEwan
down to Stephanie Meyer.

00:00:22.149 --> 00:00:25.354
I have read the Twilight tetralogy.

00:00:25.378 --> 00:00:27.796
And one who lives for my home theater,

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.799
a home theater where I devour
DVDs, video on demand

00:00:30.823 --> 00:00:32.213
and a lot of television.

00:00:32.237 --> 00:00:35.618
For me, "Law &amp; Order: SVU,"
Tina Fey and "30 Rock"

00:00:35.642 --> 00:00:37.214
and "Judge Judy" --

00:00:37.238 --> 00:00:40.635
"The people are real, the cases are real,
the rulings are final."

00:00:40.659 --> 00:00:41.671
(Laughter)

00:00:41.695 --> 00:00:44.976
Now, I'm convinced a lot of you
probably share my passions,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.287
especially my passion for "Judge Judy,"

00:00:47.311 --> 00:00:50.801
and you'd fight anybody
who attempted to take her away from us,

00:00:50.825 --> 00:00:54.565
but I'm a little less convinced that you
share the central passion of my life,

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:57.302
a passion for the live
professional performing arts,

00:00:57.326 --> 00:01:00.308
performing arts that represent
the orchestral repertoire, yes,

00:01:00.332 --> 00:01:02.976
but jazz as well, modern dance, opera,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.976
theater and more and more and more.

00:01:05.848 --> 00:01:08.976
Frankly, it's a sector that many of us
who work in the field

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.725
worry is being endangered
and possibly dismantled by technology.

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:17.139
While we initially heralded the Internet
as the fantastic new marketing device

00:01:17.163 --> 00:01:19.382
that was going to solve all our problems,

00:01:19.406 --> 00:01:21.803
we now realize that the Internet
is, if anything,

00:01:21.827 --> 00:01:23.446
too effective in that regard.

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.976
Depending on who you read,
an arts organization

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.466
or an artist, who tries
to attract the attention

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.711
of a potential single ticket buyer,

00:01:30.735 --> 00:01:35.976
now competes with between three and 5,000
different marketing messages

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.494
a typical citizen sees every single day.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.977
We now know, in fact,

00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:43.768
that technology is our biggest
competitor for leisure time.

00:01:43.792 --> 00:01:45.043
Five years ago,

00:01:45.067 --> 00:01:49.776
Gen Xers spent 20.7 hours online and TV,
the majority on TV.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.635
Gen Yers spent even more --

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.221
23.8 hours, the majority online.

00:01:54.626 --> 00:02:00.261
And now, a typical university-entering
student arrives at college

00:02:00.285 --> 00:02:04.596
already having spent 20,000 hours online

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.956
and an additional 10,000 hours
playing video games --

00:02:08.456 --> 00:02:11.674
a stark reminder that we operate
in a cultural context

00:02:11.698 --> 00:02:16.471
where video games now outsell
music and movie recordings combined.

00:02:17.905 --> 00:02:20.660
Moreover, we're afraid that technology

00:02:20.684 --> 00:02:23.723
has altered our very assumptions
of cultural consumption.

00:02:23.747 --> 00:02:24.911
Thanks to the Internet,

00:02:24.935 --> 00:02:27.909
we believe we can get anything
we want whenever we want it,

00:02:27.933 --> 00:02:29.752
delivered to our own doorstep.

00:02:29.776 --> 00:02:32.320
We can shop at three in the morning
or eight at night,

00:02:32.344 --> 00:02:35.277
ordering jeans tailor-made
for our unique body types.

00:02:35.301 --> 00:02:39.227
Expectations of personalization
and customization

00:02:39.251 --> 00:02:41.100
that the live performing arts --

00:02:41.124 --> 00:02:43.976
which have set curtain times, set venues,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.374
attendant inconveniences
of travel, parking and the like --

00:02:47.398 --> 00:02:48.803
simply cannot meet.

00:02:49.625 --> 00:02:51.266
And we're all acutely aware:

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.085
what's it going to mean in the future

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:55.285
when we ask someone
to pay a hundred dollars

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:57.777
for a symphony, opera or ballet ticket,

00:02:57.801 --> 00:03:01.113
when that cultural consumer
is used to downloading on the internet

00:03:01.137 --> 00:03:05.050
24 hours a day
for 99 cents a song or for free?

00:03:07.402 --> 00:03:11.441
These are enormous questions
for those of us that work in this terrain.

00:03:11.465 --> 00:03:14.576
But as particular as they feel to us,
we know we're not alone.

00:03:15.157 --> 00:03:16.531
All of us are engaged

00:03:16.555 --> 00:03:21.219
in a seismic, fundamental realignment
of culture and communications,

00:03:21.243 --> 00:03:25.007
a realignment that is shaking
and decimating the newspaper industry,

00:03:25.031 --> 00:03:29.061
the magazine industry,
the book and publishing industry and more.

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.572
Saddled in the performing arts as we are,
by antiquated union agreements

00:03:33.596 --> 00:03:38.584
that inhibit and often prohibit
mechanical reproduction and streaming,

00:03:38.608 --> 00:03:42.452
locked into large facilities
that were designed to ossify

00:03:42.476 --> 00:03:45.823
the ideal relationship
between artist and audience

00:03:45.847 --> 00:03:48.132
most appropriate to the 19th century

00:03:48.156 --> 00:03:51.333
and locked into a business model
dependent on high ticket revenues,

00:03:51.357 --> 00:03:53.430
where we charge exorbitant prices.

00:03:53.837 --> 00:03:57.242
Many of us shudder in the wake
of the collapse of Tower Records

00:03:57.266 --> 00:03:59.581
and ask ourselves, "Are we next?"

00:04:01.134 --> 00:04:05.976
Everyone I talk to in performing arts
resonates to the words of Adrienne Rich,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.174
who, in "Dreams of a Common
Language," wrote,

00:04:08.198 --> 00:04:11.345
"We are out in a country
that has no language, no laws.

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.448
Whatever we do together is pure invention.

00:04:14.472 --> 00:04:18.385
The maps they gave us
are out of date by years."

00:04:20.204 --> 00:04:22.109
And for those of you who love the arts,

00:04:22.133 --> 00:04:24.976
aren't you glad you invited
me here to brighten your day?

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.976
(Laughter)

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.442
(Applause)

00:04:28.466 --> 00:04:31.976
Now, rather than saying that we're
on the brink of our own annihilation,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.646
I prefer to believe that we are engaged
in a fundamental reformation,

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.395
a reformation like the religious
Reformation of the 16th century.

00:04:39.906 --> 00:04:42.976
The arts reformation,
like the religious Reformation,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.650
is spurred in part by technology,

00:04:44.674 --> 00:04:47.411
with indeed, the printing press
really leading the charge

00:04:47.435 --> 00:04:49.262
on the religious Reformation.

00:04:49.286 --> 00:04:52.337
Both reformations were predicated
on fractious discussion,

00:04:52.361 --> 00:04:53.770
internal self-doubt

00:04:53.794 --> 00:04:57.207
and massive realignment
of antiquated business models.

00:04:57.846 --> 00:05:01.232
And at heart, both reformations, I think,
were asking the questions:

00:05:01.256 --> 00:05:02.976
who's entitled to practice?

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.706
How are they entitled to practice?

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.718
And indeed, do we need anyone
to intermediate for us

00:05:08.742 --> 00:05:11.824
in order to have an experience
with a spiritual divine?

00:05:13.835 --> 00:05:16.537
Chris Anderson,
someone I trust you all know,

00:05:16.561 --> 00:05:19.573
editor in chief of Wired magazine
and author of The Long Tail,

00:05:19.597 --> 00:05:22.701
really was the first, for me,
to nail a lot of this.

00:05:22.725 --> 00:05:24.396
He wrote a long time ago, you know,

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:29.945
thanks to the invention of the Internet,
web technology, minicams and more,

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:33.424
the means of artistic production
have been democratized

00:05:33.448 --> 00:05:36.172
for the first time
in all of human history.

00:05:37.223 --> 00:05:39.676
In the 1930s, if any of you wanted
to make a movie,

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.976
you had to work for
Warner Brothers or RKO,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.976
because who could afford a movie set

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.096
and lighting equipment
and editing equipment

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.903
and scoring, and more?

00:05:47.927 --> 00:05:51.106
And now who in this room
doesn't know a 14 year-old

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.661
hard at work on her second,
third, or fourth movie?

00:05:53.685 --> 00:05:55.480
(Laughter)

00:05:55.504 --> 00:05:58.588
Similarly, the means
of artistic distribution

00:05:58.612 --> 00:06:01.393
have been democratized
for the first time in human history.

00:06:01.417 --> 00:06:04.368
Again, in the '30s, Warner Brothers,
RKO did that for you.

00:06:04.392 --> 00:06:06.432
Now, go to YouTube, Facebook;

00:06:06.456 --> 00:06:08.380
you have worldwide distribution

00:06:08.404 --> 00:06:11.000
without leaving the privacy
of your own bedroom.

00:06:11.954 --> 00:06:14.330
This double impact is occasioning

00:06:14.354 --> 00:06:17.342
a massive redefinition
of the cultural market,

00:06:17.366 --> 00:06:20.114
a time when anyone is a potential author.

00:06:21.282 --> 00:06:23.629
Frankly, what we're seeing now
in this environment

00:06:23.653 --> 00:06:26.753
is a massive time,
when the entire world is changing

00:06:26.777 --> 00:06:29.915
as we move from a time
when audience numbers are plummeting.

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:32.353
But the number of arts participants,

00:06:32.377 --> 00:06:36.190
people who write poetry, who sing songs,
who perform in church choirs,

00:06:36.214 --> 00:06:39.383
is exploding beyond
our wildest imaginations.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.813
This group, others have
called the pro-ams,

00:06:42.837 --> 00:06:45.734
amateur artists doing work
at a professional level.

00:06:45.758 --> 00:06:47.951
You see them on YouTube,
in dance competitions,

00:06:47.975 --> 00:06:49.658
film festivals and more.

00:06:49.682 --> 00:06:51.597
They are radically expanding

00:06:51.621 --> 00:06:54.800
our notions of the potential
of an aesthetic vocabulary,

00:06:54.824 --> 00:06:56.976
while they are challenging and undermining

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.976
the cultural autonomy
of our traditional institutions.

00:07:00.437 --> 00:07:04.277
Ultimately, we now live in a world
defined not by consumption,

00:07:04.301 --> 00:07:05.571
but by participation.

00:07:07.297 --> 00:07:09.064
But I want to be clear,

00:07:09.088 --> 00:07:11.868
just as the religious Reformation
did not spell the end

00:07:11.892 --> 00:07:13.905
to the formal Church or to the priesthood;

00:07:13.929 --> 00:07:18.113
I believe that our artistic institutions
will continue to have importance.

00:07:18.137 --> 00:07:20.315
They currently are the best opportunities

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:22.615
for artists to have lives
of economic dignity --

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:24.824
not opulence, of dignity.

00:07:24.848 --> 00:07:26.630
And they are the places where artists

00:07:26.654 --> 00:07:29.474
who deserve and want to work
at a certain scale of resources

00:07:29.498 --> 00:07:30.707
will find a home.

00:07:31.583 --> 00:07:35.712
But to view them as synonymous
with the entirety of the arts community

00:07:35.736 --> 00:07:37.567
is, by far, too shortsighted.

00:07:38.462 --> 00:07:42.172
And indeed, while we've tended to polarize
the amateur from the professional,

00:07:42.196 --> 00:07:46.426
the single most exciting development
in the last five to 10 years

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:50.253
has been the rise
of the professional hybrid artist,

00:07:50.277 --> 00:07:51.907
the professional artist who works,

00:07:51.931 --> 00:07:54.652
not primarily in the concert hall
or on the stage;

00:07:54.676 --> 00:07:57.976
but most frequently around
women's rights, or human rights,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.897
or on global warming issues
or AIDS relief for more --

00:08:00.921 --> 00:08:03.051
not out of economic necessity,

00:08:03.075 --> 00:08:05.629
but out of a deep, organic conviction

00:08:05.653 --> 00:08:08.145
that the work that she or he
is called to do

00:08:08.169 --> 00:08:11.845
cannot be accomplished in the traditional
hermetic arts environment.

00:08:12.734 --> 00:08:15.205
Today's dance world is not defined solely

00:08:15.229 --> 00:08:18.418
by the Royal Winnipeg Ballet
or the National Ballet of Canada,

00:08:18.442 --> 00:08:20.888
but by Liz Lerman's Dance Exchange --

00:08:20.912 --> 00:08:23.976
a multi-generational,
professional dance company,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.608
whose dancers range in age from 18 to 82,

00:08:27.632 --> 00:08:31.218
and who work with genomic scientists
to embody the DNA strand

00:08:31.242 --> 00:08:33.427
and with nuclear physicists at CERN.

00:08:34.178 --> 00:08:36.310
Today's professional theater community

00:08:36.334 --> 00:08:39.599
is defined, not only the Shaw
and Stratford Festivals,

00:08:39.623 --> 00:08:42.167
but by the Cornerstone Theater
of Los Angeles --

00:08:42.191 --> 00:08:44.976
a collective of artists that after 9/11,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.487
brought together 10 different
religious communities --

00:08:48.511 --> 00:08:50.299
the Baha'i, the Catholic,

00:08:50.323 --> 00:08:51.976
the Muslim, the Jewish,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.728
even the Native American

00:08:53.752 --> 00:08:55.925
and the gay and lesbian
communities of faith,

00:08:55.949 --> 00:08:58.976
helping them create
their own individual plays

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.976
and one massive play,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.630
where they explored
the differences in their faith

00:09:03.654 --> 00:09:04.976
and found commonality

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.437
as an important first step
toward cross-community healing.

00:09:09.838 --> 00:09:13.350
Today's performers, like Rhodessa Jones,
work in women's prisons,

00:09:13.374 --> 00:09:16.886
helping women prisoners
articulate the pain of incarceration,

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:19.808
while today's playwrights
and directors work with youth gangs

00:09:19.832 --> 00:09:23.831
to find alternate channels to violence
and more and more and more.

00:09:25.358 --> 00:09:27.976
And indeed, I think,
rather than being annihilated,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.478
the performing arts
are poised on the brink of a time

00:09:30.502 --> 00:09:33.113
when we will be more important
than we have ever been.

00:09:34.441 --> 00:09:36.204
You know, we've said for a long time,

00:09:36.228 --> 00:09:39.568
we are critical to the health
of the economic communities in your town.

00:09:39.592 --> 00:09:40.751
And absolutely --

00:09:40.775 --> 00:09:44.738
I hope you know that every dollar spent
on a performing arts ticket in a community

00:09:44.762 --> 00:09:47.860
generates five to seven
additional dollars for the local economy,

00:09:47.884 --> 00:09:49.902
dollars spent in restaurants
or on parking,

00:09:49.926 --> 00:09:52.474
at the fabric stores
where we buy fabric for costumes,

00:09:52.498 --> 00:09:54.976
the piano tuner who tunes
the instruments, and more.

00:09:55.785 --> 00:09:59.617
But the arts are going to be more
important to economies as we go forward,

00:09:59.641 --> 00:10:02.142
especially in industries
we can't even imagine yet,

00:10:02.166 --> 00:10:06.102
just as they have been central to the iPod
and the computer game industries,

00:10:06.126 --> 00:10:09.959
which few, if any of us,
could have foreseen 10 to 15 years ago.

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:15.152
Business leadership will depend
more and more on emotional intelligence,

00:10:15.176 --> 00:10:17.141
the ability to listen deeply,

00:10:17.165 --> 00:10:18.648
to have empathy,

00:10:18.672 --> 00:10:21.384
to articulate change,
to motivate others --

00:10:21.408 --> 00:10:25.228
the very capacities that the arts
cultivate with every encounter.

00:10:26.148 --> 00:10:28.499
Especially now,

00:10:28.523 --> 00:10:33.053
as we all must confront
the fallacy of a market-only orientation,

00:10:33.077 --> 00:10:35.424
uninformed by social conscience;

00:10:35.448 --> 00:10:38.253
we must seize and celebrate
the power of the arts

00:10:38.277 --> 00:10:40.837
to shape our individual
and national characters,

00:10:40.861 --> 00:10:43.928
and especially characters
of the young people,

00:10:43.952 --> 00:10:46.976
who all too often are subjected
to bombardment of sensation,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
rather than digested experience.

00:10:50.246 --> 00:10:53.238
Ultimately, especially now in this world,

00:10:53.262 --> 00:10:57.883
where we live in a context of regressive
and onerous immigration laws,

00:10:57.907 --> 00:11:01.246
in reality TV that thrives on humiliation,

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:02.976
and in a context of analysis,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.678
where the thing we hear most repeatedly,
day in, day out in the United States,

00:11:07.702 --> 00:11:10.807
in every train station, every bus station,
every plane station is,

00:11:10.831 --> 00:11:12.094
"Ladies and gentlemen,

00:11:12.118 --> 00:11:16.148
please report any suspicious behavior
or suspicious individuals

00:11:16.172 --> 00:11:18.134
to the authorities nearest to you,"

00:11:18.158 --> 00:11:20.096
when all of these ways we are encouraged

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:23.168
to view our fellow human being
with hostility and fear

00:11:23.192 --> 00:11:24.920
and contempt and suspicion.

00:11:25.916 --> 00:11:28.759
The arts, whatever they do,
whenever they call us together,

00:11:28.783 --> 00:11:33.425
invite us to look at our fellow
human being with generosity and curiosity.

00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:39.421
God knows, if we ever needed
that capacity in human history,

00:11:39.445 --> 00:11:41.463
we need it now.

00:11:45.114 --> 00:11:46.976
You know, we're bound together,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.427
not, I think by technology,
entertainment and design,

00:11:50.451 --> 00:11:51.690
but by common cause.

00:11:52.521 --> 00:11:55.804
We work to promote
healthy vibrant societies,

00:11:55.828 --> 00:11:58.269
to ameliorate human suffering,

00:11:58.293 --> 00:12:02.897
to promote a more thoughtful,
substantive, empathic world order.

00:12:04.871 --> 00:12:07.451
I salute all of you
as activists in that quest

00:12:07.475 --> 00:12:10.643
and urge you to embrace
and hold dear the arts in your work,

00:12:10.667 --> 00:12:12.417
whatever your purpose may be.

00:12:13.346 --> 00:12:16.265
I promise you the hand
of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation

00:12:16.289 --> 00:12:18.988
is stretched out in friendship
for now and years to come.

00:12:19.012 --> 00:12:21.398
And I thank you for your kindness
and your patience

00:12:21.422 --> 00:12:23.080
in listening to me this afternoon.

00:12:23.104 --> 00:12:24.344
Thank you, and Godspeed.
