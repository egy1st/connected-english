00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
If you really want to understand

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
the problem that we're facing with the oceans,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
you have to think about the biology

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
at the same time you think about the physics.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We can't solve the problems

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
unless we start studying the ocean

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
in a very much more interdisciplinary way.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So I'm going to demonstrate that through

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
discussion of some of the climate change things that are going on in the ocean.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We'll look at sea level rise.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
We'll look at ocean warming.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And then the last thing on the list there, ocean acidification --

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
if you were to ask me, you know, "What do you worry about the most?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
What frightens you?"

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
for me, it's ocean acidification.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And this has come onto the stage pretty recently.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So I will spend a little time at the end.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I was in Copenhagen in December

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
like a number of you in this room.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And I think we all found it, simultaneously,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
an eye-opening

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and a very frustrating experience.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I sat in this large negotiation hall,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
at one point, for three or four hours,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
without hearing the word "oceans" one time.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
It really wasn't on the radar screen.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
The nations that brought it up

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
when we had the speeches of the national leaders --

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
it tended to be the leaders of the small island states,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
the low-lying island states.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And by this weird quirk

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
of alphabetical order of the nations,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
a lot of the low-lying states,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
like Kiribati and Nauru,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
they were seated at the very end of these immensely long rows.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
You know, they were marginalized

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
in the negotiation room.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
One of the problems

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
is coming up with the right target.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
It's not clear what the target should be.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And how can you figure out how to fix something

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
if you don't have a clear target?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Now, you've heard about "two degrees":

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
that we should limit temperature rise to no more than two degrees.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
But there's not a lot of science behind that number.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
We've also talked about

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Should it be 450? Should it be 400?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
There's not a lot of science behind that one either.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Most of the science that is behind these numbers,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
these potential targets,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
is based on studies on land.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And I would say, for the people that work in the ocean

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and think about what the targets should be,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
we would argue that they must be much lower.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
You know, from an oceanic perspective,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
450 is way too high.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Now there's compelling evidence

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
that it really needs to be 350.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
We are, right now, at 390 parts per million

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
of CO2 in the atmosphere.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
We're not going to put the brakes on in time to stop at 450,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
so we've got to accept we're going to do an overshoot,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and the discussion as we go forward

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
has to focus on how far the overshoot goes

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
and what's the pathway back to 350.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Now, why is this so complicated?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Why don't we know some of these things a little bit better?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Well, the problem is that

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
we've got very complicated forces in the climate system.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
There's all kinds of natural causes of climate change.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
There's air-sea interactions.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Here in Galapagos,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
we're affected by El Ninos and La Nina.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
But the entire planet warms up when there's a big El Nino.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Volcanoes eject aerosols into the atmosphere.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
That changes our climate.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
The ocean contains most of the exchangeable heat on the planet.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
So anything that influences

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
how ocean surface waters mix with the deep water

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
changes the ocean of the planet.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And we know the solar output's not constant through time.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
So those are all natural causes of climate change.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And then we have the human-induced causes

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
of climate change as well.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
We're changing the characteristics of the surface of the land,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
the reflectivity.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
We inject our own aerosols into the atmosphere,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and we have trace gases, and not just carbon dioxide --

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
it's methane, ozone,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
oxides of sulfur and nitrogen.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
So here's the thing. It sounds like a simple question.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Is CO2 produced by man's activities

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
causing the planet to warm up?

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
But to answer that question,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
to make a clear attribution to carbon dioxide,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
you have to know something about

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
all of these other agents of change.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
But the fact is we do know a lot about all of those things.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
You know, thousands of scientists

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
have been working on understanding

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
all of these man-made causes

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
and the natural causes.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And we've got it worked out, and we can say,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
"Yes, CO2 is causing the planet to warm up now."

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Now, we have many ways to study natural variability.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
I'll show you a few examples of this now.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
This is the ship that I spent the last three months on in the Antarctic.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
It's a scientific drilling vessel.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
We go out for months at a time and drill into the sea bed

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
to recover sediments

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
that tell us stories of climate change, right.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Like one of the ways to understand our greenhouse future

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
is to drill down in time

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
to the last period

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
where we had CO2 double what it is today.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
And so that's what we've done with this ship.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
This was -- this is south of the Antarctic Circle.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
It looks downright tropical there.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
One day where we had calm seas and sun,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
which was the reason I could get off the ship.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Most of the time it looked like this.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
We had a waves up to 50 ft.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
and winds averaging

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
about 40 knots for most of the voyage

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
and up to 70 or 80 knots.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
So that trip just ended,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
and I can't show you too many results from that right now,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
but we'll go back one more year,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
to another drilling expedition I've been involved in.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
This was led by Ross Powell and Tim Naish.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
It's the ANDRILL project.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And we made the very first bore hole

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
through the largest floating ice shelf on the planet.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
This is a crazy thing, this big drill rig wrapped in a blanket

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
to keep everybody warm,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
drilling at temperatures of minus 40.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
And we drilled in the Ross Sea.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
That's the Ross Sea Ice Shelf on the right there.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
So, this huge floating ice shelf

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
the size of Alaska

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
comes from West Antarctica.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Now, West Antarctica is the part of the continent

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
where the ice is grounded on sea floor

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
as much as 2,000 meters deep.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
So that ice sheet is partly floating,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and it's exposed to the ocean, to the ocean heat.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
This is the part of Antarctica that we worry about.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Because it's partly floating, you can imagine,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
is sea level rises a little bit,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
the ice lifts off the bed, and then it can break off and float north.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
When that ice melts, sea level rises by six meters.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
So we drill back in time to see how often that's happened,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
and exactly how fast that ice can melt.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Here's the cartoon on the left there.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
We drilled through a hundred meters of floating ice shelf

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
then through 900 meters of water

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
and then 1,300 meters into the sea floor.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
So it's the deepest geological bore hole ever drilled.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
It took about 10 years to put this project together.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
And here's what we found.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Now, there's 40 scientists working on this project,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
and people are doing all kinds of really complicated

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
and expensive analyses.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
But it turns out, you know, the thing that told the best story

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
was this simple visual description.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
You know, we saw this in the core samples as they came up.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
We saw these alternations

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
between sediments that look like this --

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
there's gravel and cobbles in there

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
and a bunch of sand.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
That's the kind of material in the deep sea.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
It can only get there if it's carried out by ice.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
So we know there's an ice shelf overhead.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
And that alternates with a sediment that looks like this.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
This is absolutely beautiful stuff.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
This sediment is 100 percent made up

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
of the shells of microscopic plants.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
And these plants need sunlight,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
so we know when we find that sediment

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
there's no ice overhead.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
And we saw about 35 alternations

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
between open water and ice-covered water,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
between gravels and these plant sediments.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
So what that means is, what it tells us

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
is that the Ross Sea region, this ice shelf,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
melted back and formed anew

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
about 35 times.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
And this is in the past four million years.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
This was completely unexpected.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Nobody imagined that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
was this dynamic.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
In fact, the lore for many years has been,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
"The ice formed many tens of millions of years ago,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
and it's been there ever since."

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
And now we know that in our recent past

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
it melted back and formed again,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
and sea level went up and down, six meters at a time.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
What caused it?

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Well, we're pretty sure that it's very small changes

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
in the amount of sunlight reaching Antarctica,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
just caused by natural changes in the orbit of the Earth.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
But here's the key thing:

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
you know, the other thing we found out

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
is that the ice sheet passed a threshold,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
that the planet warmed up enough --

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
and the number's about one degree to one and a half degrees Centigrade --

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
the planet warmed up enough that it became ...

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
that ice sheet became very dynamic

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
and was very easily melted.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
And you know what?

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
We've actually changed the temperature in the last century

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
just the right amount.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
So many of us are convinced now

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
that West Antarctica, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, is starting to melt.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
We do expect to see a sea-level rise

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
on the order of one to two meters by the end of this century.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
And it could be larger than that.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
This is a serious consequence

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
for nations like Kiribati,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
you know, where the average elevation

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
is about a little over a meter above sea level.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Okay, the second story takes place here in Galapagos.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
This is a bleached coral,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
coral that died during the 1982-'83 El Nino.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
This is from Champion Island.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
It's about a meter tall Pavona clavus colony.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
And it's covered with algae. That's what happens.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
When these things die,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
immediately, organisms come in

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
and encrust and live on that dead surface.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
And so, when a coral colony is killed

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
by an El Nino event,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
it leaves this indelible record.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
You can go then and study corals

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
and figure out how often do you see this.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
So one of the things thought of in the '80s

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
was to go back and take cores

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
of coral heads throughout the Galapagos

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
and find out how often was there a devastating event.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And just so you know, 1982-'83,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
that El Nino killed 95 percent

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
of all the corals here in Galapagos.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Then there was similar mortality in '97-'98.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
And what we found

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
after drilling back in time two to 400 years

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
was that these were unique events.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
We saw no other mass mortality events.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
So these events in our recent past really are unique.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
So they're either just truly monster El Ninos,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
or they're just very strong El Ninos

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
that occurred against a backdrop of global warming.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Either case, it's bad news

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
for the corals of the Galapagos Islands.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Here's how we sample the corals.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
This is actually Easter Island. Look at this monster.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
This coral is eight meters tall, right.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
And it been growing for about 600 years.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Now, Sylvia Earle turned me on to this exact same coral.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
And she was diving here with John Lauret -- I think it was 1994 --

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
and collected a little nugget and sent it to me.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
And we started working on it,

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
and we figured out we could tell the temperature of the ancient ocean

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
from analyzing a coral like this.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
So we have a diamond drill.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
We're not killing the colony; we're taking a small core sample out of the top.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
The core comes up as these cylindrical tubes of limestone.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000
And that material then we take back to the lab and analyze it.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
You can see some of the coral cores there on the right.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
So we've done that all over the Eastern Pacific.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
We're starting to do it in the Western Pacific as well.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
I'll take you back here to the Galapagos Islands.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
And we've been working at this fascinating uplift here in Urbina Bay.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
That the place where,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
during an earthquake in 1954,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
this marine terrace was lifted up

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
out of the ocean very quickly,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
and it was lifted up about six to seven meters.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
And so now you can walk through a coral reef without getting wet.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
If you go on the ground there, it looks like this,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
and this is the grandaddy coral.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
It's 11 meters in diameter,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
and we know that it started growing

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
in the year 1584.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Imagine that.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
And that coral was growing happily in those shallow waters,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
until 1954, when the earthquake happened.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Now the reason we know it's 1584

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
is that these corals have growth bands.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
When you cut them, slice those cores in half and x-ray them,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
you see these light and dark bands.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Each one of those is a year.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
We know these corals grow about a centimeter and a half a year.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
And we just count on down to the bottom.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Then their other attribute is

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
that they have this great chemistry.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
We can analyze the carbonate

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
that makes up the coral,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
and there's a whole bunch of things we can do.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
But in this case, we measured the different isotopes of oxygen.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Their ratio tells us the water temperature.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
In this example here,

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
we had monitored this reef in Galapagos

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
with temperature recorders,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
so we know the temperature of the water the coral's growing in.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Then after we harvest a coral, we measure this ratio,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
and now you can see, those curves match perfectly.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
In this case, at these islands,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
you know, corals

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
are instrumental-quality recorders of change in the water.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
And of course, our thermometers

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
only take us back 50 years or so here.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
The coral can take us back

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
hundreds and thousands of years.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
So, what we do:

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
we've merged a lot of different data sets.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
It's not just my group; there's maybe 30 groups worldwide doing this.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
But we get these instrumental- and near-instrumental-quality records

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
of temperature change that go back hundreds of years,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
and we put them together.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Here's a synthetic diagram.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
There's a whole family of curves here.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
But what's happening: we're looking at the last thousand years

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
of temperature on the planet.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
And there's five or six different compilations there,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
But each one of those compilations reflects input

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
from hundreds of these kinds of records from corals.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
We do similar things with ice cores.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
We work with tree rings.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
And that's how we discover

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
what is truly natural

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
and how different is the last century, right?

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
And I chose this one

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
because it's complicated and messy looking, right.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
This is as messy as it gets.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
You can see there's some signals there.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Some of the records

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
show lower temperatures than others.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Some of them show greater variability.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
But they all tell us

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
what the natural variability is.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Some of them are from the northern hemisphere;

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
some are from the entire globe.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
But here's what we can say:

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000
what's natural in the last thousand years is that the planet was cooling down.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
It was cooling down

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
until about 1900 or so.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
And there is natural variability

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
caused by the Sun, caused by El Ninos.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
A century-scale, decadal-scale variability,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
and we know the magnitude;

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
it's about two-tenths to four-tenths of a degree Centigrade.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
But then at the very end is where

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
we have the instrumental record in black.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
And there's the temperature up there in 2009.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
You know, we've warmed the globe

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
about a degree Centigrade in the last century,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
and there's nothing

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
in the natural part of that record

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
that resembles what we've seen in the last century.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
You know, that's the strength of our argument,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
that we are doing something that's truly different.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
So I'll close with a short discussion

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
of ocean acidification.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
I like it as a component of global change to talk about,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000
because, even if you are a hard-bitten global warming skeptic,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
and I talk to that community fairly often,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
you cannot deny

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
the simple physics

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
of CO2 dissolving in the ocean.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
You know, we're pumping out lots of CO2 into the atmosphere,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
from fossil fuels, from cement production.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Right now, about a third of that carbon dioxide

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
is dissolving straight into the sea, right?

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
And as it does so,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
it makes the ocean more acidic.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
So, you cannot argue with that.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
That is what's happening right now,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
and it's a very different issue

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
than the global warming issue.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
It has many consequences.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
There's consequences for carbonate organisms.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
There are many organisms

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
that build their shells out of calcium carbonate --

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
plants and animals both.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
The main framework material of coral reefs

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
is calcium carbonate.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
That material is more soluble

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
in acidic fluid.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
So one of the things we're seeing

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
is organisms are having

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
to spend more metabolic energy

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
to build and maintain their shells.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
At some point, as this transience,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
as this CO2 uptake in the ocean continues,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
that material's actually going to start to dissolve.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
And on coral reefs,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
where some of the main framework organisms disappear,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
we will see a major loss

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
of marine biodiversity.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
But it's not just the carbonate producers that are affected.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000
There's many physiological processes

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
that are influenced by the acidity of the ocean.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
So many reactions involving enzymes and proteins

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
are sensitive to the acid content of the ocean.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
So, all of these things --

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
greater metabolic demands,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
reduced reproductive success,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000
changes in respiration and metabolism.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
You know, these are things that we have good physiological reasons

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
to expect to see stressed

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
caused by this transience.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
So we figured out some pretty interesting ways

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
to track CO2 levels in the atmosphere,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
going back millions of years.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
We used to do it just with ice cores,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
but in this case, we're going back 20 million years.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
And we take samples of the sediment,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
and it tells us the CO2 level of the ocean,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
and therefore the CO2 level of the atmosphere.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
And here's the thing:

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
you have to go back about 15 million years

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
to find a time when CO2 levels

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
were about what they are today.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
You have to go back about 30 million years

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
to find a time when CO2 levels

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
were double what they are today.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Now, what that means is

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
that all of the organisms that live in the sea

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
have evolved in this chemostatted ocean,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
with CO2 levels lower than they are today.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
That's the reason that they're not able to respond or adapt

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
to this rapid acidification

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
that's going on right now.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
So, Charlie Veron

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
came up with this statement last year:

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
"The prospect of ocean acidification

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
may well be the most serious

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
of all of the predicted outcomes

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
of anthropogenic CO2 release."

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
And I think that may very well be true,

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
so I'll close with this.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
You know, we do need the protected areas, absolutely,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
but for the sake of the oceans,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
we have to cap or limit CO2 emissions

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
as soon as possible.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
Thank you very much.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
(Applause)
