WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
If nothing else, at least I've discovered

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
what it is we put our speakers through:

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
sweaty palms, sleepless nights,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
a wholly unnatural fear of clocks.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I mean, it's quite brutal.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And I'm also a little nervous about this.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
There are nine billion humans coming our way.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Now, the most optimistic dreams

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
can get dented by the prospect

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
of people plundering the planet.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
But recently, I've become intrigued

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
by a different way of thinking of large human crowds,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
because there are circumstances

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
where they can do something really cool.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
It's a phenomenon that I think

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
any organization or individual can tap into.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
It certainly impacted the way we think about TED's future,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and perhaps the world's future overall.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
So, let's explore.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
The story starts with just a single person,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
a child, behaving a little strangely.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
This kid is known online as Lil Demon.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
He's doing tricks here, dance tricks,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
that probably no six-year-old in history ever managed before.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
How did he learn them?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And what drove him to spend the hundreds of hours of practice

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
this must have taken?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Here's a clue.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
(Video) Lil Demon: ♫ Step your game up. Oh. Oh. ♫

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
♫ Step your game up. Oh. Oh. ♫

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Chris Anderson: So, that was sent to me by this man,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
a filmmaker, Jonathan Chu,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
who told me that was the moment he realized

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
the Internet was causing dance to evolve.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
This is what he said at TED in February.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
In essence,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
dancers were challenging each other online to get better;

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
incredible new dance skills were being invented;

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
even the six-year-olds were joining in.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
It felt like a revolution.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And so Jon had a brilliant idea:

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
He went out to recruit the best of the best dancers

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
off of YouTube

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
to create this dance troupe --

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
The League of Extraordinary Dancers, the LXD.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I mean, these kids were web-taught,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
but they were so good that they got to play at the Oscars this year.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
And at TED here in February,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
their passion and brilliance just took our breath away.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
So, this story

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
of the evolution of dance

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
seems strangely familiar.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
You know, a while after TEDTalks started taking off,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
we noticed that speakers

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
were starting to spend a lot more time in preparation.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
It was resulting in incredible new talks like these two.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
... Months of preparation

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
crammed into 18 minutes,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
raising the bar cruelly for the next generation of speakers,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
with the effects that we've seen this week.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
It's not as if J.J. and Jill

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
actually ended their talks saying, "Step your game up,"

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
but they might as well have.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
So, in both of these cases,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
you've got these cycles of improvement,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
apparently driven

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
by people watching web video.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
What is going on here?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Well, I think it's the latest iteration of a phenomenon we can call

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
"crowd-accelerated innovation."

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And there are just three things you need for this thing to kick into gear.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
You can think of them

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
as three dials on a giant wheel.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
You turn up the dials, the wheel starts to turn.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
And the first thing you need is ... a crowd,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
a group of people who share a common interest.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
The bigger the crowd,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
the more potential innovators there are.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
That's important, but actually most people in the crowd

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
occupy these other roles.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
They're creating the ecosystem

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
from which innovation emerges.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
The second thing you need is light.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
You need clear, open visibility

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
of what the best people in that crowd are capable of,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
because that is how you will learn

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
how you will be empowered to participate.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And third, you need desire.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
You know, innovation's hard work.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
It's based on hundreds of hours of research, of practice.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Absent desire, not going to happen.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Now, here's an example -- pre-Internet --

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
of this machine in action.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Dancers at a street corner --

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
it's a crowd, a small one,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
but they can all obviously see what each other can do.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And the desire part comes, I guess,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
from social status, right?

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Best dancer walks tall, gets the best date.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
There's probably going to be some innovation happening here.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
But on the web,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
all three dials are ratcheted right up.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
The dance community is now global.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
There's millions connected.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
And amazingly,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
you can still see what the best can do,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
because the crowd itself shines a light on them,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
either directly, through comments, ratings,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
email, Facebook, Twitter,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
or indirectly,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
through numbers of views,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
through links that point Google there.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
So, it's easy to find the good stuff,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
and when you've found it, you can watch it in close-up repeatedly

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
and read what hundreds of people have written about it.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
That's a lot of light.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
But the desire element

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
is really dialed way up.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
I mean, you might just be a kid with a webcam,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
but if you can do something that goes viral,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
you get to be seen by the equivalent

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
of sports stadiums crammed with people.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
You get hundreds of strangers writing excitedly about you.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
And even if it's not that eloquent -- and it's not --

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
it can still really make your day.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
So, this possibility

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
of a new type of global recognition,

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
I think, is driving huge amounts of effort.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
And it's important to note that it's not just the stars who are benefiting:

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
because you can see the best, everyone can learn.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Also, the system is self-fueling.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
It's the crowd that shines the light and fuels the desire,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
but the light and desire are a lethal one-two combination

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
that attract new people to the crowd.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
So, this is a model

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
that pretty much any organization could use

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
to try and nurture its own cycle

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
of crowd-accelerated innovation.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Invite the crowd, let in the light,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
dial up the desire.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
And the hardest part about that is probably the light,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
because it means you have to open up,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
you have to show your stuff to the world.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
It's by giving away what you think is your deepest secret

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
that maybe millions of people

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
are empowered to help improve it.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
And, very happily, there's one class of people

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
who really can't make use of this tool.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
The dark side of the web

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
is allergic to the light.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
I don't think we're going to see terrorists, for example,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
publishing their plans online and saying to the world,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
"Please, could you help us to actually

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
make them work this time?"

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
But you can publish your stuff online.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And if you can get that wheel to turn,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
look out.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
So, at TED,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
we've become a little obsessed with this idea of openness.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
In fact, my colleague, June Cohen, has taken to calling it "radical openness,"

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
because it works for us each time.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
We opened up our talks to the world,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
and suddenly there are millions of people out there

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
helping spread our speakers' ideas,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
and thereby making it easier for us

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
to recruit and motivate the next generation of speakers.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
By opening up our translation program,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
thousands of heroic volunteers --

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
some of them watching online right now, and thank you! --

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
have translated our talks

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
into more than 70 languages,

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
thereby tripling our viewership in non-English-speaking countries.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
By giving away our TEDx brand,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
we suddenly have a thousand-plus

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
live experiments in the art of spreading ideas.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
And these organizers,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
they're seeing each other, they're learning from each other.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
We are learning from them.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
We're getting great talks back from them.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
The wheel is turning.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Okay, step back a minute.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
I mean, it's really not news for me to tell you

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
that innovation emerges out of groups.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
You know, we've heard that this week --

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
this romantic notion of the lone genius

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
with the "eureka!" moment that changes the world

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
is misleading.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Even he said that, and he would know.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
We're a social species.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
We spark off each other.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
It's also not news

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
to say that the Internet has accelerated innovation.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
For the past 15 years,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
powerful communities have been connecting online,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
sparking off each other.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
If you take programmers,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
you know, the whole open-source movement

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
is a fantastic instance of crowd-accelerated innovation.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
But what's key here is,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
the reason these groups have been able to connect

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
is because their work output is of the type

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000
that can be easily shared digitally --

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
a picture, a music file,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
software.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
And that's why what I'm excited about,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
and what I think is under-reported,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
is the significance of the rise

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
of online video.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
This is the technology

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
that's going to allow the rest of the world's talents to be shared digitally,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
thereby launching a whole new cycle

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
of crowd-accelerated innovation.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
The first few years of the web

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
were pretty much video-free,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
for this reason: video files are huge; the web couldn't handle them.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
But in the last 10 years,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
bandwidth has exploded a hundredfold.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Suddenly, here we are.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Humanity watches 80 million hours of YouTube every day.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Cisco actually estimates that, within four years,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
more than 90 percent of the web's data will be video.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
If it's all puppies, porn and piracy,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
we're doomed.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
I don't think it will be.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Video is high-bandwidth for a reason.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
It packs a huge amount of data,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
and our brains are uniquely wired to decode it.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Here, let me introduce you to Sam Haber.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
He's a unicyclist.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Before YouTube,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
there was no way for him to discover

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
his sport's true potential,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
because you can't communicate this stuff in words, right?

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
But looking at video clips posted by strangers,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
a world of possibility opens up for him.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Suddenly, he starts to emulate and then to innovate.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
And a global community of unicyclists discover each other online,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
inspire each other to greatness.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
And there are thousands of other examples of this happening --

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
of video-driven evolution of skills,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
ranging from the physical to the artful.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
And I have to tell you,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
as a former publisher of hobbyist magazines,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
I find this strangely beautiful.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
I mean, there's a lot of passion right here on this screen.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
But if Rube Goldberg machines

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
and video poetry aren't quite your cup of tea,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
how about this.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Jove is a website

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
that was founded to encourage scientists

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
to publish their peer-reviewed research

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
on video.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
There's a problem with a traditional scientific paper.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
It can take months for a scientist in another lab

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
to figure out how to replicate the experiments

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
that are described in print.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Here's one such frustrated scientist,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Moshe Pritsker, the founder of Jove.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
He told me that the world is wasting

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
billions of dollars on this.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
But look at this video.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
I mean, look: if you can show

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
instead of just describing,

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
that problem goes away.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
So it's not far-fetched to say

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
that, at some point,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
online video is going to dramatically accelerate scientific advance.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Here's another example

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
that's close to our hearts at TED,

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
where video is sometimes more powerful than print --

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
the sharing of an idea.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Why do people like watching TEDTalks?

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
All those ideas are already out there in print.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
It's actually faster to read than to view.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Why would someone bother?

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Well, so, there's some showing as well as telling.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
But even leaving the screen out of it,

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
there's still a lot more being transferred than just words.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
And in that non-verbal portion, there's some serious magic.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Somewhere hidden in the physical gestures,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
the vocal cadence, the facial expressions,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
the eye contact,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
the passion,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
the kind of awkward, British body language,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
the sense of how the audience are reacting,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
there are hundreds of subconscious clues

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
that go to how well you will understand,

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
and whether you're inspired --

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
light, if you like,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
and desire.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Incredibly, all of this can be communicated

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
on just a few square inches of a screen.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Reading and writing are actually

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
relatively recent inventions.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Face-to-face communication has been fine-tuned

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
by millions of years of evolution.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
That's what's made it into this mysterious, powerful thing it is.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Someone speaks,

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
there's resonance in all these receiving brains,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
the whole group acts together.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
I mean, this is the connective tissue

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
of the human superorganism in action.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
It's probably driven our culture for millennia.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
500 years ago, it ran into

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
a competitor with a lethal advantage.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
It's right here.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Print scaled.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
The world's ambitious innovators and influencers

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
now could get their ideas to spread far and wide,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
and so the art of the spoken word

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
pretty much withered on the vine.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
But now, in the blink of an eye,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
the game has changed again.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
It's not too much to say

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
that what Gutenberg did for writing,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
online video can now do for face-to-face communication.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
So, that primal medium,

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
which your brain is exquisitely wired for ...

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
that just went global.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Now, this is big.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
We may have to reinvent an ancient art form.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
I mean, today, one person speaking

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
can be seen by millions,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
shedding bright light on potent ideas,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
creating intense desire

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
for learning and to respond --

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
and in his case, intense desire to laugh.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
For the first time in human history,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
talented students

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
don't have to have their potential and their dreams

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
written out of history by lousy teachers.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
They can sit two feet in front of the world's finest.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Now, TED is just a small part of this.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
I mean, the world's universities are opening up their curricula.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Thousands of individuals and organizations

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
are sharing their knowledge and data online.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Thousands of people are figuring out new ways

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
to learn and, crucially,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
to respond, completing the cycle.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
And so, as we've thought about this,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
you know, it's become clear to us

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
what the next stage of TED's evolution has to be.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
TEDTalks can't be a one-way process, one-to-many.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Our future is many-to-many.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
So, we're dreaming of ways

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
to make it easier for you, the global TED community,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
to respond to speakers,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
to contribute your own ideas,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
maybe even your own TEDTalks,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
and to help shine a light on the very best of what's out there.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Because, if we can bubble up the very best

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
from a vastly larger pool,

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
this wheel turns.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Now, is it possible to imagine

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
a similar process to this,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
happening to global education overall?

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
I mean, does it have to be this painful,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
top-down process?

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Why not a self-fueling cycle

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
in which we all can participate?

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
It's the participation age, right?

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Schools can't be silos.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
We can't stop learning at age 21.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
What if, in the coming crowd of nine billion ...

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
what if that crowd could learn enough

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
to be net contributors,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
instead of net plunderers?

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
That changes everything, right?

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000
I mean, that would take more teachers than we've ever had.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
But the good news is they are out there.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
They're in the crowd,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
and the crowd is switching on lights,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
and we can see them for the first time,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
not as an undifferentiated mass of strangers,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
but as individuals we can learn from.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Who's the teacher?

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
You're the teacher.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
You're part of the crowd

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
that may be about to launch

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
the biggest learning cycle in human history,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
a cycle capable of carrying all of us

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
to a smarter, wiser, more beautiful place.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Here's a group of kids in a village in Pakistan

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
near where I grew up.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
Within five years, each of these kids is going to have access

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
to a cellphone capable of full-on web video

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
and capable of uploading video to the web.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000
I mean, is it crazy to think that this girl,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
in the back, at the right, in 15 years,

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
might be sharing the idea that keeps the world beautiful

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
for your grandchildren?

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
It's not crazy; it's actually happening right now.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
I want to introduce you to a good friend of TED

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
who just happens to live in Africa's biggest shantytown.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.000
(Video) Christopher Makau: Hi. My name is Christopher Makau.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
I'm one of the organizers of TEDxKibera.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
There are so many good things which are happening right here in Kibera.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
There's a self-help group.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
They turned a trash place into a garden.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
The same spot, it was a crime spot

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
where people were being robbed.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
They used the same trash

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
to form green manure.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
The same trash site

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
is feeding more than 30 families.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
We have our own film school.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
They are using Flip cameras

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
to record, edit,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
and reporting to their own channel,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Kibera TV.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Because of a scarcity of land,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
we are using the sacks to grow vegetables,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
and also [we're] able to save on the cost of living.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Change happens when we see things in a different way.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Today, I see Kibera in a different way.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
My message to TEDGlobal

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
and the entire world is:

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
Kibera is a hotbed

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
of innovation and ideas.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:45.000
(Applause)

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
CA: You know what?

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
I bet Chris has always been an inspiring guy.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000
What's new -- and it's huge --

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
is that, for the first time, we get to see him,

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
and he can see us.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Right now, Chris and Kevin

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
and Dennis and Dickson and their friends

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
are watching us, in Nairobi, right now.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Guys,

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
we've learned from you today.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Thank you.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
And thank you.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:31.000
(Applause)
