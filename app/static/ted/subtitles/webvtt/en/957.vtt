00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's start with day and night.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Life evolved under conditions

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
of light and darkness,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
light and then darkness.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And so plants and animals

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
developed their own internal clocks

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
so that they would be ready for these changes in light.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
These are chemical clocks,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and they're found in every known being that has two or more cells

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and in some that only have one cell.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I'll give you an example --

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
if you take a horseshoe crab off the beach,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and you fly it all the way across the continent,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and you drop it into a sloped cage,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
it will scramble up the floor of the cage

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
as the tide is rising

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
on its home shores,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and it'll skitter down again right as the water is receding

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
thousands of miles away.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It'll do this for weeks,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
until it kind of gradually loses the plot.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And it's incredible to watch,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
but there's nothing psychic or paranormal going on;

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
it's simply that these crabs have internal cycles

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
that correspond, usually, with what's going on around it.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
So, we have this ability as well.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
And in humans, we call it the "body clock."

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
You can see this most clearly when you take away someone's watch

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and you shut them into a bunker, deep underground,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
for a couple of months. (Laughter)

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
People actually volunteer for this,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and they usually come out

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
kind of raving about their productive time in the hole.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
So, no matter how atypical these subjects would have to be,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
they all show the same thing.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
They get up just a little bit later every day -- say 15 minutes or so --

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and they kind of drift all the way around the clock like this

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
over the course of the weeks.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And so, in this way we know that they are working on their own internal clocks,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
rather than somehow sensing the day outside.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
So fine, we have a body clock,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and it turns out that it's incredibly important in our lives.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
It's a huge driver for culture

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and I think that it's the most underrated force on our behavior.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
We evolved as a species near the equator,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and so we're very well-equipped

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
to deal with 12 hours of daylight

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and 12 hours of darkness.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
But of course, we've spread to every corner of the globe

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and in Arctic Canada, where I live,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
we have perpetual daylight in summer

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and 24 hours of darkness in winter.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
So the culture, the northern aboriginal culture,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
traditionally has been highly seasonal.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
In winter, there's a lot of sleeping going on;

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
you enjoy your family life inside.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
And in summer, it's almost manic hunting

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and working activity very long hours,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
very active.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
So, what would our natural rhythm look like?

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
What would our sleeping patterns be

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
in the sort of ideal sense?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Well, it turns out

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
that when people are living

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
without any sort of artificial light at all,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
they sleep twice every night.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
They go to bed around 8:00 p.m.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
until midnight

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
and then again, they sleep

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
from about 2:00 a.m. until sunrise.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And in-between, they have a couple of hours

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
of sort of meditative quiet in bed.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
And during this time,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
there's a surge of prolactin,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
the likes of which a modern day never sees.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
The people in these studies

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
report feeling so awake during the daytime,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
that they realize

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
they're experiencing true wakefulness

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
for the first time in their lives.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
So, cut to the modern day.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
We're living in a culture of jet lag,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
global travel,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
24-hour business,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
shift work.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And you know, our modern ways

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
of doing things

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
have their advantages,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
but I believe we should understand the costs.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Thank you.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
(Applause)
