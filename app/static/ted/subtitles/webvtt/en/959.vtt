00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now, since this is TEDGlobal,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
who can tell me what this is called in French?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I see you're all up on the history of hurdy-gurdy --

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
"vielle Ã  roue."

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
And in Spanish, "zanfona."

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And in Italian, "ghironda," okay?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Hurdy-gurdy, or wheel fiddle.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
So, these are the different kinds and shapes of the hurdy-gurdy.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The hurdy-gurdy is the only musical instrument

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
that uses a crank to turn a wheel

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
to rub strings, like the bow of a violin,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
to produce music.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It has three different kinds of strings.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The first string is the drone string,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
which plays a continuous sound like the bagpipe.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The second string is a melody string,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
which is played with a wooden keyboard tuned like a piano.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And the third string is pretty innovative.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
It's also the only instrument

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
that uses this kind of technique.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
It activates what's called the buzzing bridge, or the dog.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
When I turn the crank and I apply pressure,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
it makes a sound like a barking dog.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
So all of this is pretty innovative,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
if you consider

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
that the hurdy-gurdy appeared about a thousand years ago

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and it took two people to play it;

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
one to turn the crank,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and another person -- yes -- to play the melody

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
by physically pulling up large wooden pegs.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Luckily, all of this changed a couple of centuries later.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
So, one person could actually play

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and almost -- this is pretty heavy --

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
carry the hurdy-gurdy.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
The hurdy-gurdy has been used, historically, through the centuries

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
in mostly dance music

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
because of the uniqueness of the melody

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
combined with the acoustic boombox here.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And today, the hurdy-gurdy is used in all sorts of music --

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
traditional folk music,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
dance, contemporary

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and world music --

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
in the U.K., in France, in Spain

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and in Italy.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And this kind of hurdy-gurdy takes anywhere from three to five years [to order and receive it].

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
It's made by specialized luthiers,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
also in Europe.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And it's very difficult to tune.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
So without further ado, would you like to hear it?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
(Audience: Yes.)

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Caroline Phillips: I didn't hear you. Would you like to hear it? (Audience: Yes!)

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
CP: Okay.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
There I go.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I'd like to sing in Basque,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
which is the language spoken in the Basque Country where I live,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
in the region in France and Spain.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
(Music)

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
[Basque]

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
(Music)

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Thank you.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
(Applause)

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
This is a song that I wrote

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
based on traditional Basque rhythms.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
And this is a song that has a kind of a Celtic feel.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:45.000
(Music)

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Thank you. Thank you.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
(Applause)
