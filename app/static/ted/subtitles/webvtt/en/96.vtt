WEBVTT

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.478
Thank you. I have to tell you
I'm both challenged and excited.

00:00:05.502 --> 00:00:08.414
My excitement is: I get a chance
to give something back.

00:00:08.438 --> 00:00:11.976
My challenge is: the shortest seminar
I usually do is 50 hours.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.625
(Laughter)

00:00:13.649 --> 00:00:15.879
I'm not exaggerating. I do weekends --

00:00:15.903 --> 00:00:18.138
I do more, obviously,
I also coach people --

00:00:18.162 --> 00:00:20.933
but I'm into immersion,
because how did you learn language?

00:00:20.957 --> 00:00:22.562
Not just by learning principles,

00:00:22.586 --> 00:00:25.439
you got in it and you did it
so often that it became real.

00:00:25.463 --> 00:00:28.940
The bottom line of why I'm here,
besides being a crazy mofo, is that --

00:00:28.964 --> 00:00:32.703
I'm not here to motivate you,
you don't need that, obviously.

00:00:32.727 --> 00:00:34.750
Often that's what people think I do,

00:00:34.774 --> 00:00:36.489
and it's the furthest thing from it.

00:00:36.513 --> 00:00:38.558
What happens, though, is people say to me,

00:00:38.582 --> 00:00:40.050
"I don't need any motivation."

00:00:40.075 --> 00:00:41.617
But that's not what I do.

00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:43.508
I'm the "why" guy.

00:00:43.532 --> 00:00:45.604
I want to know why you do what you do.

00:00:45.628 --> 00:00:47.453
What is your motive for action?

00:00:48.135 --> 00:00:51.313
What is it that drives you
in your life today? Not 10 years ago.

00:00:51.337 --> 00:00:53.042
Are you running the same pattern?

00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:56.978
Because I believe that the invisible force
of internal drive, activated,

00:00:57.002 --> 00:00:58.810
is the most important thing.

00:00:58.834 --> 00:01:02.413
I'm here because I believe
emotion is the force of life.

00:01:02.437 --> 00:01:04.254
All of us here have great minds.

00:01:04.278 --> 00:01:06.706
Most of us here have great minds, right?

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.090
We all know how to think.

00:01:09.114 --> 00:01:11.203
With our minds we can
rationalize anything.

00:01:11.227 --> 00:01:12.569
We can make anything happen.

00:01:12.593 --> 00:01:15.371
I agree with what was described
a few days ago,

00:01:15.395 --> 00:01:17.722
that people work in their self-interest.

00:01:17.746 --> 00:01:20.364
But we know that that's bullshit at times.

00:01:20.388 --> 00:01:22.752
You don't work in your
self-interest all the time,

00:01:22.776 --> 00:01:24.643
because when emotion comes into it,

00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:26.710
the wiring changes
in the way it functions.

00:01:26.734 --> 00:01:30.685
So it's wonderful to think intellectually
about how the life of the world is,

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:33.868
especially those who are very smart
can play this game in our head.

00:01:33.892 --> 00:01:35.994
But I really want to know
what's driving you.

00:01:36.018 --> 00:01:37.876
What I would like to invite you to do

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.406
by the end of this talk is explore
where you are today, for two reasons.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.311
One: so that you can contribute more.

00:01:43.335 --> 00:01:46.605
And two: that hopefully we can not just
understand other people more,

00:01:46.629 --> 00:01:49.519
but appreciate them more,
and create the kinds of connections

00:01:49.543 --> 00:01:52.466
that can stop some of the challenges
that we face today.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.235
They're only going to get magnified
by the very technology that connects us,

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.045
because it's making us intersect.

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:00.295
That intersection
doesn't always create a view

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:02.505
of "everybody now understands everybody,

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:04.893
and everybody appreciates everybody."

00:02:04.917 --> 00:02:07.508
I've had an obsession
basically for 30 years,

00:02:07.532 --> 00:02:11.847
"What makes the difference
in the quality of people's lives?

00:02:11.871 --> 00:02:13.328
What in their performance?"

00:02:13.352 --> 00:02:15.530
I got hired to produce the result now.

00:02:15.554 --> 00:02:17.050
I've done it for 30 years.

00:02:17.074 --> 00:02:18.621
I get the phone call

00:02:18.645 --> 00:02:21.387
when the athlete is burning down
on national television,

00:02:21.411 --> 00:02:23.097
and they were ahead by five strokes

00:02:23.121 --> 00:02:25.121
and now they can't get back on the course.

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:27.831
I've got to do something right now
or nothing matters.

00:02:27.855 --> 00:02:30.827
I get the phone call when the child
is going to commit suicide,

00:02:30.851 --> 00:02:32.298
I've got to do something.

00:02:32.322 --> 00:02:35.976
In 29 years, I'm very grateful
to tell you I've never lost one.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.504
It doesn't mean I won't some day,
but I haven't yet.

00:02:38.528 --> 00:02:41.904
The reason is an understanding
of these human needs.

00:02:41.928 --> 00:02:45.039
When I get those calls
about performance, that's one thing.

00:02:45.063 --> 00:02:46.549
How do you make a change?

00:02:46.573 --> 00:02:50.568
I'm also looking to see what is shaping
the person's ability to contribute,

00:02:50.592 --> 00:02:54.102
to do something beyond themselves.

00:02:54.126 --> 00:02:56.234
Maybe the real question is,

00:02:56.258 --> 00:02:58.629
I look at life and say
there's two master lessons.

00:02:58.653 --> 00:03:00.732
One is: there's the science
of achievement,

00:03:00.756 --> 00:03:03.526
which almost everyone here
has mastered amazingly.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.045
"How do you take the invisible
and make it visible,"

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:07.786
How do you make your dreams happen?

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.397
Your business, your contribution
to society, money --

00:03:10.421 --> 00:03:12.133
whatever, your body, your family.

00:03:12.157 --> 00:03:15.660
The other lesson that is rarely
mastered is the art of fulfillment.

00:03:16.517 --> 00:03:18.093
Because science is easy, right?

00:03:18.117 --> 00:03:21.022
We know the rules, you write the code
and you get the results.

00:03:21.046 --> 00:03:24.190
Once you know the game,
you just up the ante, don't you?

00:03:24.214 --> 00:03:26.647
But when it comes
to fulfillment -- that's an art.

00:03:26.671 --> 00:03:29.867
The reason is, it's about
appreciation and contribution.

00:03:29.891 --> 00:03:31.976
You can only feel so much by yourself.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.936
I've had an interesting laboratory
to try to answer the real question

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.516
how somebody's life changes

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.851
if you look at them like those people
that you've given everything to?

00:03:40.875 --> 00:03:42.999
Like all the resources they say they need.

00:03:43.023 --> 00:03:45.809
You gave not a 100-dollar computer,
but the best computer.

00:03:45.833 --> 00:03:48.355
You gave them love, joy,
were there to comfort them.

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:50.975
Those people very often --
you know some of them --

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:52.440
end up the rest of their life

00:03:52.464 --> 00:03:54.889
with all this love, education,
money and background

00:03:54.913 --> 00:03:56.297
going in and out of rehab.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.976
Some people have been
through ultimate pain,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.375
psychologically, sexually,
spiritually, emotionally abused --

00:04:03.399 --> 00:04:05.055
and not always, but often,

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:08.283
they become some of the people
that contribute the most to society.

00:04:08.307 --> 00:04:12.239
The question we've got to ask
ourselves really is, what is it?

00:04:12.263 --> 00:04:13.606
What is it that shapes us?

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.241
We live in a therapy culture.

00:04:15.265 --> 00:04:18.307
Most of us don't do that,
but the culture's a therapy culture,

00:04:18.331 --> 00:04:20.320
the mindset that we are our past.

00:04:20.344 --> 00:04:22.976
And you wouldn't be in this room
if you bought that,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.178
but most of society
thinks biography is destiny.

00:04:26.202 --> 00:04:27.845
The past equals the future.

00:04:27.869 --> 00:04:29.584
Of course it does if you live there.

00:04:29.608 --> 00:04:32.276
But what we know and what
we have to remind ourselves --

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.494
because you can know
something intellectually

00:04:34.518 --> 00:04:36.366
and then not use it, not apply it.

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.628
We've got to remind ourselves
that decision is the ultimate power.

00:04:40.652 --> 00:04:43.356
When you ask people,

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.253
have you failed to achieve
something significant in your life?

00:04:47.277 --> 00:04:48.976
Say, "Aye." Audience: Aye.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.976
TR: Thanks for the interaction
on a high level there.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.976
But if you ask people,
why didn't you achieve something?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.255
Somebody who's working for you,
or a partner, or even yourself.

00:04:58.279 --> 00:05:01.375
When you fail to achieve,
what's the reason people say?

00:05:01.399 --> 00:05:02.542
What do they tell you?

00:05:02.566 --> 00:05:06.875
Didn't have the knowledge,
didn't have the money,

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:11.136
didn't have the time,
didn't have the technology.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.994
I didn't have the right manager.

00:05:13.018 --> 00:05:15.707
Al Gore: Supreme Court.
TR: The Supreme Court.

00:05:15.731 --> 00:05:17.961
(Laughter)

00:05:17.985 --> 00:05:20.533
(Applause) (Cheering)

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.976
(Applause continues)

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.055
TR: And --

00:05:33.079 --> 00:05:35.977
(Applause)

00:05:36.001 --> 00:05:39.097
What do all those, including
the Supreme Court, have in common?

00:05:39.121 --> 00:05:40.495
(Laughter)

00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:45.319
They are a claim to you missing
resources, and they may be accurate.

00:05:45.343 --> 00:05:47.976
You may not have the money,
or the Supreme Court,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.976
but that is not the defining factor.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.957
(Applause) (Laughter)

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.524
And you correct me if I'm wrong.

00:05:58.714 --> 00:06:01.976
The defining factor is never resources;
it's resourcefulness.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.804
And what I mean specifically,
rather than just some phrase,

00:06:04.828 --> 00:06:08.040
is if you have emotion, human emotion,

00:06:08.064 --> 00:06:12.093
something that I experienced from you
the day before yesterday

00:06:12.117 --> 00:06:14.708
at a level that is as profound
as I've ever experienced

00:06:14.732 --> 00:06:17.970
and I believe with that emotion
you would have beat his ass and won.

00:06:17.994 --> 00:06:19.051
Audience: Yeah!

00:06:19.075 --> 00:06:23.742
(Applause) (Cheering)

00:06:23.766 --> 00:06:25.976
How easy for me to tell him
what he should do.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.976
(Laughter)

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.887
Idiot, Robbins.

00:06:30.911 --> 00:06:36.167
But I know when we watched
the debate at that time,

00:06:36.191 --> 00:06:38.478
there were emotions
that blocked people's ability

00:06:38.502 --> 00:06:40.479
to get this man's intellect and capacity.

00:06:40.503 --> 00:06:43.399
And the way that it came across
to some people on that day --

00:06:43.423 --> 00:06:46.798
because I know people that wanted
to vote in your direction and didn't,

00:06:46.822 --> 00:06:48.165
and I was upset.

00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:49.628
But there was emotion there.

00:06:49.652 --> 00:06:51.357
Do you know what I'm talking about?

00:06:51.381 --> 00:06:52.715
Say, "Aye." Audience: Aye.

00:06:52.739 --> 00:06:53.879
TR: So, emotion is it.

00:06:53.903 --> 00:06:57.653
And if we get the right emotion,
we can get ourselves to do anything.

00:06:57.677 --> 00:06:59.597
If you're creative, playful, fun enough,

00:06:59.621 --> 00:07:01.691
can you get through to anybody, yes or no?

00:07:01.715 --> 00:07:03.159
If you don't have the money,

00:07:03.183 --> 00:07:05.712
but you're creative and determined,
you find the way.

00:07:05.736 --> 00:07:07.219
This is the ultimate resource.

00:07:07.243 --> 00:07:09.476
But this is not the story
that people tell us.

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:11.576
They tell us a bunch of different stories.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.309
They tell us we don't have
the resources, but ultimately,

00:07:14.333 --> 00:07:15.897
if you take a look here,

00:07:15.921 --> 00:07:19.263
they say, what are all the reasons
they haven't accomplished that?

00:07:19.287 --> 00:07:21.548
He's broken my pattern,
that son-of-a-bitch.

00:07:21.572 --> 00:07:24.899
(Laughter)

00:07:24.923 --> 00:07:27.277
But I appreciated the energy,
I'll tell you that.

00:07:27.301 --> 00:07:28.378
(Laughter)

00:07:28.402 --> 00:07:29.919
What determines your resources?

00:07:29.943 --> 00:07:33.080
We've said decisions shape destiny,
which is my focus here.

00:07:33.104 --> 00:07:36.200
If decisions shape destiny,
what determines it is three decisions.

00:07:36.224 --> 00:07:37.377
What will you focus on?

00:07:37.401 --> 00:07:39.852
You have to decide
what you're going to focus on.

00:07:39.876 --> 00:07:41.337
Consciously or unconsciously.

00:07:41.361 --> 00:07:44.272
the minute you decide to focus,
you must give it a meaning,

00:07:44.296 --> 00:07:46.185
and that meaning produces emotion.

00:07:46.209 --> 00:07:48.035
Is this the end or the beginning?

00:07:48.059 --> 00:07:51.958
Is God punishing me or rewarding me,
or is this the roll of the dice?

00:07:51.982 --> 00:07:54.976
An emotion creates
what we're going to do, or the action.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.976
So, think about your own life,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.048
the decisions that
have shaped your destiny.

00:07:59.072 --> 00:08:02.058
And that sounds really heavy,
but in the last five or 10 years,

00:08:02.082 --> 00:08:03.629
have there been some decisions

00:08:03.653 --> 00:08:07.490
that if you'd made a different decision,
your life would be completely different?

00:08:07.514 --> 00:08:10.208
How many can think about it?
Better or worse. Say, "Aye."

00:08:10.232 --> 00:08:11.264
Audience: Aye.

00:08:11.288 --> 00:08:13.952
So the bottom line is,
maybe it was where to go to work,

00:08:13.976 --> 00:08:16.829
and you met the love of your life there,
a career decision.

00:08:16.853 --> 00:08:18.819
I know the Google geniuses I saw here --

00:08:18.843 --> 00:08:22.231
I mean, I understand that their decision
was to sell their technology.

00:08:22.255 --> 00:08:25.396
What if they made that decision
versus to build their own culture?

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:28.349
How would the world or their lives
be different, their impact?

00:08:28.373 --> 00:08:30.490
The history of our world
is these decisions.

00:08:30.514 --> 00:08:34.076
When a woman stands up and says,
"No, I won't go to the back of the bus."

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:37.619
She didn't just affect her life.
That decision shaped our culture.

00:08:37.643 --> 00:08:40.162
Or someone standing in front of a tank.

00:08:40.186 --> 00:08:42.976
Or being in a position
like Lance Armstrong,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.544
"You've got testicular cancer."

00:08:44.568 --> 00:08:47.607
That's pretty tough for any male,
especially if you ride a bike.

00:08:47.631 --> 00:08:48.976
(Laughter)

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.709
You've got it in your brain;
you've got it in your lungs.

00:08:51.733 --> 00:08:53.925
But what was his decision
of what to focus on?

00:08:53.949 --> 00:08:56.088
Different than most people.
What did it mean?

00:08:56.112 --> 00:08:58.063
It wasn't the end; it was the beginning.

00:08:58.087 --> 00:09:00.878
He goes off and wins
seven championships he never once won

00:09:00.902 --> 00:09:04.784
before the cancer, because he got
emotional fitness, psychological strength.

00:09:04.808 --> 00:09:07.299
That's the difference
in human beings that I've seen

00:09:07.323 --> 00:09:09.182
of the three million I've been around.

00:09:09.206 --> 00:09:14.991
In my lab, I've had three million people
from 80 countries over the last 29 years.

00:09:15.015 --> 00:09:17.479
And after a while,
patterns become obvious.

00:09:17.503 --> 00:09:21.502
You see that South America and Africa
may be connected in a certain way, right?

00:09:21.526 --> 00:09:24.144
Others say, "Oh, that sounds
ridiculous." It's simple.

00:09:24.168 --> 00:09:26.452
So, what shaped Lance? What shapes you?

00:09:26.476 --> 00:09:30.798
Two invisible forces.
Very quickly. One: state.

00:09:30.822 --> 00:09:31.976
We all have had times,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.793
you did something, and after,
you thought to yourself,

00:09:34.817 --> 00:09:37.976
"I can't believe I said or did that,
that was so stupid."

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.095
Who's been there? Say, "Aye."
Audience: Aye.

00:09:40.119 --> 00:09:42.515
Or after you did something,
you go, "That was me!"

00:09:42.539 --> 00:09:43.976
(Laughter)

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.834
It wasn't your ability; it was your state.

00:09:46.858 --> 00:09:49.778
Your model of the world
is what shapes you long term.

00:09:49.802 --> 00:09:53.334
Your model of the world is the filter.
That's what's shaping us.

00:09:53.358 --> 00:09:54.958
It makes people make decisions.

00:09:54.982 --> 00:09:58.238
To influence somebody, we need to know
what already influences them.

00:09:58.262 --> 00:10:00.071
It's made up of three parts.

00:10:00.095 --> 00:10:02.434
First, what's your target?
What are you after?

00:10:02.458 --> 00:10:03.976
It's not your desires.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.635
You can get your desires or goals.

00:10:05.659 --> 00:10:08.873
Who has ever got a goal or desire
and thought, is this all there is?

00:10:08.897 --> 00:10:10.150
Say, "Aye." Audience: Aye.

00:10:10.174 --> 00:10:13.042
It's needs we have. I believe
there are six human needs.

00:10:13.066 --> 00:10:15.976
Second, once you know what the target
that's driving you is

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.976
and you uncover it for the truth --
you don't form it --

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.735
then you find out what's your map,

00:10:20.759 --> 00:10:23.820
what's the belief systems
that tell you how to get those needs.

00:10:23.844 --> 00:10:26.795
Some people think the way
to get them is to destroy the world,

00:10:26.819 --> 00:10:29.369
some people, to build,
create something, love someone.

00:10:29.393 --> 00:10:31.976
There's the fuel you pick.
So very quickly, six needs.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.471
Let me tell you what they are.
First one: certainty.

00:10:34.495 --> 00:10:36.958
These are not goals or desires,
these are universal.

00:10:36.982 --> 00:10:39.082
Everyone needs certainty
they can avoid pain

00:10:39.106 --> 00:10:40.523
and at least be comfortable.

00:10:40.547 --> 00:10:41.801
Now, how do you get it?

00:10:41.825 --> 00:10:44.910
Control everybody? Develop a skill?
Give up? Smoke a cigarette?

00:10:44.934 --> 00:10:46.976
And if you got totally
certain, ironically,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.286
even though we need that --

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:51.503
you're not certain about your health,
or your children, or money.

00:10:51.527 --> 00:10:53.742
If you're not sure
the ceiling will hold up,

00:10:53.766 --> 00:10:55.385
you won't listen to any speaker.

00:10:55.409 --> 00:10:59.158
While we go for certainty differently,
if we get total certainty, we get what?

00:10:59.182 --> 00:11:00.876
What do you feel if you're certain?

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.553
You know what will happen,
when and how it will happen,

00:11:03.577 --> 00:11:04.676
what would you feel?

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:07.376
Bored out of your minds.
So, God, in Her infinite wisdom,

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.976
gave us a second human need,
which is uncertainty.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.976
We need variety. We need surprise.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.296
How many of you here
love surprises? Say, "Aye."

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.401
Audience: Aye.

00:11:16.425 --> 00:11:19.036
TR: Bullshit. You like
the surprises you want.

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:22.404
The ones you don't want,
you call problems, but you need them.

00:11:22.428 --> 00:11:24.207
So, variety is important.

00:11:24.231 --> 00:11:27.343
Have you ever rented a video
or a film that you've already seen?

00:11:27.367 --> 00:11:29.176
Who's done this? Get a fucking life.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.976
(Laughter)

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.610
Why are you doing it?

00:11:32.634 --> 00:11:35.417
You're certain it's good
because you read or saw it before,

00:11:35.441 --> 00:11:38.135
but you're hoping it's been
long enough you've forgotten,

00:11:38.159 --> 00:11:39.176
and there's variety.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.236
Third human need, critical: significance.

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.535
We all need to feel important,
special, unique.

00:11:43.559 --> 00:11:46.426
You can get it by making more money
or being more spiritual.

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:49.366
You can do it by getting yourself
in a situation where you put

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:52.376
more tattoos and earrings in places
humans don't want to know.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.465
Whatever it takes.

00:11:53.489 --> 00:11:54.776
The fastest way to do this,

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:57.776
if you have no background,
no culture, no belief and resources

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.439
or resourcefulness, is violence.

00:11:59.463 --> 00:12:03.223
If I put a gun to your head and I live
in the 'hood, instantly I'm significant.

00:12:03.247 --> 00:12:04.708
Zero to 10. How high? 10.

00:12:04.732 --> 00:12:07.818
How certain am I that
you're going to respond to me? 10.

00:12:07.842 --> 00:12:08.958
How much uncertainty?

00:12:08.982 --> 00:12:11.676
Who knows what's going to happen next?
Kind of exciting.

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.076
Like climbing up into a cave
and doing that stuff

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:15.380
all the way down there.

00:12:15.404 --> 00:12:16.866
Total variety and uncertainty.

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:20.276
And it's significant, isn't it?
So you want to risk your life for it.

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:23.376
So that's why violence has always
been around and will be around

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.857
unless we have a consciousness
change as a species.

00:12:25.881 --> 00:12:27.876
You can get significance a million ways,

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.799
but to be significant, you've got
to be unique and different.

00:12:30.823 --> 00:12:33.805
Here's what we really need:
connection and love, fourth need.

00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:34.876
We all want it;

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.079
most settle for connection,
love's too scary.

00:12:37.103 --> 00:12:39.580
Who here has been hurt
in an intimate relationship?

00:12:39.604 --> 00:12:42.436
If you don't raise your hand,
you've had other shit, too.

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:44.183
And you're going to get hurt again.

00:12:44.207 --> 00:12:46.467
Aren't you glad you came
to this positive visit?

00:12:46.491 --> 00:12:48.011
Here's what's true: we need it.

00:12:48.035 --> 00:12:51.411
We can do it through
intimacy, friendship, prayer,

00:12:51.435 --> 00:12:52.782
through walking in nature.

00:12:52.806 --> 00:12:55.638
If nothing else works for you,
don't get a cat, get a dog,

00:12:55.662 --> 00:12:59.257
because if you leave for two minutes,
it's like you've been gone six months,

00:12:59.281 --> 00:13:00.967
when you come back 5 minutes later.

00:13:01.011 --> 00:13:03.666
These first four needs,
every human finds a way to meet.

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:06.900
Even if you lie to yourself,
you need to have split personalities.

00:13:06.924 --> 00:13:11.463
I call the first four needs
the needs of the personality.

00:13:11.487 --> 00:13:14.221
The last two are the needs of the spirit.

00:13:14.245 --> 00:13:16.012
And this is where fulfillment comes.

00:13:16.036 --> 00:13:17.831
You won't get it from the first four.

00:13:17.855 --> 00:13:21.141
You'll figure a way, smoke, drink,
do whatever, meet the first four.

00:13:21.165 --> 00:13:22.741
But number five, you must grow.

00:13:22.765 --> 00:13:23.894
We all know the answer.

00:13:23.918 --> 00:13:25.441
If you don't grow, you're what?

00:13:25.465 --> 00:13:27.574
If a relationship or business
is not growing,

00:13:27.598 --> 00:13:28.735
if you're not growing,

00:13:28.759 --> 00:13:31.162
doesn't matter how much
money or friends you have,

00:13:31.186 --> 00:13:32.362
how many love you,

00:13:32.386 --> 00:13:33.629
you feel like hell.

00:13:33.653 --> 00:13:35.244
And I believe the reason we grow

00:13:35.268 --> 00:13:37.228
is so we have something to give of value.

00:13:37.252 --> 00:13:39.963
Because the sixth need
is to contribute beyond ourselves.

00:13:39.987 --> 00:13:42.064
Because we all know, corny as that sounds,

00:13:42.088 --> 00:13:43.674
the secret to living is giving.

00:13:43.698 --> 00:13:45.982
We all know life is not about me,
it's about we.

00:13:46.006 --> 00:13:48.245
This culture knows that,
this room knows that.

00:13:48.269 --> 00:13:49.346
It's exciting.

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:51.964
When you see Nicholas
talking about his $100 computer,

00:13:51.988 --> 00:13:53.327
the most exciting thing is:

00:13:53.351 --> 00:13:55.766
here's a genius,
but he's got a calling now.

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:58.662
You can feel the difference in him,
and it's beautiful.

00:13:58.686 --> 00:14:00.629
And that calling can touch other people.

00:14:00.653 --> 00:14:03.530
My life was touched
because when I was 11 years old,

00:14:03.554 --> 00:14:05.541
Thanksgiving, no money, no food,

00:14:05.565 --> 00:14:06.976
we were not going to starve,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.715
but my father was totally messed up,

00:14:08.739 --> 00:14:11.070
my mom was letting him know
how bad he messed up,

00:14:11.094 --> 00:14:13.449
and somebody came to the door
and delivered food.

00:14:13.473 --> 00:14:16.533
My father made three decisions,
I know what they were, briefly.

00:14:16.557 --> 00:14:18.382
His focus was "This is charity.

00:14:18.406 --> 00:14:20.072
What does it mean? I'm worthless.

00:14:20.096 --> 00:14:22.721
What do I have to do?
Leave my family," which he did.

00:14:22.745 --> 00:14:25.227
It was one of the most painful
experiences of life.

00:14:25.251 --> 00:14:27.420
My three decisions
gave me a different path.

00:14:27.796 --> 00:14:31.118
I set focus on "There's food."
What a concept!

00:14:31.142 --> 00:14:32.219
(Laughter)

00:14:32.243 --> 00:14:35.438
But this is what changed my life,
shaped me as a human being.

00:14:35.462 --> 00:14:37.655
Somebody's gift,
I don't even know who it is.

00:14:37.679 --> 00:14:39.939
My father always said,
"No one gives a shit."

00:14:40.825 --> 00:14:42.299
And now somebody I don't know,

00:14:42.323 --> 00:14:44.857
they're not asking for anything,
just giving us food,

00:14:44.881 --> 00:14:46.058
looking out for us.

00:14:46.082 --> 00:14:48.721
It made me believe this:
that strangers care.

00:14:49.627 --> 00:14:50.859
And that made me decide,

00:14:50.883 --> 00:14:53.950
if strangers care about me and my family,
I care about them.

00:14:53.974 --> 00:14:56.190
I'm going to do something
to make a difference.

00:14:56.214 --> 00:14:58.311
So when I was 17,
I went out on Thanksgiving,

00:14:58.335 --> 00:15:01.588
it was my target for years to have
enough money to feed two families.

00:15:01.612 --> 00:15:04.077
The most fun and moving thing
I ever did in my life.

00:15:04.101 --> 00:15:05.784
Next year, I did four, then eight.

00:15:05.808 --> 00:15:09.543
I didn't tell anybody what I was doing,
I wasn't doing it for brownie points.

00:15:09.567 --> 00:15:11.953
But after eight,
I thought I could use some help.

00:15:11.977 --> 00:15:14.405
So I went out, got my friends involved,

00:15:14.429 --> 00:15:17.606
then I grew companies, got 11,
and I built the foundation.

00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:18.824
18 years later,

00:15:18.848 --> 00:15:22.294
I'm proud to tell you last year we fed
2 million people in 35 countries

00:15:22.318 --> 00:15:23.502
through our foundation.

00:15:23.526 --> 00:15:25.859
All during the holidays,
Thanksgiving, Christmas,

00:15:25.883 --> 00:15:27.886
in different countries around the world.

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:29.011
(Applause)

00:15:29.035 --> 00:15:30.181
Thank you.

00:15:30.205 --> 00:15:33.777
I don't tell you that to brag,
but because I'm proud of human beings

00:15:33.801 --> 00:15:35.708
because they get excited to contribute

00:15:35.732 --> 00:15:38.841
once they've had the chance
to experience it, not talk about it.

00:15:38.865 --> 00:15:40.656
So, finally -- I'm about out of time.

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.539
The target that shapes you --

00:15:43.563 --> 00:15:45.422
Here's what's different about people.

00:15:45.446 --> 00:15:46.631
We have the same needs.

00:15:46.655 --> 00:15:49.522
But are you a certainty freak,
is that what you value most,

00:15:49.546 --> 00:15:50.723
or uncertainty?

00:15:50.747 --> 00:15:54.288
This man couldn't be a certainty freak
if he climbed through those caves.

00:15:54.312 --> 00:15:56.193
Are you driven by significance or love?

00:15:56.217 --> 00:15:57.493
We all need all six,

00:15:57.517 --> 00:16:00.601
but what your lead system is
tilts you in a different direction.

00:16:00.625 --> 00:16:03.761
And as you move in a direction,
you have a destination or destiny.

00:16:03.785 --> 00:16:05.210
The second piece is the map.

00:16:05.234 --> 00:16:07.510
The operating system
tells you how to get there,

00:16:07.534 --> 00:16:08.815
and some people's map is,

00:16:08.839 --> 00:16:11.610
"I'm going to save lives
even if I die for other people,"

00:16:11.634 --> 00:16:12.810
and they're a fireman,

00:16:12.834 --> 00:16:15.750
and somebody else says,
"I'm going to kill people to do it."

00:16:15.774 --> 00:16:18.352
They're trying to meet
the same needs of significance.

00:16:18.376 --> 00:16:20.569
They want to honor God
or honor their family.

00:16:20.593 --> 00:16:22.115
But they have a different map.

00:16:22.139 --> 00:16:26.018
And there are seven different beliefs;
I can't go through them, because I'm done.

00:16:26.042 --> 00:16:27.371
The last piece is emotion.

00:16:27.395 --> 00:16:29.396
One of the parts of the map is like time.

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:31.709
Some people's idea
of a long time is 100 years.

00:16:31.733 --> 00:16:34.408
Somebody else's is three seconds,
which is what I have.

00:16:34.432 --> 00:16:37.203
And the last one I've already mentioned
that fell to you.

00:16:37.227 --> 00:16:38.950
If you've got a target and a map --

00:16:38.974 --> 00:16:40.907
I can't use Google because I love Macs,

00:16:40.931 --> 00:16:43.027
and they haven't made it
good for Macs yet.

00:16:43.051 --> 00:16:44.332
So if you use MapQuest --

00:16:44.356 --> 00:16:46.771
how many have made
this fatal mistake of using it?

00:16:46.795 --> 00:16:48.891
You use this thing
and you don't get there.

00:16:48.915 --> 00:16:52.551
Imagine if your beliefs guarantee
you can never get to where you want to go.

00:16:52.575 --> 00:16:53.652
(Laughter)

00:16:53.676 --> 00:16:55.010
The last thing is emotion.

00:16:55.034 --> 00:16:57.038
Here's what I'll tell you about emotion.

00:16:57.062 --> 00:16:58.537
There are 6,000 emotions

00:16:58.561 --> 00:17:00.850
that we have words for
in the English language,

00:17:00.874 --> 00:17:04.030
which is just a linguistic representation
that changes by language.

00:17:04.054 --> 00:17:06.354
But if your dominant emotions --

00:17:06.378 --> 00:17:09.105
If I have 20,000 people or 1,000

00:17:09.129 --> 00:17:12.181
and I have them write down
all the emotions that they experience

00:17:12.205 --> 00:17:13.206
in an average week,

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:15.160
and I give them as long as they need,

00:17:15.184 --> 00:17:17.473
and on one side
they write empowering emotions,

00:17:17.497 --> 00:17:18.812
the other's disempowering,

00:17:18.836 --> 00:17:21.363
guess how many emotions
they experience? Less than 12.

00:17:21.387 --> 00:17:23.483
And half of those
make them feel like shit.

00:17:23.507 --> 00:17:24.932
They have six good feelings.

00:17:24.956 --> 00:17:26.596
Happy, happy, excited, oh shit,

00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:28.863
frustrated, frustrated,
overwhelmed, depressed.

00:17:28.887 --> 00:17:30.360
How many of you know somebody

00:17:30.384 --> 00:17:33.155
who, no matter what happens,
finds a way to get pissed off?

00:17:33.179 --> 00:17:34.359
(Laughter)

00:17:34.383 --> 00:17:38.724
Or no matter what happens,
they find a way to be happy or excited.

00:17:38.748 --> 00:17:40.752
How many of you know somebody like this?

00:17:40.776 --> 00:17:43.722
When 9/11 happened, I'll finish
with this, I was in Hawaii.

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:46.409
I was with 2,000 people from 45 countries,

00:17:46.433 --> 00:17:48.819
we were translating
four languages simultaneously

00:17:48.843 --> 00:17:50.963
for a program I was conducting,
for a week.

00:17:51.275 --> 00:17:53.516
The night before was called
Emotional Mastery.

00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:55.925
I got up, had no plan
for this, and I said --

00:17:55.949 --> 00:17:59.047
we had fireworks,
I do crazy shit, fun stuff,

00:17:59.071 --> 00:18:00.352
and at the end, I stopped.

00:18:00.376 --> 00:18:03.099
I had this plan, but I never know
what I'm going to say.

00:18:03.123 --> 00:18:04.548
And all of a sudden, I said,

00:18:04.572 --> 00:18:07.620
"When do people really start to live?
When they face death."

00:18:07.644 --> 00:18:09.352
And I went through this whole thing

00:18:09.376 --> 00:18:11.858
about, if you weren't going
to get off this island,

00:18:11.882 --> 00:18:14.075
if nine days from now,
you were going to die,

00:18:14.099 --> 00:18:16.918
who would you call,
what would you say, what would you do?

00:18:16.942 --> 00:18:18.610
That night is when 9/11 happened.

00:18:18.634 --> 00:18:21.500
One woman had come to the seminar,
and when she came there,

00:18:21.524 --> 00:18:24.199
her previous boyfriend had been
kidnapped and murdered.

00:18:24.223 --> 00:18:26.898
Her new boyfriend wanted to marry her,
and she said no.

00:18:26.922 --> 00:18:30.279
He said, "If you go to that Hawaii thing,
it's over with us."

00:18:30.303 --> 00:18:31.539
She said, "It's over."

00:18:31.563 --> 00:18:34.528
When I finished that night,
she called him and left a message

00:18:34.552 --> 00:18:37.516
at the top of the World Trade Center
where he worked, saying,

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:40.069
"I love you, I want you to know
I want to marry you.

00:18:40.093 --> 00:18:41.497
It was stupid of me."

00:18:41.521 --> 00:18:44.919
She was asleep, because it was 3 a.m.
for us, when he called her back,

00:18:44.943 --> 00:18:47.823
and said, "Honey, I can't tell you
what this means.

00:18:47.847 --> 00:18:51.196
I don't know how to tell you this,
but you gave me the greatest gift,

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:52.577
because I'm going to die."

00:18:53.164 --> 00:18:55.502
And she played the recording
for us in the room.

00:18:55.526 --> 00:18:56.951
She was on Larry King later.

00:18:56.975 --> 00:18:58.931
And he said, "You're probably wondering

00:18:58.955 --> 00:19:01.047
how on Earth this could
happen to you twice.

00:19:01.071 --> 00:19:03.553
All I can say is this must be
God's message to you.

00:19:03.577 --> 00:19:06.108
From now on, every day,
give your all, love your all.

00:19:06.132 --> 00:19:08.111
Don't let anything ever stop you."

00:19:08.707 --> 00:19:10.950
She finishes, and a man
stands up, and he says,

00:19:10.974 --> 00:19:12.550
"I'm from Pakistan, I'm a Muslim.

00:19:12.574 --> 00:19:14.767
I'd love to hold your hand
and say I'm sorry,

00:19:14.791 --> 00:19:17.005
but frankly, this is retribution."

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:20.613
I can't tell you the rest,
because I'm out of time.

00:19:20.637 --> 00:19:27.295
(Laughter)

00:19:27.319 --> 00:19:28.495
Are you sure?

00:19:28.519 --> 00:19:32.815
(Laughter)

00:19:32.839 --> 00:19:34.015
10 seconds!

00:19:34.039 --> 00:19:37.347
(Laughter and applause)

00:19:37.371 --> 00:19:39.318
10 seconds, I want to be respectful.

00:19:39.342 --> 00:19:40.478
All I can tell you is,

00:19:40.502 --> 00:19:42.109
I brought this man on stage

00:19:42.133 --> 00:19:45.074
with a man from New York who worked
in the World Trade Center,

00:19:45.098 --> 00:19:47.098
because I had about 200 New Yorkers there.

00:19:47.122 --> 00:19:49.557
More than 50 lost
their entire companies, friends,

00:19:49.581 --> 00:19:51.103
marking off their Palm Pilots.

00:19:51.127 --> 00:19:53.705
One financial trader,
woman made of steel, bawling --

00:19:53.729 --> 00:19:55.554
30 friends crossing off that all died.

00:19:55.578 --> 00:19:58.884
And I said, "What are we
going to focus on?

00:19:59.572 --> 00:20:01.910
What does this mean
and what are we going to do?"

00:20:01.934 --> 00:20:04.006
And I got the group to focus on:

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:05.746
if you didn't lose somebody today,

00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:08.348
your focus is going to be
how to serve somebody else.

00:20:08.372 --> 00:20:11.480
Then one woman stood up
and was so angry, screaming and yelling.

00:20:11.504 --> 00:20:14.420
I found out she wasn't from New York,
she's not an American,

00:20:14.444 --> 00:20:15.773
doesn't know anybody here.

00:20:15.797 --> 00:20:17.559
I asked, "Do you always get angry?"

00:20:17.583 --> 00:20:18.760
She said, "Yes."

00:20:18.784 --> 00:20:20.976
Guilty people got guilty,
sad people got sad.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.675
I took these two men
and I did an indirect negotiation.

00:20:23.699 --> 00:20:26.084
Jewish man with family
in the occupied territory,

00:20:26.108 --> 00:20:29.362
someone in New York who would have died
if he was at work that day,

00:20:29.386 --> 00:20:31.486
and this man who wanted to be a terrorist,

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:32.790
and I made it very clear.

00:20:32.814 --> 00:20:35.731
This integration is on a film,
which I'd be happy to send you,

00:20:35.755 --> 00:20:37.181
instead of my verbalization,

00:20:37.205 --> 00:20:39.305
but the two of them not only came together

00:20:39.329 --> 00:20:41.763
and changed their beliefs
and models of the world,

00:20:41.787 --> 00:20:44.509
but worked together to bring,
for almost four years now,

00:20:44.533 --> 00:20:46.412
through various mosques and synagogues,

00:20:46.436 --> 00:20:48.054
the idea of how to create peace.

00:20:48.078 --> 00:20:50.741
And he wrote a book, called
"My Jihad, My Way of Peace."

00:20:50.765 --> 00:20:52.288
So, transformation can happen.

00:20:52.312 --> 00:20:53.536
My invitation to you is:

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:55.091
explore your web,

00:20:55.115 --> 00:20:56.665
the web in here --

00:20:56.689 --> 00:21:00.277
the needs, the beliefs, the emotions
that are controlling you,

00:21:00.301 --> 00:21:01.478
for two reasons:

00:21:01.502 --> 00:21:03.799
so there's more of you to give,
and achieve, too,

00:21:03.823 --> 00:21:05.111
but I mean give,

00:21:05.135 --> 00:21:07.188
because that's what's
going to fill you up.

00:21:07.212 --> 00:21:09.040
And secondly, so you can appreciate --

00:21:09.064 --> 00:21:11.883
not just understand,
that's intellectual, that's the mind,

00:21:11.907 --> 00:21:14.005
but appreciate
what's driving other people.

00:21:14.029 --> 00:21:16.270
It's the only way
our world's going to change.

00:21:16.294 --> 00:21:18.872
God bless you, thank you.
I hope this was of service.

00:21:18.896 --> 00:21:20.505
(Applause)
