00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Hello. I would like to start my talk

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
with actually two questions, and the first one is:

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
How many people here actually eat pig meat?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Please raise your hand --

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
oh, that's a lot.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And how many people have actually seen

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
a live pig producing this meat?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
In the last year?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
In the Netherlands -- where I come from --

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
you actually never see a pig, which is really strange,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
because, on a population of 16 million people,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
we have 12 million pigs.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And well, of course, the Dutch can't eat all these pigs.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
They eat about one-third, and the rest is exported

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
to all kinds of countries in Europe and the rest of the world.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
A lot goes to the U.K., Germany.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
And what I was curious about --

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
because historically, the whole pig would be used up until the last bit

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
so nothing would be wasted --

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and I was curious to find out

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
if this was actually still the case.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And I spent about three years researching.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And I followed this one pig

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
with number "05049,"

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
all the way up until the end

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and to what products it's made of.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
And in these years, I met all kinds people

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
like, for instance, farmers and butchers, which seems logical.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
But I also met aluminum mold makers,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
ammunition producers

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and all kinds of people.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
And what was striking to me

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
is that the farmers actually had no clue

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
what was made of their pigs,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
but the consumers -- as in us --

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
had also no idea

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
of the pigs being in all these products.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
So what I did is,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I took all this research

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and I made it into a -- well, basically it's a product catalog of this one pig,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and it carries a duplicate of his ear tag

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
on the back.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
And it consists of seven chapters --

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
the chapters are skin, bones, meat, internal organs,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
blood, fat and miscellaneous.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
(Laughter)

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
In total,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
they weigh 103.7 kilograms.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And to show you how often you actually

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
meet part of this pig in a regular day,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
I want to show you some images of the book.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
You probably start the day with a shower.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
So, in soap, fatty acids

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
made from boiling pork bone fat

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
are used as a hardening agent,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
but also for giving it a pearl-like effect.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Then if you look around you in the bathroom,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
you see lots more products

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
like shampoo, conditioner,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
anti-wrinkle cream, body lotion,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
but also toothpaste.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Then, so, before breakfast,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
you've already met the pig so many times.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Then, at breakfast, the pig that I followed,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
the hairs off the pig or proteins from the hairs off the pig

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
were used as an improver of dough.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
(Laughter)

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Well, that's what the producer says: it's "improving the dough,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
of course."

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
In low-fat butter, or actually in many low-fat products,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
when you take the fat out, you actually take the taste and the texture out.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
So what they do is they put gelatin back in,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
in order to retain the texture.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Well, when you're off to work, under the road or under the buildings that you see,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
there might very well be cellular concrete,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
which is a very light kind of concrete

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
that's actually got proteins from bones inside

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
and it's also fully reusable.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
In the train brakes -- at least in the German train brakes --

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
there's this part of the brake

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
that's made of bone ash.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
And in cheesecake and all kinds of desserts,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
like chocolate mousse, tiramisu, vanilla pudding,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
everything that's cooled in the supermarket,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
there's gelatin to make it look good.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Fine bone china -- this is a real classic.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Of course, the bone in fine-bone china

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
gives it its translucency

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
and also its strength,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
in order to make these really fine shapes,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
like this deer.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
In interior decorating, the pig's actually quite there.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
It's used in paint for the texture,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
but also for the glossiness.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
In sandpaper, bone glue

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
is actually the glue between the sand and the paper.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And then in paintbrushes,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
hairs are used because, apparently, they're very suitable for making paintbrushes

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
because of their hard-wearing nature.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
I was not planning on showing you any meat

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
because, of course, half the book's meat

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
and you probably all know what meats they are.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
But I didn't want you to miss out on this one,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
because this, well, it's called "portion-controlled meat cuts."

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
And this is actually sold

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
in the frozen area of the supermarket.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
And what it is -- it's actually steak.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
So, this is sold as cow,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
but what happens when you slaughter a cow --

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
at least in industrial factory farming --

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
they have all these little bits of steak left

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
that they can't actually sell as steak,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
so what they do is they glue them all together

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
with fibrin from pig blood

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
into this really large sausage,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
then freeze the sausage, cut it in little slices

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
and sell those as steak again.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
And this also actually happens with tuna and scallops.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
So, with the steak, you might drink a beer.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
In the brewing process, there's lots of cloudy elements in the beer,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
so to get rid of these cloudy elements,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
what some companies do

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
is they pour the beer through a sort of gelatin sieve

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
in order to get rid of that cloudiness.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
This actually also goes for wine as well as fruit juice.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
There's actually a company in Greece

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
that produces these cigarettes

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
that actually contain hemoglobin from pigs in the filter.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
And according to them,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
this creates an artificial lung in the filter.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
(Laughter)

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
So, this is actually a healthier cigarette.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
(Laughter)

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Injectable collagen -- or, since the '70s, collagen from pigs --

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
has been used for injecting into wrinkles.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And the reason for this is that pigs are actually quite close to human beings,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
so the collagen is as well.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Well, this must be the strangest thing I found.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
This is a bullet coming from

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
a very large ammunition company in the United States.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
And while I was making the book,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
I contacted all the producers of products

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
because I wanted them to send me the real samples

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and the real specimens.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
So I sent this company an email

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
saying, "Hello. I'm Christien. I'm doing this research.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
And can you send me a bullet?"

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
(Laughter)

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
And well, I didn't expect them to even answer my email.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
But they answered

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
and they said, "Why, thank you for your email. What an interesting story.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Are you in anyway related to the Dutch government?"

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
I thought that was really weird,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
as if the Dutch government sends emails to anyone.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
(Laughter)

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
So, the most beautiful thing I found --

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
at least what I think is the most beautiful -- in the book, is this heart valve.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
It's actually a very low-tech

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
and very high-tech product at the same time.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
The low-tech bit is that it's literally a pig's heart valve

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
mounted in the high-tech bit,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
which is a memory metal casing.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
And what happens is this can be implanted into a human heart

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
without open heart surgery.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
And once it's in the right spot,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
they remove the outer shell,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
and the heart valve, well, it gets this shape

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
and at that moment it starts beating, instantly.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
It's really a sort of magical moment.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
So this is actually a Dutch company,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
so I called them up, and I asked,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
"Can I borrow a heart valve from you?"

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
And the makers of this thing were really enthusiastic.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
So they were like, "Okay, we'll put it in a jar for you with formalin,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
and you can borrow it."

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Great -- and then I didn't hear from them for weeks,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
so I called,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
and I asked, "What's going on with the heart valve?"

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
And they said, "Well the director of the company

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
decided not to let you borrow this heart valve,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
because want his product

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
to be associated with pigs."

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
(Laughter)

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Well, the last product from the book that I'm showing you is renewable energy --

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
actually, to show that my first question,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
if pigs are still used up until the last bit, was still true.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Well it is, because everything that can't be used for anything else

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
is made into a fuel

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
that can be used as renewable energy source.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
In total, I found 185 products.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
And what they showed me

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
is that, well, firstly,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
it's at least to say odd

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
that we don't treat these pigs

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
as absolute kings and queens.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
And the second, is that we actually don't have a clue

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
of what all these products that surround us are made of.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
And you might think I'm very fond of pigs,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
but actually -- well, I am a little bit --

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
but I'm more fond

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
of raw materials in general.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
And I think that, in order to take better care

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
of what's behind our products --

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
so, the livestock, the crops, the plants,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
the non-renewable materials,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
but also the people that produce these products --

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
the first step would actually be to know that they are there.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Thank you very much.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
(Applause)
