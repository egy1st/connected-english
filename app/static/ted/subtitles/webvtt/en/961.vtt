WEBVTT

00:00:00.611 --> 00:00:04.835
Fifty-two minutes ago, I took this picture
about 10 blocks from here.

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.903
This is the Grand CafÃ© here in Oxford.

00:00:07.927 --> 00:00:09.225
I took this picture

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:13.994
because this turns out to be
the first coffeehouse to open in England,

00:00:14.018 --> 00:00:15.177
in 1650.

00:00:15.201 --> 00:00:17.318
That's its great claim to fame.

00:00:17.342 --> 00:00:18.850
And I wanted to show it to you,

00:00:18.874 --> 00:00:21.456
not because I want to give you
the Starbucks tour

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.662
of historic England --

00:00:22.686 --> 00:00:23.795
(Laughter)

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:27.267
but rather because
the English coffeehouse was crucial

00:00:27.291 --> 00:00:32.049
to the development and spread of one
of the great intellectual flowerings

00:00:32.073 --> 00:00:33.839
of the last 500 years,

00:00:33.863 --> 00:00:35.668
what we now call the Enlightenment.

00:00:36.161 --> 00:00:40.244
And the coffeehouse played such a big role
in the birth of the Enlightenment

00:00:40.268 --> 00:00:42.763
in part because of what people
were drinking there.

00:00:42.787 --> 00:00:48.044
Because, before the spread
of coffee and tea through British culture,

00:00:48.068 --> 00:00:51.311
what people drank --
both elite and mass folks drank --

00:00:51.335 --> 00:00:53.708
day in and day out, from dawn until dusk,

00:00:53.732 --> 00:00:54.957
was alcohol.

00:00:54.981 --> 00:00:57.030
Alcohol was the daytime
beverage of choice.

00:00:57.054 --> 00:00:59.128
You would drink a little beer
with breakfast

00:00:59.152 --> 00:01:00.707
and have a little wine at lunch,

00:01:00.731 --> 00:01:03.029
a little gin, particularly around 1650,

00:01:03.053 --> 00:01:06.161
and top it off with a little beer and wine
at the end of the day.

00:01:06.185 --> 00:01:09.409
That was the healthy choice,
because the water wasn't safe to drink.

00:01:09.433 --> 00:01:12.526
And so, effectively,
until the rise of the coffeehouse,

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.694
you had an entire population
that was effectively drunk all day.

00:01:15.718 --> 00:01:16.914
(Laughter)

00:01:16.938 --> 00:01:19.930
And you can imagine what that would
be like in your own life --

00:01:19.954 --> 00:01:23.410
and I know this is true of some of you --
if you were drinking all day --

00:01:23.434 --> 00:01:24.465
(Laughter)

00:01:24.489 --> 00:01:27.766
and then you switched from a depressant
to a stimulant in your life.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.334
You would have better ideas.

00:01:29.358 --> 00:01:31.422
You would be sharper and more alert.

00:01:31.446 --> 00:01:34.809
So it's not an accident that a great
flowering of innovation happened

00:01:34.833 --> 00:01:37.001
as England switched to tea and coffee.

00:01:37.025 --> 00:01:39.834
But the other thing
that makes the coffeehouse important

00:01:39.858 --> 00:01:41.869
is the architecture of the space.

00:01:42.288 --> 00:01:44.491
It was a space where people
would get together,

00:01:44.515 --> 00:01:47.254
from different backgrounds,
different fields of expertise,

00:01:47.278 --> 00:01:48.439
and share.

00:01:48.463 --> 00:01:51.866
It was a space, as Matt Ridley talked
about, where ideas could have sex.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.371
This was their conjugal bed, in a sense;
ideas would get together there.

00:01:55.395 --> 00:01:58.087
And an astonishing number
of innovations from this period

00:01:58.111 --> 00:02:01.265
have a coffeehouse
somewhere in their story.

00:02:01.741 --> 00:02:04.590
I've been spending a lot of time
thinking about coffeehouses

00:02:04.614 --> 00:02:05.803
for the last five years

00:02:05.827 --> 00:02:08.785
because I've been kind of on this quest

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:12.527
to investigate this question
of where good ideas come from.

00:02:12.551 --> 00:02:17.803
What are the environments
that lead to unusual levels of innovation,

00:02:17.827 --> 00:02:20.132
unusual levels of creativity?

00:02:20.156 --> 00:02:23.883
What's the kind of environmental --
what is the space of creativity?

00:02:24.517 --> 00:02:26.342
And what I've done is,

00:02:26.366 --> 00:02:28.909
I've looked at both environments
like the coffeehouse,

00:02:28.933 --> 00:02:31.659
I've looked at media environments
like the World Wide Web,

00:02:31.683 --> 00:02:33.691
that have been extraordinarily innovative;

00:02:33.715 --> 00:02:36.116
I've gone back to the history
of the first cities;

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.760
I've even gone to biological environments,
like coral reefs and rain forests,

00:02:39.784 --> 00:02:42.355
that involve unusual levels
of biological innovation.

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:45.267
And what I've been looking for
is shared patterns,

00:02:45.291 --> 00:02:48.750
signature behavior
that shows up again and again

00:02:48.774 --> 00:02:50.175
in all of these environments.

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:52.831
Are there recurring patterns
that we can learn from,

00:02:52.855 --> 00:02:55.333
that we can take
and apply to our own lives

00:02:55.357 --> 00:02:57.762
or our own organizations
or our own environments

00:02:57.786 --> 00:02:59.794
to make them more creative and innovative?

00:02:59.818 --> 00:03:01.251
And I think I've found a few.

00:03:01.275 --> 00:03:04.039
But what you have to do
to make sense of this

00:03:04.063 --> 00:03:06.376
and to really understand
these principles is,

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.631
you have to do away with

00:03:08.655 --> 00:03:11.781
the way in which our conventional
metaphors and language steers us

00:03:11.805 --> 00:03:15.072
towards certain concepts of idea creation.

00:03:15.096 --> 00:03:19.838
We have this very rich vocabulary
to describe moments of inspiration.

00:03:19.862 --> 00:03:22.308
We have the "flash" of insight,

00:03:22.332 --> 00:03:23.842
the "stroke" of insight,

00:03:23.866 --> 00:03:25.552
we have "epiphanies,"

00:03:25.576 --> 00:03:27.287
we have eureka moments,

00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:29.325
we have the "light bulb" moments, right?

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:34.339
All of these concepts,
as rhetorically florid as they are,

00:03:34.363 --> 00:03:35.720
share this basic assumption,

00:03:35.744 --> 00:03:38.248
which is that an idea is a single thing.

00:03:38.761 --> 00:03:44.316
It's something that happens often
in a wonderful, illuminating moment.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.764
But, in fact, what I would argue
and what you really need to begin with

00:03:47.788 --> 00:03:52.166
is this idea that an idea is a network
on the most elemental level.

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.700
I mean, this is what is happening
inside your brain.

00:03:54.724 --> 00:03:57.262
An idea -- a new idea --
is a new network of neurons

00:03:57.286 --> 00:03:59.626
firing in sync with each other
inside your brain.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.894
It's a new configuration
that has never formed before.

00:04:02.918 --> 00:04:06.121
And the question is: How do you
get your brain into environments

00:04:06.145 --> 00:04:09.022
where these new networks
are going to be more likely to form?

00:04:09.046 --> 00:04:12.723
And it turns out that, in fact,
the network patterns of the outside world

00:04:12.747 --> 00:04:16.919
mimic a lot of the network patterns
of the internal world of a human brain.

00:04:16.943 --> 00:04:19.908
So the metaphor I'd like to use,

00:04:19.932 --> 00:04:24.355
I can take from a story
of a great idea that's quite recent --

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:26.968
a lot more recent than the 1650s.

00:04:28.201 --> 00:04:30.241
A wonderful guy named Timothy Prestero

00:04:30.265 --> 00:04:32.896
has an organization
called Design That Matters.

00:04:33.376 --> 00:04:36.970
They decided to tackle
this really pressing problem

00:04:36.994 --> 00:04:40.526
of the terrible problems
we have with infant mortality rates

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.407
in the developing world.

00:04:42.431 --> 00:04:44.880
One of the things
that's very frustrating about this

00:04:44.904 --> 00:04:50.281
is that we know by getting modern
neonatal incubators into any context,

00:04:50.305 --> 00:04:53.608
if we can keep premature babies warm,
basically -- it's very simple --

00:04:53.632 --> 00:04:56.375
we can halve infant mortality rates
in those environments.

00:04:56.399 --> 00:04:58.192
So the technology is there.

00:04:58.216 --> 00:05:01.027
These are standard
in all the industrialized worlds.

00:05:01.051 --> 00:05:04.486
The problem is, if you buy
a $40,000 incubator,

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.889
and you send it off
to a midsized village in Africa,

00:05:07.913 --> 00:05:10.424
it will work great
for a year or two years,

00:05:10.448 --> 00:05:12.877
and then something
will go wrong and it will break,

00:05:12.901 --> 00:05:15.037
and it will remain broken forever,

00:05:15.061 --> 00:05:17.798
because you don't have
a whole system of spare parts,

00:05:17.822 --> 00:05:19.989
and you don't have
the on-the-ground expertise

00:05:20.013 --> 00:05:22.456
to fix this $40,000 piece of equipment.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.528
So you end up having this problem
where you spend all this money

00:05:25.552 --> 00:05:28.685
getting aid and all these advanced
electronics to these countries,

00:05:28.709 --> 00:05:30.109
and it ends up being useless.

00:05:30.133 --> 00:05:32.150
So what Prestero
and his team decided to do

00:05:32.174 --> 00:05:34.949
was to look around and see:
What are the abundant resources

00:05:34.973 --> 00:05:36.673
in these developing world contexts?

00:05:36.697 --> 00:05:37.962
And what they noticed was,

00:05:37.986 --> 00:05:41.200
they don't have a lot of DVRs,
they don't have a lot of microwaves,

00:05:41.224 --> 00:05:44.625
but they seem to do a pretty good job
of keeping their cars on the road.

00:05:44.649 --> 00:05:47.930
There's a Toyota 4Runner
on the street in all these places.

00:05:47.954 --> 00:05:51.285
They seem to have the expertise
to keep cars working.

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:52.594
So they started to think,

00:05:52.618 --> 00:05:55.526
"Could we build a neonatal incubator

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.101
that's built entirely
out of automobile parts?"

00:05:58.728 --> 00:06:00.457
And this is what they came up with.

00:06:00.481 --> 00:06:02.120
It's called the NeoNurture device.

00:06:02.144 --> 00:06:04.637
From the outside,
it looks like a normal little thing

00:06:04.661 --> 00:06:06.822
you'd find in a modern Western hospital.

00:06:06.846 --> 00:06:08.479
In the inside, it's all car parts.

00:06:08.503 --> 00:06:10.721
It's got a fan, it's got
headlights for warmth,

00:06:10.745 --> 00:06:12.364
it's got door chimes for alarm,

00:06:12.388 --> 00:06:14.054
it runs off a car battery.

00:06:14.078 --> 00:06:17.065
And so all you need
is the spare parts from your Toyota

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:18.797
and the ability to fix a headlight,

00:06:18.821 --> 00:06:20.330
and you can repair this thing.

00:06:20.354 --> 00:06:21.506
Now that's a great idea,

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:23.196
but I'd like to say that, in fact,

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.576
this is a great metaphor
for the way ideas happen.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.962
We like to think our breakthrough
ideas, you know,

00:06:27.986 --> 00:06:30.010
are like that $40,000,
brand-new incubator,

00:06:30.034 --> 00:06:31.379
state-of-the-art technology.

00:06:31.403 --> 00:06:33.694
But more often than not,
they're cobbled together

00:06:33.718 --> 00:06:36.165
from whatever parts
that happen to be around nearby.

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:37.720
We take ideas from other people,

00:06:37.744 --> 00:06:40.809
people we've learned from,
people we run into in the coffee shop,

00:06:40.833 --> 00:06:44.172
and we stitch them together into new forms
and we create something new.

00:06:44.196 --> 00:06:46.067
That's really where innovation happens.

00:06:46.091 --> 00:06:48.487
And that means we have to change
some of our models

00:06:48.511 --> 00:06:51.438
of what innovation and deep thinking
really looks like, right?

00:06:51.462 --> 00:06:53.056
I mean, this is one vision of it.

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.653
Another is Newton and the apple,
when Newton was at Cambridge.

00:06:56.677 --> 00:06:58.160
This is a statue from Oxford.

00:06:58.184 --> 00:07:00.863
You know, you're sitting there,
thinking a deep thought,

00:07:00.887 --> 00:07:04.079
the apple falls from the tree,
and you have the theory of gravity.

00:07:04.103 --> 00:07:08.117
In fact, the spaces that have historically
led to innovation tend to look like this.

00:07:08.141 --> 00:07:11.751
This is Hogarth's famous painting
of a kind of political dinner at a tavern,

00:07:11.775 --> 00:07:14.407
but this is what the coffee shops
looked like back then.

00:07:14.431 --> 00:07:18.370
This is the kind of chaotic environment
where ideas were likely to come together,

00:07:18.394 --> 00:07:22.003
where people were likely to have new,
interesting, unpredictable collisions,

00:07:22.027 --> 00:07:23.648
people from different backgrounds.

00:07:23.672 --> 00:07:26.835
So if we're trying to build organizations
that are more innovative,

00:07:26.859 --> 00:07:30.349
we have to build spaces that, strangely
enough, look a bit more like this.

00:07:30.373 --> 00:07:33.780
This is what your office should look like,
it's part of my message here.

00:07:33.804 --> 00:07:37.211
And one of the problems with this is that,
when you research this field,

00:07:37.235 --> 00:07:39.323
people are notoriously unreliable

00:07:39.347 --> 00:07:42.740
when they actually self-report
on where they have their own good ideas,

00:07:42.764 --> 00:07:45.484
or their history of their best ideas.

00:07:45.508 --> 00:07:48.843
And a few years ago, a wonderful
researcher named Kevin Dunbar

00:07:48.867 --> 00:07:52.500
decided to go around
and basically do the Big Brother approach

00:07:52.524 --> 00:07:54.528
to figuring out
where good ideas come from.

00:07:54.552 --> 00:07:56.990
He went to a bunch
of science labs around the world

00:07:57.014 --> 00:08:00.646
and videotaped everyone as they were
doing every little bit of their job:

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:03.027
when they were sitting
in front of the microscope,

00:08:03.051 --> 00:08:05.855
when they were talking to colleagues
at the watercooler ...

00:08:05.879 --> 00:08:07.761
And he recorded all these conversations

00:08:07.785 --> 00:08:10.901
and tried to figure out where
the most important ideas happened.

00:08:10.925 --> 00:08:14.236
And when we think about the classic
image of the scientist in the lab,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.447
we have this image -- you know,
they're poring over the microscope,

00:08:17.471 --> 00:08:19.546
and they see something
in the tissue sample,

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:21.677
and -- "Eureka!" -- they've got the idea.

00:08:21.701 --> 00:08:25.010
What happened, actually,
when Dunbar looked at the tape,

00:08:25.034 --> 00:08:28.272
is that, in fact, almost all
of the important breakthrough ideas

00:08:28.296 --> 00:08:31.391
did not happen alone in the lab,
in front of the microscope.

00:08:31.415 --> 00:08:34.772
They happened at the conference table
at the weekly lab meeting,

00:08:34.796 --> 00:08:38.419
when everybody got together
and shared their latest data and findings,

00:08:38.443 --> 00:08:41.308
oftentimes when people shared
the mistakes they were having,

00:08:41.332 --> 00:08:44.040
the error, the noise in the signal
they were discovering.

00:08:44.064 --> 00:08:46.033
And something about that environment --

00:08:46.057 --> 00:08:48.362
and I've started calling it
the "liquid network,"

00:08:48.386 --> 00:08:51.332
where you have lots of different
ideas that are together,

00:08:51.356 --> 00:08:53.385
different backgrounds,
different interests,

00:08:53.409 --> 00:08:55.850
jostling with each other,
bouncing off each other --

00:08:55.874 --> 00:08:59.338
that environment is, in fact,
the environment that leads to innovation.

00:08:59.362 --> 00:09:01.185
The other problem that people have is,

00:09:01.209 --> 00:09:03.576
they like to condense
their stories of innovation

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.268
down to shorter time frames.

00:09:05.292 --> 00:09:07.958
So they want to tell the story
of the eureka moment.

00:09:07.982 --> 00:09:10.471
They want to say,
"There I was, I was standing there,

00:09:10.495 --> 00:09:12.659
and I had it all,
suddenly, clear in my head."

00:09:12.683 --> 00:09:15.641
But, in fact, if you go back
and look at the historical record,

00:09:15.665 --> 00:09:21.199
it turns out that a lot of important ideas
have very long incubation periods.

00:09:21.223 --> 00:09:23.128
I call this the "slow hunch."

00:09:23.152 --> 00:09:27.683
We've heard a lot recently
about hunch and instinct

00:09:27.707 --> 00:09:30.808
and blink-like sudden moments of clarity,

00:09:30.832 --> 00:09:34.884
but, in fact, a lot of great ideas
linger on, sometimes for decades,

00:09:34.908 --> 00:09:36.365
in the back of people's minds.

00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:39.018
They have a feeling
that there's an interesting problem,

00:09:39.042 --> 00:09:41.717
but they don't quite have
the tools yet to discover them.

00:09:41.741 --> 00:09:44.227
They spend all this time
working on certain problems,

00:09:44.251 --> 00:09:47.535
but there's another thing lingering there
that they're interested in,

00:09:47.559 --> 00:09:48.750
but can't quite solve.

00:09:48.774 --> 00:09:50.409
Darwin is a great example of this.

00:09:50.433 --> 00:09:52.437
Darwin himself, in his autobiography,

00:09:52.461 --> 00:09:56.005
tells the story of coming up with the idea
for natural selection

00:09:56.029 --> 00:09:58.006
as a classic eureka moment.

00:09:58.030 --> 00:10:01.721
He's in his study, it's October of 1838,

00:10:01.745 --> 00:10:04.600
and he's reading Malthus,
actually, on population.

00:10:04.624 --> 00:10:05.808
And all of a sudden,

00:10:05.832 --> 00:10:09.023
the basic algorithm of natural selection
kind of pops into his head,

00:10:09.047 --> 00:10:12.202
and he says, "Ah, at last, I had
a theory with which to work."

00:10:12.226 --> 00:10:14.097
That's in his autobiography.

00:10:14.121 --> 00:10:15.446
About a decade or two ago,

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:17.446
a wonderful scholar named Howard Gruber

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:21.129
went back and looked
at Darwin's notebooks from this period.

00:10:21.153 --> 00:10:22.920
Darwin kept these copious notebooks,

00:10:22.944 --> 00:10:26.035
where he wrote down every little idea
he had, every little hunch.

00:10:26.059 --> 00:10:31.352
And what Gruber found was that Darwin had
the full theory of natural selection

00:10:31.376 --> 00:10:32.985
for months and months and months

00:10:33.009 --> 00:10:37.910
before he had his alleged epiphany
reading Malthus in October of 1838.

00:10:37.934 --> 00:10:39.912
There are passages where you can read it,

00:10:39.936 --> 00:10:43.037
and you think you're reading
from a Darwin textbook,

00:10:43.061 --> 00:10:45.515
from the period
before he has his epiphany.

00:10:45.539 --> 00:10:47.996
And so what you realize
is that Darwin, in a sense,

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:49.823
had the idea, he had the concept,

00:10:49.847 --> 00:10:53.077
but was unable to fully think it yet.

00:10:53.101 --> 00:10:55.984
And that is, actually,
how great ideas often happen --

00:10:56.008 --> 00:10:58.539
they fade into view
over long periods of time.

00:10:58.563 --> 00:11:00.407
Now the challenge for all of us is:

00:11:00.431 --> 00:11:01.873
How do you create environments

00:11:01.897 --> 00:11:04.644
that allow these ideas
to have this long half-life?

00:11:04.668 --> 00:11:06.443
It's hard to go to your boss and say,

00:11:06.467 --> 00:11:08.688
"I have an excellent idea
for our organization.

00:11:08.712 --> 00:11:10.083
It will be useful in 2020."

00:11:10.107 --> 00:11:11.526
(Laughter)

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:13.762
"Could you just give me
some time to do that?"

00:11:13.786 --> 00:11:17.628
Now a couple of companies like Google
have innovation time off, 20 percent time.

00:11:17.652 --> 00:11:20.990
In a sense, those are hunch-cultivating
mechanisms in an organization.

00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:22.787
But that's a key thing.

00:11:22.811 --> 00:11:25.214
And the other thing
is to allow those hunches

00:11:25.238 --> 00:11:27.119
to connect with other people's hunches;

00:11:27.143 --> 00:11:28.398
that's what often happens.

00:11:28.422 --> 00:11:31.200
You have half of an idea,
somebody else has the other half,

00:11:31.224 --> 00:11:33.090
and if you're in the right environment,

00:11:33.114 --> 00:11:35.934
they turn into something larger
than the sum of their parts.

00:11:35.958 --> 00:11:37.110
So in a sense,

00:11:37.134 --> 00:11:40.362
we often talk about the value
of protecting intellectual property --

00:11:40.386 --> 00:11:41.821
you know, building barricades,

00:11:41.845 --> 00:11:45.695
having secretive R and D labs,
patenting everything that we have

00:11:45.719 --> 00:11:48.186
so that those ideas will remain valuable,

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:51.065
and people will be incentivized
to come up with more ideas,

00:11:51.089 --> 00:11:53.292
and the culture will be more innovative.

00:11:53.316 --> 00:11:55.092
But I think there's a case to be made

00:11:55.116 --> 00:11:57.752
that we should spend
at least as much time, if not more,

00:11:57.776 --> 00:11:59.717
valuing the premise of connecting ideas

00:11:59.741 --> 00:12:01.567
and not just protecting them.

00:12:02.549 --> 00:12:04.237
And I'll leave you with this story,

00:12:04.261 --> 00:12:06.613
which I think captures
a lot of these values.

00:12:06.637 --> 00:12:12.147
It's just a wonderful tale of innovation,
and how it happens in unlikely ways.

00:12:12.171 --> 00:12:15.330
It's October of 1957,

00:12:15.354 --> 00:12:17.457
and Sputnik has just launched.

00:12:17.481 --> 00:12:19.526
And we're in Laurel, Maryland,

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:24.030
at the Applied Physics Lab
associated with Johns Hopkins University.

00:12:24.054 --> 00:12:25.277
It's Monday morning,

00:12:25.301 --> 00:12:28.037
and the news has just
broken about this satellite

00:12:28.061 --> 00:12:29.639
that's now orbiting the planet.

00:12:29.663 --> 00:12:32.193
And, of course,
this is nerd heaven, right?

00:12:32.217 --> 00:12:34.527
There are all these physics
geeks who are there,

00:12:34.551 --> 00:12:38.246
thinking, "Oh my gosh! This is incredible.
I can't believe this has happened."

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:41.088
And two of them, two twentysomething
researchers at the APL,

00:12:41.112 --> 00:12:43.200
are there at the cafeteria table,

00:12:43.224 --> 00:12:46.280
having an informal conversation
with a bunch of their colleagues.

00:12:46.304 --> 00:12:48.721
And these two guys
are named Guier and Weiffenbach.

00:12:48.745 --> 00:12:50.704
They start talking, and one of them says,

00:12:50.728 --> 00:12:53.641
"Hey, has anybody tried
to listen for this thing?

00:12:53.665 --> 00:12:57.056
There's this, you know, man-made
satellite up there in outer space

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.435
that's obviously broadcasting
some kind of signal.

00:12:59.459 --> 00:13:01.467
We could probably hear it, if we tune in."

00:13:01.491 --> 00:13:03.878
So they ask around
to a couple of their colleagues,

00:13:03.902 --> 00:13:06.641
and everybody's like,
"No, I hadn't thought of doing that.

00:13:06.665 --> 00:13:08.007
That's an interesting idea."

00:13:08.031 --> 00:13:11.960
And it turns out Weiffenbach is kind of
an expert in microwave reception,

00:13:11.984 --> 00:13:15.848
and he's got a little antenna set up
with an amplifier in his office.

00:13:15.872 --> 00:13:18.576
So Guier and Weiffenbach
go back to Weiffenbach's office,

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.896
and they start noodling around --
"hacking," as we might call it now.

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:25.021
And after a couple of hours,
they start picking up the signal,

00:13:25.045 --> 00:13:28.091
because the Soviets made Sputnik
very easy to track;

00:13:28.115 --> 00:13:31.078
it was right at 20 MHz,
so you could pick it up really easily,

00:13:31.102 --> 00:13:34.352
because they were afraid people
would think it was a hoax, basically,

00:13:34.376 --> 00:13:36.112
so they made it really easy to find.

00:13:36.136 --> 00:13:39.014
So these guys are sitting there,
listening to this signal,

00:13:39.038 --> 00:13:41.433
and people start coming
into the office and saying,

00:13:41.457 --> 00:13:43.055
"That's pretty cool. Can I hear?"

00:13:43.079 --> 00:13:46.000
And before long, they think,
"Jeez, this is kind of historic.

00:13:46.024 --> 00:13:49.140
We may be the first people
in the United States listening to this.

00:13:49.164 --> 00:13:50.323
We should record it."

00:13:50.347 --> 00:13:52.895
So they bring in this big,
clunky analog tape recorder

00:13:52.919 --> 00:13:55.313
and start recording
these little bleep, bleeps.

00:13:55.337 --> 00:13:57.976
And they start writing down
the date stamp, time stamps

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.323
for each little bleep that they record.

00:14:01.383 --> 00:14:02.784
And then they start thinking,

00:14:02.808 --> 00:14:06.051
"Well, gosh, we're noticing
small little frequency variations here.

00:14:06.075 --> 00:14:11.066
We could probably calculate
the speed that the satellite is traveling

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:15.120
if we do a little basic math here
using the Doppler effect."

00:14:15.644 --> 00:14:17.900
And they played around
with it a little bit more

00:14:17.924 --> 00:14:21.733
and talked to a couple of their colleagues
who had other specialties.

00:14:21.757 --> 00:14:22.968
And they said, "You know,

00:14:22.992 --> 00:14:25.713
we could actually look
at the slope of the Doppler effect

00:14:25.737 --> 00:14:29.261
to figure out the points at which
the satellite is closest to our antenna

00:14:29.285 --> 00:14:31.409
and the points
at which it's furthest away.

00:14:31.433 --> 00:14:32.585
That's pretty cool."

00:14:32.609 --> 00:14:35.833
Eventually, they get permission --
this is all a little side project

00:14:35.857 --> 00:14:38.686
that hadn't been officially part
of their job description --

00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:41.209
they get permission to use
the new UNIVAC computer

00:14:41.233 --> 00:14:44.263
that takes up an entire room
that they'd just gotten at the APL.

00:14:44.287 --> 00:14:46.106
And they run some more of the numbers,

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:48.180
and at the end
of about three or four weeks,

00:14:48.204 --> 00:14:50.410
turns out they have mapped
the exact trajectory

00:14:50.434 --> 00:14:52.106
of this satellite around the Earth,

00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:54.300
just from listening
to this one little signal,

00:14:54.324 --> 00:14:57.703
going off on this little side hunch
that they'd been inspired to do

00:14:57.727 --> 00:14:59.538
over lunch one morning.

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:03.050
A couple weeks later,
their boss, Frank McClure,

00:15:03.074 --> 00:15:04.716
pulls them into the room and says,

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:07.011
"Hey, you guys,
I have to ask you something

00:15:07.035 --> 00:15:08.910
about that project you were working on.

00:15:08.934 --> 00:15:11.968
You've figured out an unknown location

00:15:11.992 --> 00:15:16.384
of a satellite orbiting the planet
from a known location on the ground.

00:15:16.774 --> 00:15:18.376
Could you go the other way?

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:20.949
Could you figure out
an unknown location on the ground

00:15:20.973 --> 00:15:23.046
if you knew the location
of the satellite?"

00:15:23.578 --> 00:15:25.488
And they thought about it and they said,

00:15:25.512 --> 00:15:28.496
"Well, I guess maybe you could.
Let's run the numbers here."

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.349
So they went back and thought about it

00:15:30.373 --> 00:15:32.811
and came back and said,
"Actually, it'll be easier."

00:15:32.835 --> 00:15:34.363
And he said, "Oh, that's great,

00:15:34.387 --> 00:15:36.895
because, see, I have these
new nuclear submarines"

00:15:36.919 --> 00:15:37.921
(Laughter)

00:15:37.945 --> 00:15:39.292
"that I'm building.

00:15:39.316 --> 00:15:42.185
And it's really hard to figure out
how to get your missile

00:15:42.209 --> 00:15:44.302
so that it will land
right on top of Moscow

00:15:44.326 --> 00:15:47.915
if you don't know where the submarine is
in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.

00:15:47.939 --> 00:15:50.673
So we're thinking we could
throw up a bunch of satellites

00:15:50.697 --> 00:15:53.400
and use it to track our submarines

00:15:53.424 --> 00:15:56.105
and figure out their location
in the middle of the ocean.

00:15:56.129 --> 00:15:57.658
Could you work on that problem?"

00:15:57.682 --> 00:15:59.923
And that's how GPS was born.

00:16:00.908 --> 00:16:02.075
Thirty years later,

00:16:02.099 --> 00:16:05.565
Ronald Reagan, actually, opened it up
and made it an open platform

00:16:05.589 --> 00:16:07.209
that anybody could build upon,

00:16:07.233 --> 00:16:09.787
and anybody could come along
and build new technology

00:16:09.811 --> 00:16:13.852
that would create and innovate
on top of this open platform,

00:16:13.876 --> 00:16:17.656
left it open for anyone to do
pretty much anything they wanted with it.

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:22.759
And now, I guarantee you,
certainly half of this room, if not more,

00:16:22.783 --> 00:16:24.958
has a device sitting
in their pocket right now

00:16:24.982 --> 00:16:27.741
that is talking to one
of these satellites in outer space.

00:16:27.765 --> 00:16:30.526
And I bet you one of you, if not more,

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:33.672
has used said device
and said satellite system

00:16:33.696 --> 00:16:37.240
to locate a nearby coffeehouse
somewhere in the last --

00:16:37.264 --> 00:16:38.694
(Laughter)

00:16:38.718 --> 00:16:41.526
in the last day or last week, right?

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:44.823
(Applause)

00:16:44.847 --> 00:16:46.419
And that, I think,

00:16:46.443 --> 00:16:48.992
is a great case study, a great lesson

00:16:49.016 --> 00:16:53.960
in the power -- the marvelous, unplanned,
emergent, unpredictable power --

00:16:53.984 --> 00:16:55.978
of open innovative systems.

00:16:56.002 --> 00:16:57.242
When you build them right,

00:16:57.266 --> 00:16:59.372
they will be led
to completely new directions

00:16:59.396 --> 00:17:01.067
the creators never even dreamed of.

00:17:01.091 --> 00:17:02.616
I mean, here you have these guys

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:05.360
who basically thought
they were just following this hunch,

00:17:05.384 --> 00:17:07.264
this little passion that had developed,

00:17:07.288 --> 00:17:09.631
then they thought
they were fighting the Cold War,

00:17:09.655 --> 00:17:13.026
and then, it turns out, they're just
helping somebody find a soy latte.

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:14.184
(Laughter)

00:17:14.208 --> 00:17:16.347
That is how innovation happens.

00:17:16.371 --> 00:17:18.542
Chance favors the connected mind.

00:17:18.566 --> 00:17:19.875
Thank you very much.

00:17:19.899 --> 00:17:25.277
(Applause)
