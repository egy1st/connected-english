WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I want you to take a trip with me.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Picture yourself driving

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
down a small road in Africa,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and as you drive along, you look off to the side,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and this is what you see:

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
you see a field of graves.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
And you stop, and you get out of your car and you take a picture.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And you go into the town,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and you inquire, "What's going on here?"

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and people are initially reluctant to tell you.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And then someone says,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
"These are the recent AIDS deaths in our community."

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
HIV isn't like other medical conditions;

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
it's stigmatizing.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
People are reluctant to talk about it --

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
there's a fear associated with it.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And I'm going to talk about HIV today,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
about the deaths,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
about the stigma.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
It's a medical story, but more than that, it's a social story.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
This map depicts the global distribution of HIV.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And as you can see,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Africa has a disproportionate share of the infection.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
There are 33 million people

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
living with HIV in the world today.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Of these, two-thirds, 22 million

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
are living in sub-Saharan Africa.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
There are 1.4 million pregnant women

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
in low- and middle-income countries living with HIV

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and of these, 90 percent

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
are in sub-Saharan Africa.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
We talk about things in relative terms.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
And I'm going to talk about annual pregnancies

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
and HIV-positive mothers.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
The United States -- a large country --

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
each year, 7,000 mothers with HIV

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
who give birth to a child.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
But you go to Rwanda -- a very small country --

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
8,000 mothers with HIV who are pregnant.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
And then you go to Baragwanath Hospital,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
outside of Johannesburg in South Africa,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and 8,000 HIV-positive pregnant women

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
giving birth --

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
a hospital the same as a country.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And to realize that this is just the tip of an iceberg

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
that when you compare

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
everything here to South Africa, it just pales,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
because in South Africa,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
each year 300,000 mothers with HIV

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
give birth to children.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
So we talk about PMTCT,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and we refer to PMTCT, prevention of mother to child transmission.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I think there's an assumption amongst most people in the public

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
that if a mother is HIV-positive,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
she's going to infect her child.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
The reality is really, very different.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
In resource-rich countries,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
with all the tests and treatment we currently have,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
less than two percent of babies are born HIV-positive --

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
98 percent of babies are born HIV-negative.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
And yet, the reality in resource-poor countries,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
in the absence of tests and treatment,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
40 percent -- 40 percent of children are infected --

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
40 percent versus two percent --

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
an enormous difference.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
So these programs --

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
and I'm going to refer to PMTCT though my talk --

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
these prevention programs,

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
simply, they're the tests and the drugs that we give to mothers

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
to prevent them from infecting their babies,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
and also the medicines we give to mothers

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
to keep them healthy and alive to raise their children.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
So it's the test a mother gets when she comes in.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
It's the drugs she receives

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
to protect the baby that's inside the uterus and during delivery.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
It's the guidance she gets around infant feeding

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
and safer sex.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
It's an entire package of services,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
and it works.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
So in the United States,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
since the advent of treatment in the middle of the 1990s,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
there's been an 80-percent decline

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
in the number of HIV-infected children.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Less than 100 babies are born with HIV

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
each year in the United States

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and yet, still,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
over 400,000 children

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
are born every year in the world today with HIV.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
What does that mean?

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
It means 1,100 children infected each day --

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
1,100 children each day, infected with HIV.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And where do they come from?

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Well, less than one comes from the United States.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
One, on average, comes from Europe.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
100 come from Asia and the Pacific.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And each day,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
a thousand babies -- a thousand babies

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
are born each day with HIV in Africa.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
So again, I look at the globe here

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
and the disproportionate share of HIV in Africa.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
And let's look at another map.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
And here, again, we see

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Africa has a disproportionate share of the numbers of doctors.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
That thin sliver you see here, that's Africa.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
And it's the same with nurses.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
The truth is sub-Saharan Africa

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
has 24 percent

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
of the global disease burden

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
and yet only three percent of the world's health care workers.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
That means doctors and nurses

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
simply don't have the time to take care of patients.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
A nurse in a busy clinic

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
will see 50 to 100 patients in a day,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
which leaves her just minutes per patient --

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
minutes per patient.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And so when we look at these PMTCT programs, what does it mean?

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Well, back in 2001,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
when there was just a simple test

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
and a single dose of a drug,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
a nurse, in the course of her few minutes with a patient,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
would have to counsel for the HIV test, perform the HIV test,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
explain the results, dispense a single dose of the drug, Nevirapine,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
explain how to take it, discuss infant feeding options, reinforce infant feeding,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
and test the baby -- in minutes.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Well, fortunately since 2001,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
we've got new treatments, new tests,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
and we're far more successful,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
but we don't have any more nurses.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And so these are the tests

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
a nurse now has to do

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
in those same few minutes.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
It's not possible --

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
it doesn't work.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
And so we need to find

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
better ways of providing care.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
This is a picture of a maternal health clinic in Africa --

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
mothers coming, pregnant and with their babies.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
These women are here for care,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
but we know that just doing a test,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
just giving someone a drug,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
it's not enough.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Meds don't equal medical care.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Doctors and nurses, frankly,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
don't have the time or skills

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
to tell people what to do in ways they understand.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
I'm a doctor -- I tell people things to do,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
and I expect them to follow my guidance --

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
because I'm a doctor; I went to Harvard --

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
but the reality is,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
if I tell a patient, "You should have safer sex.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
You should always use a condom,"

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
and yet, in her relationship, she's not empowered --

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
what's going to happen?

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
If I tell her to take her medicines every day

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
and yet, no one in the household knows about her illness, so

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
it's just not going to work.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And so we need to do more,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
we need to do it differently,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
we need to do it in ways that are affordable

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and accessible and can be taken to scale,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
which means it can be done everywhere.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
So, I want to tell you a story --

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
I want to take you on a little trip.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Imagine yourself, if you can,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
you're a young woman in Africa, you're going to the hospital or clinic.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
You go in for a test

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
and you find out that you're pregnant, and you're delighted.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
And then they give you another test

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
and they tell you you're HIV-positive, and you're devastated.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And the nurse takes you into a room,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
and she tells you about the tests

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
and HIV and the medicines you can take

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
and how to take care of yourself and your baby,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
and you hear none of it.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
All you're hearing is, "I'm going to die,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
and my baby is going to die."

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
And then you're out on the street, and you don't know where to go.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
And you don't know who you can talk to,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
because the truth is, HIV is so stigmatizing

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
that if you partner, your family, anyone in your home,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
you're likely to be thrown out

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
without any means of support.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
And this -- this is the face and story

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
of HIV in Africa today.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
But we're here to talk about possible solutions

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
and some good news.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
And I want to change the story a little bit.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Take the same mother, and the nurse, after she gives her her test,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
takes her to a room.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
The door opens and there's a room full of mothers, mothers with babies,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
and they're sitting, and they're talking, they're listening.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
They're drinking tea, they're having sandwiches.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
And she goes inside, and woman comes up to her and says,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
"Welcome to mothers2mothers.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Have a seat. You're safe here.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
We're all HIV-positive.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
You're going to be okay. You're going to live.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Your baby is going to be HIV-negative."

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
We view mothers

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
as a community's single greatest resource.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
Mothers take care of the children, take care of the home.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
So often the men are gone.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
They're working, or they're not part of the household.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Our organization, mothers2mothers,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
enlists women with HIV

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
as care providers.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
We bring mothers who have HIV,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
who've been through these PMTCT programs

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
in the very facilities,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
to come back and work side by side with doctors and nurses

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
as part of the health care team.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
These mothers, we call them mentor mothers,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
are able to engage women

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
who, just like themselves, pregnant with babies,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
have found out about being HIV-positive,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
who need support and education.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
And they support them around the diagnosis

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
and educate them about how to take their medicines,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
how to take care of themselves,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
how to take care of their babies.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Consider: if you needed surgery,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
you would want the best possible technical surgeon, right?

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
But if you wanted to understand

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
what that surgery would do to your life,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
you'd like to engage someone,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
someone who's had the procedure.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Patients are experts on their own experience,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
and they can share that experience with others.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
This is the medical care that goes beyond just medicines.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
So the mothers who work for us,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
they come from the communities in which they work.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
They're hired -- they're paid as professional members of the health care teams,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
just like doctors and nurses.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
And we open bank accounts for them

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
and they're paid directly into the accounts,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
because their money's protected;

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
the men can't take it away from them.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
They go through two to three weeks

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
of rigorous curriculum-based education, training.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Now, doctors and nurses -- they too get trained.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
But so often, they only get trained once,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
so they're not aware of new medicines,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
new guidelines as they come out.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Our mentor mothers get trained every single year

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
and retrained.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
And so doctors and nurses --

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
they look up to them as experts.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Imagine that: a woman, a former patient,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
being able to educate her doctor for the first time

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
and educate the other patients

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
that she's taking care of.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Our organization has three goals.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
The first, to prevent mother-to-child transmission.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
The second: keep mothers healthy, keep mothers alive,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
keep the children alive --

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
no more orphans.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
And the third, and maybe the most grand,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
is to find ways to empower women,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
enable them to fight the stigma

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
and to live positive and productive lives with HIV.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
So how do we do it?

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Well, maybe the most important engagement

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
is the one-to-one,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
seeing patients one-to-one, educating them, supporting them,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
explaining how they can take care of themselves.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
We go beyond that;

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
we try to bring in the husbands, the partners.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
In Africa, it's very, very hard to engage men.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Men are not frequently part of pregnancy care.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
But in Rwanda, in one country,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
they've got a policy

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
that a woman can't come for care

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
unless she brings the father of the baby with her --

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
that's the rule.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
And so the father and the mother, together,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
go through the counseling and the testing.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
The father and the mother, together, they get the results.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
And this is so important in breaking through the stigma.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Disclosure is so central to prevention.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
How do you have safer sex, how do you use a condom regularly

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
if there hasn't been disclosure?

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Disclosure is so important to treatment,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
because again, people need the support of family members and friends

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
to take their medicines regularly.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
We also work in groups.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Now the groups, it's not like me lecturing,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
but what happens is women, they come together --

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
under the support and guidance of our mentor mothers --

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
they come together, and they share their personal experiences.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
And it's through the sharing

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
that people get tactics of how to take care of themselves,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
how to disclose how to take medicines.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And then there's the community outreach,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
engaging women in their communities.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
If we can change the way

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
households believe and think,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
we can change the way communities believe and think.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
And if we can change enough communities,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
we can change national attitudes.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
We can change national attitudes to women

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
and national attitudes to HIV.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
The hardest barrier really is around stigma reduction.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
We have the medicines, we have the tests,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
but how do you reduce the stigma?

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
And it's important about disclosure.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
So, a couple years ago, one of the mentor mothers came back,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
and she told me a story.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
She had been asked by one of the clients

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
to go to the home of the client,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
because the client wanted to tell the mother and her brothers and sisters

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
about her HIV status,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
and she was afraid to go by herself.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
And so the mentor mother went along with.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
And the patient walked into the house

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000
and said to her mother and siblings,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
"I have something to tell you. I'm HIV-positive."

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
And everybody was quiet.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
And then her oldest brother stood up and said,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
"I too have something to tell you.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
I'm HIV-positive.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
I've been afraid to tell everybody."

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And then this older sister stood up and said,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
"I too am living with the virus,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
and I've been ashamed."

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
And then her younger brother stood up and said,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
"I'm also positive.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
I thought you were going to throw me out of the family."

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
And you see where this is going.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
The last sister stood up and said, "I'm also positive.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
I thought you were going to hate me."

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
And there they were, all of them together for the first time

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
being able to share this experience for the first time

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
and to support each other for the first time.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
(Video) Female Narrator: Women come to us,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
and they are crying and scared.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
I tell them my story,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
that I am HIV-positive,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
but my child is HIV-negative.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
I tell them, "You are going to make it,

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
and you will raise a healthy baby."

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
I am proof that there is hope.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Mitchell Besser: Remember the images I showed you

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
of how few doctors and nurses there are in Africa.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
And it is a crisis in health care systems.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Even as we have more tests and more drugs,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
we can't reach people; we don't have enough providers.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
So we talk in terms of what we call task-shifting.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Task-shifting is traditionally

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
when you take health care services from one provider

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
and have another provider do it.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Typically, it's a doctor giving a job to a nurse.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
And the issue in Africa

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
is that there are fewer nurses, really than doctors,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
and so we need to find new paradigm for health care.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
How do you build a better health care system?

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
We've chosen to redefine the health care system

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
as a doctor, a nurse and a mentor mother.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
And so what nurses do

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
is that they ask the mentor mothers to explain

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
how to take the drugs, the side effects.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
They delegate education about infant feeding,

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
family planning, safer sex,

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
actions that nurses simple just don't have time for.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
So we go back to the prevention of mother to child transmission.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
The world is increasingly seeing these programs

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
as the bridge to comprehensive maternal and child health.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
And our organization

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
helps women across that bridge.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
The care doesn't stop when the baby's born --

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
we deal with the ongoing health of the mother and baby,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
ensuring that they live healthy,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
successful lives.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Our organization works on three levels.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
The first, at the patient level --

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
mothers and babies keeping babies from getting HIV,

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
keeping mothers healthy to raise them.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
The second, communities --

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
empowering women.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
They become leaders within their communities.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
They change the way communities think --

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
we need to change attitudes to HIV.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
We need to change attitudes to women in Africa.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
We have to do that.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
And then rework the level of the health care systems,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
building stronger health care systems.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Our health care systems are broken.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
They're not going to work the way they're currently designed.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000
And so doctors and nurses

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
who need to try to change people's behaviors

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
don't have the skills, don't have the time --

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
our mentor mothers do.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
And so in redefining the health care teams by bringing the mentor mothers in,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
we can do that.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
I started the program in Capetown, South Africa

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
back in 2001.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
It was at that point, just the spark of an idea.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Referencing Steven Johnson's very lovely speech yesterday

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000
on where ideas come from,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
I was in the shower at the time --

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
I was alone.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000
(Laughter)

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
The program is now working in nine countries,

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000
we have 670 program sites,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
we're seeing about 230,000

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
women every month,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
we're employing 1,600 mentor mothers,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
and last year, they enrolled

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
300,000 HIV-positive pregnant women and mothers.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
That is 20 percent

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
of the global HIV-positive pregnant women --

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
20 percent of the world.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
What's extraordinary is how simple the premise is.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Mothers with HIV caring for mothers with HIV.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
Past patients taking care of present patients.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
And empowerment through employment --

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
reducing stigma.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
(Video) Female Narrator: There is hope,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
hope that one day

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
we shall win this fight

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
against HIV and AIDS.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Each person must know

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
their HIV status.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Those who are HIV-negative

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
must know how to stay negative.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
Those who are HIV-infected

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
must know how

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
to take care of themselves.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
HIV-positive pregnant women

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
must get PMTCT services

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
in order to have

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
HIV-negative babies.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
All of this is possible,

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
if we each contribute to this fight.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
MB: Simple solutions to complex problems.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Mothers caring for mothers.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
It's transformational.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Thank you.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
(Applause)
