00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm going to share with you the story

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
as to how I have become

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
an HIV/AIDS campaigner.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And this is the name of my campaign: SING Campaign.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
In November of 2003,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I was invited to take part

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
in the launch of Nelson Mandela's

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
46664 Foundation --

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
that is his HIV/AIDS foundation.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And 46664 is the number

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
that Mandela had when he was imprisoned in Robben Island.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And that's me with Youssou N'Dour,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
onstage, having the time of my life.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
The next day, all the artists were invited

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
to join Mandela in Robben Island,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
where he was going to give a conference

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
to the world's press,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
standing in front of his former prison cell.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
You can see the bars of the window there.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
It was quite a momentous occasion for all of us.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
In that moment in time,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Mandela told the world's press

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
that there was a virtual genocide

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
taking place in his country;

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
that post-apartheid

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Rainbow Nation,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
a thousand people were dying on a daily basis

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and that the front line victims,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
the most vulnerable of all,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
were women and children.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
This was a huge impact on my mind,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
because I am a woman and I am a mother,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and I hadn't realized

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
that the HIV/AIDS pandemic

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
was directly affecting women in such a way.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And so I committed -- when I left South Africa,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
when I left Capetown,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I told myself, "This is going to be something

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
that I have to talk about.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I have to serve."

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And so, subsequently

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I participated in every single

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
46664 event

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
that I could take part in

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and gave news conferences,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
interviews,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
talking and using my platform as a musician,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
with my commitment to Mandela --

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
out of respect for the tremendous,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
unbelievable work that he had done.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Everyone in the world respects Nelson Mandela,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
everyone reveres Nelson Mandela.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
But do they all know

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
about what has been taking place in South Africa,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
his country,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
the country that had one of the highest incidents

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
of transmission of the virus?

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I think that if I went out into the street now

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and I told people what was happening there,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
they would be shocked.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I was very, very fortunate a couple of years later

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
to have met Zackie Achmat,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
the founder of Treatment Action Campaign,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
an incredible campaigner and activist.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
I met him at a 46664 event.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
He was wearing a t-shirt like the one I wear now.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
This is a tool --

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
this tells you I am in solidarity

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
with people who have HIV,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
people who are living with HIV.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And in a way because of the stigma, by wearing this t-shirt

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
I say, "Yes, we can talk about this issue.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
It doesn't have to be in the closet."

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I became a member of Treatment Action Campaign

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and I'm very proud to be a member

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
of that incredible organization.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
It's a grassroots campaign

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
with 80 percent membership being women,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
most of whom are HIV-positive.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
They work in the field.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
They have tremendous outreach

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
to the people who are living directly

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
with the effects of the virus.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
They have education programs.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
They bring out the issues of stigma.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
It's quite extraordinary what they do.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And yes, my SING Campaign

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
has supported Treatment Action Campaign

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
in the way that I have tried to raise awareness

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
and to try to also raise funds.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
A lot of the funding that I have managed to raise

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
has gone directly to Treatment Action Campaign

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and the incredible work that they do,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and are still continuing to do in South Africa.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
So this is my SING Campaign.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
SING Campaign is basically just me

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and about three or four wonderful people

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
who help to support me.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
I've traveled all over the world

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
in the last two and a half years --

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
I went to about 12 different countries.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Here I am in Oslo in Norway,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
getting a nice, fat check;

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
singing in Hong Kong, trying to get people to raise money.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
In Johannesburg, I had the opportunity to play

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
to a mainly white, middle-class South African audience

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
who ended up in tears

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
because I use film clips

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
that really touch the heart, the whole nature,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
of this terrible tragedy that is taking place,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
that people are tending to avoid,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
because they are fatigued,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and they really don't quite know what the solutions are.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Aaron Motsoaledi, the current health minister,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
attended that concert

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
and I had an opportunity to meet with him,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
and he gave his absolute commitment

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
to try to making a change,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
which is absolutely necessary.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
This is in the Scottish Parliament.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
I've subsequently become an envoy

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
for Scotland and HIV.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
And I was showing them my experiences

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
and trying to, again, raise awareness.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
And once again, in Edinburgh

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
with the wonderful African Children's Choir who I simply adore.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
And it's children like this, many of whom have been orphaned

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
because of their family being affected

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
by the AIDS virus.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
I'm sitting here in New York with Michel Sidibe --

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
he's the director of UNAIDS.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And I'm very honored

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
by the fact that Michel invited me,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
only a few months ago,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
to become a UNAIDS ambassador.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
And in this way, I've been strengthening my platform

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
and broadening my outreach.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
The message that UNAIDS

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
are currently sending out to the world

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
is that we would like to see the virtual elimination

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
of the transmission of the virus

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
from mother to child by 2015.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
It's a very ambitious goal

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
but we believe it can be achieved with political will.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
This can happen.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
And here I am with a pregnant woman,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
who is HIV positive

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
and we're smiling, both of us are smiling, because we're very confident,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
because we know that that young woman

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
is receiving treatment

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
so her life can be extended

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
to take care of the baby she's about to give birth to.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
And her baby will receive PMTCT,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
which will mean that that baby

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
can be born free of the virus.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Now that is prevention

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
at the very beginning of life.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
It's one way to start looking at intervention

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
with the AIDS pandemic.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Now, I just would like to finish off

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
to tell you the little story

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
about Avelile.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
This is Avelile --

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
she goes with me wherever I go.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
I tell her story to everyone

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
because she represents

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
one of millions

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
of HIV/AIDS orphans.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Avelile's mother

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
had HIV virus --

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
she died

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
from AIDS-related illness.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Avelile had the virus,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
she was born with the virus.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And here she is at seven years old,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
weighing no more than a one year-old baby.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
At this point in her life,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
she's suffering with full-blown AIDS

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
and had pneumonia.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
We met her in a hospital in the Eastern Cape

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
and spent a whole afternoon with her -- an adorable child.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
The doctors and nurses were phenomenal.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
They put her on very special nutritious diet

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
and took great care of her.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
And we didn't know when we left the hospital --

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
because we filmed her story -- we didn't know if she was going to survive.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
So, it was obviously -- it was a very emotional encounter

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
and left us feeling very resonant

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
with this direct experience, this one child,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
you know, that story.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Five months later,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
we went back to South Africa

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
to meet Avelile again.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
And I'm getting --

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
the hairs on my -- I don't know if you can see the hairs on my arms.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000
They're standing up because I know what I'm going to show you.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
This is the transformation that took place.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Isn't it extraordinary?

00:07:50.000 --> 00:08:00.000
(Applause)

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
That round of applause is actually

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
for the doctors and nurses of the hospital who took care of Avelile.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
And I take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
So, I would like to say to you,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
each one in the audience,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
if you feel that every mother

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
and every child in the world

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
has the right to have access

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
to good nutrition and good medical care,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
and you believe that the Millennium Development Goals,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
specifically five and six,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
should be absolutely committed to

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
by all governments around the world --

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
especially in sub-Saharan Africa --

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
could you please stand up.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
I think that's fair to say,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
it's almost everyone in the hall.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Thank you very much.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
(Applause)
