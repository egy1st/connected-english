00:00:01.063 --> 00:00:03.317
I am a PhD student.

00:00:03.794 --> 00:00:05.897
And that means I have a question:

00:00:05.921 --> 00:00:09.608
How can we make digital content graspable?

00:00:09.632 --> 00:00:13.185
Because you see, on the one hand,
there is the digital world

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:16.185
and no question, many things
are happening there right now.

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:20.095
And for us humans, it's not quite
material, it's not really there --

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:21.730
it's virtual.

00:00:21.754 --> 00:00:22.976
On the other hand,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.086
we're humans, we live in a physical world.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.071
It's rich, it tastes good,
it feels good, it smells good.

00:00:28.459 --> 00:00:29.620
So the question is:

00:00:29.644 --> 00:00:32.696
How do we get the stuff over
from the digital into the physical?

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.286
That's my question.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.436
If you look at the iPhone with its touch

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.437
and the Wii with its bodily activity,

00:00:38.461 --> 00:00:41.438
you can see the tendency;
it's getting physical.

00:00:41.462 --> 00:00:43.375
The question is: What's next?

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:46.992
Now, I have three options
that I would like to show you.

00:00:47.016 --> 00:00:49.014
The first one is mass.

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.240
As humans, we are sensitive
to where an object in our hand is heavy.

00:00:53.264 --> 00:00:55.340
So could we use that in mobile phones?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.485
Let me show you
the weight-shifting mobile.

00:00:58.509 --> 00:01:00.218
It is a mobile phone-shaped box

00:01:00.242 --> 00:01:03.357
that has an iron weight inside,
which we can move around,

00:01:03.381 --> 00:01:05.174
and you can feel where it's heavy.

00:01:05.198 --> 00:01:07.976
We shift the gravitational center of it.

00:01:08.677 --> 00:01:12.749
For example, we can augment
digital content with physical mass.

00:01:12.773 --> 00:01:14.949
So you move around the content
on the display,

00:01:14.973 --> 00:01:18.322
but you can also feel where it is
just from the weight of the device.

00:01:19.488 --> 00:01:21.999
Another thing it's good for is navigation.

00:01:22.694 --> 00:01:24.676
It can guide you around in a city.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.367
It can tell you by its weight,

00:01:26.391 --> 00:01:29.368
"OK, move right. Walk ahead.
Make a left here."

00:01:29.392 --> 00:01:31.009
And the good thing about that is,

00:01:31.033 --> 00:01:33.411
you don't have to look
at the device all the time;

00:01:33.435 --> 00:01:35.383
you have your eyes free to see the city.

00:01:35.407 --> 00:01:36.943
Now, mass is the first thing --

00:01:36.967 --> 00:01:39.027
the second thing, that's shape.

00:01:39.441 --> 00:01:42.795
We're also sensitive to the shape
of objects we have in our hands.

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:45.355
So if I download an e-book
and it has 20 pages --

00:01:45.379 --> 00:01:46.926
well, they could be thin, right?

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.908
But if it has 500 pages,
I want to feel that "Harry Potter" --

00:01:49.932 --> 00:01:51.094
it's thick.

00:01:51.118 --> 00:01:52.124
(Laughter)

00:01:52.148 --> 00:01:54.976
So let me show you
the shape-changing mobile.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.976
Again, it's a mobile phone-shaped box,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
and this one can change its shape.

00:02:01.632 --> 00:02:03.332
We can play with the shape itself.

00:02:03.356 --> 00:02:05.405
For example, it can be thin
in your pocket,

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:07.072
which we of course want it to be.

00:02:07.096 --> 00:02:10.522
But then if you hold it in your hand,
it can lean towards you, be thick.

00:02:10.546 --> 00:02:12.523
It's like tapered to the downside.

00:02:12.547 --> 00:02:15.021
If you change the grasp,
it can adjust to that.

00:02:16.236 --> 00:02:19.258
It's also useful if you want to put it
down on your nightstand

00:02:19.282 --> 00:02:21.326
to watch a movie or use as an alarm clock.

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.511
It stands.

00:02:22.535 --> 00:02:23.976
It's fairly simple.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.691
Another thing is,

00:02:25.715 --> 00:02:27.812
sometimes we watch things
on a mobile phone

00:02:27.836 --> 00:02:29.824
that are bigger than the phone itself.

00:02:29.848 --> 00:02:31.858
In that case -- like here, there's an app

00:02:31.882 --> 00:02:33.795
that's bigger than the phone's screen --

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:35.694
the shape of the phone could tell you,

00:02:35.718 --> 00:02:38.316
"OK, off the screen, right here,
there is more content.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.971
You can't see it, but it's there."

00:02:39.995 --> 00:02:42.793
And you can feel it,
because it's thicker at that edge.

00:02:42.817 --> 00:02:44.348
The shape is the second thing.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.342
The third thing operates
on a different level.

00:02:48.366 --> 00:02:51.363
As humans, we are social, we are empathic,

00:02:51.387 --> 00:02:53.090
and that's great.

00:02:53.114 --> 00:02:56.183
Wouldn't that be a way to make
mobile phones more intuitive?

00:02:56.207 --> 00:02:58.064
Think of a hamster in the pocket.

00:02:58.088 --> 00:03:01.380
Well, I can feel it, it's doing all right.
I don't have to check it.

00:03:01.404 --> 00:03:02.430
(Laughter)

00:03:02.454 --> 00:03:04.719
Let me show you the living mobile phone.

00:03:04.743 --> 00:03:07.271
So, once again, a mobile phone-shaped box.

00:03:07.295 --> 00:03:10.599
But this one, it has
a breath and a heartbeat,

00:03:10.623 --> 00:03:12.445
and it feels very organic.

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:14.761
(Laughter)

00:03:14.785 --> 00:03:17.082
And you can tell, it's relaxed right now.

00:03:17.106 --> 00:03:19.437
Oh, now -- missed call, a new call,

00:03:19.461 --> 00:03:21.478
new girlfriend, maybe -- very exciting.

00:03:21.502 --> 00:03:23.247
(Laughter)

00:03:23.271 --> 00:03:25.293
How do we calm it down?

00:03:25.317 --> 00:03:28.029
You give it a pat behind the ears,

00:03:28.053 --> 00:03:29.976
and everything is all right again.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.673
That's very intuitive,
and that's what we want.

00:03:32.697 --> 00:03:36.792
So what we have seen are three ways
to make the digital graspable for us.

00:03:36.816 --> 00:03:39.977
And I think making it physical
is a good way to do that.

00:03:40.001 --> 00:03:42.509
What's behind that is a postulation,

00:03:42.533 --> 00:03:46.769
namely, not that humans should get
much more technical in the future;

00:03:46.793 --> 00:03:50.746
rather than that, technology,
a bit more human.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.071
(Applause)
