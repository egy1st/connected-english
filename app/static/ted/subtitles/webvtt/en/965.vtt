00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The Hindus say, "Nada brahma,"

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
one translation of which is, "The world is sound."

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
And in a way, that's true, because everything is vibrating.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
In fact, all of you as you sit here right now are vibrating.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Every part of your body is vibrating at different frequencies.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So you are, in fact, a chord --

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
each of you an individual chord.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
One definition of health may be

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
that that chord is in complete harmony.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Your ears can't hear that chord;

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
they can actually hear amazing things. Your ears can hear 10 octaves.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Incidentally, we see just one octave.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Your ears are always on -- you have no ear lids.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
They work even when you sleep.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The smallest sound you can perceive

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
moves your eardrum just four atomic diameters.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
The loudest sound you can hear

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
is a trillion times more powerful than that.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Ears are made not for hearing,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
but for listening.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Listening is an active skill,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
whereas hearing is passive, listening is something that we have to work at --

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
it's a relationship with sound.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And yet it's a skill that none of us are taught.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
For example, have you ever considered that there are listening positions,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
places you can listen from?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Here are two of them.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Reductive listening is listening "for."

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
It reduces everything down to what's relevant

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and it discards everything that's not relevant.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Men typically listen reductively.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
So he's saying, "I've got this problem."

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
He's saying, "Here's your solution. Thanks very much. Next."

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
That's the way we talk, right guys?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Expansive listening, on the other hand,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
is listening "with," not listening "for."

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
It's got no destination in mind --

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
it's just enjoying the journey.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Women typically listen expansively.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
If you look at these two, eye contact, facing each other,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
possibly both talking at the same time.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
(Laughter)

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Men, if you get nothing else out of this talk,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
practice expansive listening,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and you can transform your relationships.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
The trouble with listening is that so much of what we hear

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
is noise, surrounding us all the time.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Noise like this, according to the European Union,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
is reducing the health and the quality of life

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
of 25 percent

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
of the population of Europe.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Two percent of the population of Europe --

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
that's 16 million people --

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
are having their sleep devastated

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
by noise like that.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Noise kills

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
200,000 people a year in Europe.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
It's a really big problem.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Now, when you were little, if you had noise and you didn't want to hear it,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
you'd stick your fingers in your ears and hum.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
These days, you can do a similar thing, it just looks a bit cooler.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
It looks a bit like this.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
The trouble with widespread headphone use

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
is it brings three really big health issues.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
The first really big health issue is a word that Murray Schafer coined:

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
"schizophonia."

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
It's a dislocation

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
between what you see and what you hear.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
So, we're inviting into our lives

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
the voices of people who are not present with us.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
I think there's something deeply unhealthy

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
about living all the time in schizophonia.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
The second problem that comes with headphone abuse

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
is compression.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
We squash music to fit it into our pocket

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and there is a cost attached to this.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Listen to this -- this is an uncompressed piece of music.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
(Music)

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And now the same piece of music with 98 percent of the data removed.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
(Music)

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
I do hope that some of you at least

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
can hear the difference between those two.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
There is a cost of compression.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
It makes you tired and irritable to have to make up all of that data.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
You're having to imagine it.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
It's not good for you in the long run.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
The third problem with headphones is this: deafness --

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
noise-induced hearing disorder.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Ten million Americans already have this for one reason or another,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
but really worryingly,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
16 percent --

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
roughly one in six -- of American teenagers

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
suffer from noise-induced hearing disorder

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
as a result of headphone abuse.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
One study at an American university

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
found that 61 percent of college freshmen

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
had damaged hearing

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
as a result of headphone abuse.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
We may be raising an entire generation of deaf people.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Now that's a really serious problem.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
I'll give you three quick tips to protect your ears

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and pass these on to your children, please.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Professional hearing protectors are great;

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
I use some all the time.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
If you're going to use headphones, buy the best ones you can afford

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
because quality means you don't have to have it so loud.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
If you can't hear somebody talking to you in a loud voice,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
it's too loud.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
And thirdly, if you're in bad sound,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
it's fine to put your fingers in your ears or just move away from it.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Protect your ears in that way.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Let's move away from bad sound and look at some friends that I urge you to seek out.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
WWB:

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Wind, water, birds --

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
stochastic natural sounds

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
composed of lots of individual random events,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
all of it very healthy,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
all of it sound that we evolved to over the years.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Seek those sounds out; they're good for you and so it this.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Silence is beautiful.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
The Elizabethans described language

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
as decorated silence.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
I urge you to move away from silence with intention

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
and to design soundscapes just like works of art.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Have a foreground, a background, all in beautiful proportion.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
It's fun to get into designing with sound.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
If you can't do it yourself, get a professional to do it for you.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Sound design is the future,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
and I think it's the way we're going to change the way the world sounds.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
I'm going to just run quickly through eight modalities,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
eight ways sound can improve health.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
First, ultrasound: we're very familiar with it from physical therapy;

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
it's also now being used to treat cancer.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Lithotripsy -- saving thousands of people a year from the scalpel

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
by pulverizing stones with high-intensity sound.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Sound healing is a wonderful modality.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
It's been around for thousands of years.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
I do urge you to explore this.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
There are great things being done there, treating now autism,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
dementia and other conditions.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
And music, of course. Just listening to music is good for you,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
if it's music that's made with good intention,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
made with love, generally.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Devotional music, good -- Mozart, good.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
There are all sorts of types of music

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
that are very healthy.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
And four modalities where you need to take some action

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
and get involved.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
First of all, listen consciously.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
I hope that that after this talk you'll be doing that.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
It's a whole new dimension to your life and it's wonderful to have that dimension.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Secondly, get in touch with making some sound --

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
create sound.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
The voice is the instrument we all play,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
and yet how many of us are trained in using our voice? Get trained;

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
learn to sing, learn to play an instrument.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Musicians have bigger brains -- it's true.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
You can do this in groups as well.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
It's a fantastic antidote to schizophonia;

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
to make music and sound in a group of people,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
whichever style you enjoy particularly.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
And let's take a stewarding role for the sound around us.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Protect your ears? Yes, absolutely.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Design soundscapes to be beautiful around you

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
at home and at work.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
And let's start to speak up

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
when people are assailing us

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
with the noise that I played you early on.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
So I'm going to leave you with seven things you can do right now

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
to improve your health with sound.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
My vision is of a world that sounds beautiful

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and if we all start doing these things,

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
we will take a very big step in that direction.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
So I urge you to take that path.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
I'm leaving you with a little more birdsong, which is very good for you.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
I wish you sound health.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
(Applause)
