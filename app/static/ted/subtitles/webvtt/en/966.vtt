00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I got up this morning at 6:10 a.m.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
after going to sleep at 12:45 a.m.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I was awakened once during the night.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
My heart rate was 61 beats per minute --

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
my blood pressure, 127 over 74.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I had zero minutes of exercise yesterday,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
so my maximum heart rate during exercise wasn't calculated.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I had about 600 milligrams of caffeine,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
zero of alcohol.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And my score on the Narcissism Personality Index,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
or the NPI-16,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
is a reassuring 0.31.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We know that numbers are useful for us

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
when we advertise, manage, govern, search.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I'm going to talk about how they're useful when we reflect,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
learn, remember

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and want to improve.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
A few years ago, Kevin Kelly, my partner, and I

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
noticed that people were subjecting themselves

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
to regimes of quantitative measurement and self-tracking

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
that went far beyond the ordinary, familiar habits

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
such as stepping on a scale every day.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
People were tracking their food via Twitter,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
their kids' diapers on their iPhone.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
They were making detailed journals

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
of their spending, their mood,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
their symptoms, their treatments.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Now, we know some of the technological facts

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
that are driving this change in our lifestyle --

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
the uptake and diffusion of mobile devices,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
the exponential improvement in data storage

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and data processing,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and the remarkable improvement in human biometric sensors.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
This little black dot there

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
is a 3D accelerometer.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
It tracks your movement through space.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
It is, as you can see, very small and also very cheap.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
They're now down to well under a dollar a piece,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and they're going into all kinds of devices.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
But what's interesting

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
is the incredible detailed information that you can get

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
from just one sensor like this.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
This kind of sensor

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
is in the hit biometric device --

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
among early adopters at the moment -- the Fitbit.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
This tracks your activity and also your sleep.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
It has just that sensor in it.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
You're probably familiar with the Nike+ system.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I just put it up because that little blue dot is the sensor.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
It's really just a pressure sensor

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
like the kind that's in a doorbell.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And Nike knows how to get

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
your pace and distance from just that sensor.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
This is the strap

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
that people use to transmit heart-rate data

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
to their Nike+ system.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
This is a beautiful, new device

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
that gives you detailed sleep tracking data,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
not just whether you're asleep or awake, but also your phase of sleep --

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
deep sleep, light sleep, REM sleep.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
The sensor is just a little strip of metal in that headband there.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
The rest of it is the bedside console;

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
just for reference, this is a sleep tracking system from just a few years ago --

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I mean, really until now.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And this is the sleep tracking system of today.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
This just was presented

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
at a health care conference in D.C.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Most of what you see there is an asthma inhaler,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
but the top is a very small GPS transceiver,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
which gives you the date and location

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
of an asthma incident,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
giving you a new awareness

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
of your vulnerability

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
in relation to time and environmental factors.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Now, we know that new tools

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
are changing our sense of self in the world --

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
these tiny sensors that gather data in nature,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
the ubiquitous computing

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
that allows that data to be understood and used,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
and of course the social networks

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
that allow people to collaborate and contribute.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
But we think of these tools as pointing outward,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
as windows

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
and I'd just like to invite you to think of them

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
as also turning inward

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and becoming mirrors.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
So that when we think about using them

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
to get some systematic improvement,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
we also think about how they can be useful for self-improvement,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
for self-discovery, self-awareness, self-knowledge.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Here's a biometric device:

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
a pair of Apple Earbuds.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Last year, Apple filed some patents

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
to get blood oxygenation,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
heart rate and body temperature via the Earbuds.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
What is this for?

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
What should it be for?

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Some people will say it's for biometric security.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Some people will say it's for public health research.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Some people will say it's for avant-garde marketing research.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
I'd like to tell you

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
that it's also for self-knowledge.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
And the self isn't the only thing; it's not even most things.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
The self is just our operation center,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
our consciousness,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
our moral compass.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
So, if we want to act

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
more effectively in the world,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
we have to get to know ourselves better.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Thank you.
