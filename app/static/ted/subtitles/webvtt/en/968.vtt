WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So I want to tell you a story -- an encouraging story --

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
about addressing

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
desperation, depression and despair in Afghanistan,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and what we have learned from it,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and how to help people

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
to overcome traumatic experiences

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and how to help them to regain some confidence

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
in the time ahead -- in the future --

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and how to participate again in everyday life.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So, I am a Jungian psychoanalyst,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and I went to Afghanistan in January 2004, by chance,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
on an assignment for Medica Mondiale.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Jung in Afghanistan --

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
you get the picture.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and 70 percent of the people are illiterate.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
War and malnutrition kills people

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
together with hope.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
You may know this from the media,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
but what you may not know

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
is that the average age of the Afghan people is 17 years old,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
which means they grow up in such an environment

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and -- I repeat myself --

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
in 30 years of war.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So this translates

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
into ongoing violence,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
foreign interests, bribery,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
drugs, ethnic conflicts,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
bad health, shame, fear

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and cumulative traumatic experiences.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Local and foreign military

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
are supposed to build peace together with the donors

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and the governmental and non-governmental organizations.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And people had hope, yes,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
but until they realized

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
their situation worsens every day --

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
either because they are being killed

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
or because, somehow,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
they are poorer than eight years ago.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
One figure for that:

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
54 percent of the children under the age of five years

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
suffer from malnutrition.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Yet, there is hope.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
One day a man told me,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
"My future does not look brilliant,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
but I want to have a brilliant future for my son."

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
This is a picture I took in 2005,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
walking on Fridays over the hills in Kabul,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and for me it's a symbolic picture

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
of an open future for a young generation.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
So, doctors prescribe medication.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And donors

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
are supposed to bring peace

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
by building schools and roads.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Military collect weapons,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and depression stays intact.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Why?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Because people don't have tools

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
to cope with it, to get over it.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
So, soon after my arrival,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I had confirmed something which I had already known;

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
that my instruments come from the heart of modern Europe, yes.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
However, what can wound us

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
and our reaction to those wounds --

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
they are universal.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And the big challenge

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
was how to understand the meaning of the symptom

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
in this specific cultural context.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
After a counseling session, a woman said to me,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
"Because you have felt me, I can feel myself again,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
and I want to participate again

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
in my family life."

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
This was very important,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
because the family is central

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
in Afghans' social system.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
No one can survive alone.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And if people feel used, worthless and ashamed,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
because something horrible has happened to them,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
then they retreat, and they fall into social isolation,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
and they do not dare to tell this evil

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
to other people or to their loved ones,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
because they do not want to burden them.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
And very often violence is a way to cope with it.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Traumatized people also easily lose control --

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
symptoms are hyper-arousal and memory flashbacks --

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
so people are in a constant fear

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
that those horrible feelings of that traumatic event

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
might come back unexpectedly,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
suddenly,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
and they cannot control it.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
To compensate this loss of inner control,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
they try to control the outside,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
very understandably -- mostly the family --

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
and unfortunately,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
this fits very well

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
into the traditional side,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
regressive side, repressive side,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000
restrictive side of the cultural context.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
So, husbands start beating wives,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
mothers and fathers beat their children,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
and afterward, they feel awful.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
They did not want to do this, it just happened --

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
they lost control.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
The desperate try

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
to restore order and normality,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000
and if we are not able to cut this circle of violence,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
it will be transferred to the next generation without a doubt.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
And partly this is already happening.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
So everybody needs a sense for the future,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
and the Afghan sense of the future

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
is shattered.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
But let me repeat the words of the woman.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
"Because you have felt me,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
I can feel myself again."

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
So the key here is empathy.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Somebody has to be a witness

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
to what has happened to you.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Somebody has to feel how you felt.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And somebody has to see you and listen to you.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Everybody must be able

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
to know what he or she has experienced is true,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
and this only goes with another person.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
So everybody must be able to say,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
"This happened to me, and it did this with me,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
but I'm able to live with it, to cope with it,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
and to learn from it.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And I want to engage myself

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
in the bright future for my children

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
and the children of my children,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
and I will not marry-off my 13 year-old daughter," --

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
what happens too often in Afghanistan.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
So something can be done,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
even in such extreme environments as Afghanistan.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
And I started thinking about a counseling program.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
But, of course, I needed help and funds.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
And one evening,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
I was sitting next to a very nice gentleman in Kabul,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
and he asked what I thought would be good in Afghanistan.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
And I explained to him quickly,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
I would train psycho-social counselors,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
I would open centers, and I explained to him why.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
This man gave me his contact details at the end of the evening

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
and said, "If you want to do this, call me."

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
At that time, it was the head of Caritas Germany.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
So, I was able to launch a three-year project with Caritas Germany,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
and we trained 30 Afghan women and men,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
and we opened 15 counseling centers in Kabul.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
This was our sign -- it's hand-painted,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
and we had 45 all over Kabul.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Eleven thousand people came -- more than that.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
And 70 percent regained their lives.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
This was a very exciting time,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
developing this with my wonderful Afghan team.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
And they are working with me up to today.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
We developed a culturally-sensitive

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
psycho-social counseling approach.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
So, from 2008 up until today,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
a substantial change and step forward

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
has been taking place.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
The European Union delegation in Kabul

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
came into this and hired me to work

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
inside the Ministry of Public Health,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
to lobby this approach --

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
we succeeded.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
We revised the mental health component

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
of the primary health care services

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
by adding psycho-social care

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
and psycho-social counselors to the system.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
This means, certainly, to retrain all health staff.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
But for that, we already have the training manuals,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
which are approved by the Ministry

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
and moreover, this approach is now part

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
of the mental health strategy in Afghanistan.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
So we also have implemented it already

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
in some selected clinics in three provinces,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
and you are the first to see the results.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
We wanted to know if what is being done is effective.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
And here you can see

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
the patients all had symptoms of depression,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
moderate and severe.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
And the red line is the treatment as usual --

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
medication with a medical doctor.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
And all the symptoms

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
stayed the same or even got worse.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
And the green line is treatment with psycho-social counseling only,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
without medication.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
And you can see the symptoms almost completely go away,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
and the psycho-social stress has dropped significantly,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
which is explicable,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
because you cannot take away the psycho-social stresses,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
but you can learn how to cope with them.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
So this makes us very happy,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
because now we also have some evidence

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
that this is working.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
So here you see,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
this is a health facility in Northern Afghanistan,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
and every morning it looks like this all over.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
And doctors usually have three to six minutes for the patients,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
but now this will change.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
They go to the clinics,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
because they want to cure their immediate symptoms,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
and they will find somebody to talk to

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
and discuss these issues

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
and talk about what is burdening them

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
and find solutions, develop their resources,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
learn tools to solve their family conflicts

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
and gain some confidence in the future.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And I would like to share one short vignette.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
One Hazara said to his Pashtun counselor,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
"If we were to have met some years ago,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
then we would have killed each other.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
And now you are helping me

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
to regain some confidence in the future."

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
And another counselor said to me after the training,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
"You know, I never knew why I survived the killings in my village,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
but now I know,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
because I am part of a nucleus

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
of a new peaceful society in Afghanistan."

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
So I believe this kept me running.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
And this is a really emancipatory and political contribution

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
to peace and reconciliation.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
And also -- I think --

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
without psycho-social therapy,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
and without considering this

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
in all humanitarian projects,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
we cannot build-up civil societies.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
I thought it was an idea worth spreading,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
and I think it must be,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
can be, could be replicated elsewhere.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
I thank you for your attention.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:17.000
(Applause)
