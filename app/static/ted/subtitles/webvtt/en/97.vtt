00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.571
When you have 21 minutes to speak,

00:00:03.595 --> 00:00:06.524
two million years seems
like a really long time.

00:00:06.548 --> 00:00:09.041
But evolutionarily,
two million years is nothing.

00:00:09.065 --> 00:00:11.018
And yet, in two million years,

00:00:11.042 --> 00:00:14.797
the human brain
has nearly tripled in mass,

00:00:14.821 --> 00:00:19.030
going from the one-and-a-quarter-pound
brain of our ancestor here, Habilis,

00:00:19.054 --> 00:00:24.104
to the almost three-pound meatloaf
everybody here has between their ears.

00:00:24.512 --> 00:00:27.907
What is it about a big brain

00:00:27.931 --> 00:00:31.688
that nature was so eager
for every one of us to have one?

00:00:31.712 --> 00:00:33.947
Well, it turns out
when brains triple in size,

00:00:33.971 --> 00:00:37.486
they don't just get three times bigger;
they gain new structures.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.396
And one of the main reasons our brain got
so big is because it got a new part,

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.752
called the "frontal lobe,"

00:00:43.776 --> 00:00:46.474
particularly, a part called
the "prefrontal cortex."

00:00:46.893 --> 00:00:49.339
What does a prefrontal cortex do for you

00:00:49.363 --> 00:00:53.940
that should justify the entire
architectural overhaul of the human skull

00:00:53.964 --> 00:00:55.727
in the blink of evolutionary time?

00:00:55.751 --> 00:00:58.767
Well, it turns out the prefrontal cortex
does lots of things,

00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:04.681
but one of the most important things
it does is it's an experience simulator.

00:01:04.705 --> 00:01:07.033
Pilots practice in flight simulators

00:01:07.057 --> 00:01:09.612
so that they don't make
real mistakes in planes.

00:01:09.997 --> 00:01:12.593
Human beings have
this marvelous adaptation

00:01:12.617 --> 00:01:16.362
that they can actually have
experiences in their heads

00:01:16.386 --> 00:01:18.577
before they try them out in real life.

00:01:18.601 --> 00:01:21.124
This is a trick that none
of our ancestors could do,

00:01:21.148 --> 00:01:24.389
and that no other animal
can do quite like we can.

00:01:24.413 --> 00:01:25.943
It's a marvelous adaptation.

00:01:25.967 --> 00:01:29.834
It's up there with opposable thumbs
and standing upright and language

00:01:29.858 --> 00:01:33.278
as one of the things that got
our species out of the trees

00:01:33.302 --> 00:01:35.455
and into the shopping mall.

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:37.391
(Laughter)

00:01:37.415 --> 00:01:39.288
All of you have done this.

00:01:39.312 --> 00:01:42.552
Ben and Jerry's doesn't have
"liver and onion" ice cream,

00:01:42.576 --> 00:01:45.984
and it's not because they whipped
some up, tried it and went, "Yuck!"

00:01:46.008 --> 00:01:49.030
It's because, without
leaving your armchair,

00:01:49.054 --> 00:01:53.461
you can simulate that flavor
and say "yuck" before you make it.

00:01:55.652 --> 00:01:58.224
Let's see how your experience
simulators are working.

00:01:58.248 --> 00:02:00.087
Let's just run a quick diagnostic

00:02:00.111 --> 00:02:02.249
before I proceed
with the rest of the talk.

00:02:02.273 --> 00:02:05.988
Here's two different futures
that I invite you to contemplate.

00:02:06.012 --> 00:02:10.038
You can try to simulate them and tell me
which one you think you might prefer.

00:02:10.062 --> 00:02:15.596
One of them is winning the lottery.
This is about 314 million dollars.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.500
And the other is becoming paraplegic.

00:02:18.524 --> 00:02:19.542
(Laughter)

00:02:19.566 --> 00:02:21.194
Just give it a moment of thought.

00:02:21.218 --> 00:02:24.029
You probably don't feel
like you need a moment of thought.

00:02:24.053 --> 00:02:28.171
Interestingly, there are data
on these two groups of people,

00:02:28.195 --> 00:02:30.173
data on how happy they are.

00:02:30.197 --> 00:02:32.891
And this is exactly
what you expected, isn't it?

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.014
But these aren't the data.
I made these up!

00:02:36.038 --> 00:02:37.228
These are the data.

00:02:37.714 --> 00:02:41.210
You failed the pop quiz, and you're hardly
five minutes into the lecture.

00:02:41.234 --> 00:02:45.406
Because the fact is that a year
after losing the use of their legs

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.807
and a year after winning the lotto,

00:02:47.831 --> 00:02:52.922
lottery winners and paraplegics
are equally happy with their lives.

00:02:53.356 --> 00:02:55.812
Don't feel too bad
about failing the first pop quiz,

00:02:55.836 --> 00:02:59.463
because everybody fails
all of the pop quizzes all of the time.

00:02:59.795 --> 00:03:02.184
The research that my laboratory
has been doing,

00:03:02.208 --> 00:03:05.541
that economists and psychologists
around the country have been doing,

00:03:05.565 --> 00:03:08.361
has revealed something
really quite startling to us,

00:03:08.385 --> 00:03:10.230
something we call the "impact bias,"

00:03:10.254 --> 00:03:13.771
which is the tendency
for the simulator to work badly,

00:03:13.795 --> 00:03:18.934
for the simulator to make you believe
that different outcomes are more different

00:03:18.958 --> 00:03:20.482
than, in fact, they really are.

00:03:20.506 --> 00:03:22.684
From field studies to laboratory studies,

00:03:22.708 --> 00:03:25.067
we see that winning or losing an election,

00:03:25.091 --> 00:03:27.355
gaining or losing a romantic partner,

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:29.109
getting or not getting a promotion,

00:03:29.133 --> 00:03:31.298
passing or not passing a college test,

00:03:31.322 --> 00:03:32.881
on and on,

00:03:32.905 --> 00:03:37.220
have far less impact, less intensity
and much less duration

00:03:37.244 --> 00:03:39.710
than people expect them to have.

00:03:40.974 --> 00:03:46.061
A recent study -- this almost floors me --

00:03:46.085 --> 00:03:50.626
a recent study showing
how major life traumas affect people

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.629
suggests that if it happened
over three months ago,

00:03:53.653 --> 00:03:55.204
with only a few exceptions,

00:03:55.228 --> 00:03:58.161
it has no impact whatsoever
on your happiness.

00:03:59.861 --> 00:04:01.011
Why?

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:05.190
Because happiness can be synthesized.

00:04:05.214 --> 00:04:09.431
Sir Thomas Brown wrote in 1642,
"I am the happiest man alive.

00:04:09.455 --> 00:04:14.571
I have that in me that can convert poverty
to riches, adversity to prosperity.

00:04:14.595 --> 00:04:19.541
I am more invulnerable than Achilles;
fortune hath not one place to hit me."

00:04:19.565 --> 00:04:22.754
What kind of remarkable machinery
does this guy have in his head?

00:04:22.778 --> 00:04:28.034
Well, it turns out it's precisely the same
remarkable machinery that all of us have.

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:30.498
Human beings have something

00:04:30.522 --> 00:04:33.904
that we might think of
as a "psychological immune system,"

00:04:33.928 --> 00:04:38.520
a system of cognitive processes, largely
nonconscious cognitive processes,

00:04:38.544 --> 00:04:42.153
that help them change
their views of the world,

00:04:42.177 --> 00:04:44.612
so that they can feel better
about the worlds

00:04:44.636 --> 00:04:46.842
in which they find themselves.

00:04:46.866 --> 00:04:49.175
Like Sir Thomas, you have this machine.

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:53.033
Unlike Sir Thomas,
you seem not to know it.

00:04:53.486 --> 00:04:58.571
We synthesize happiness, but we think
happiness is a thing to be found.

00:04:58.595 --> 00:05:00.269
Now, you don't need me to give you

00:05:00.293 --> 00:05:04.429
too many examples of people
synthesizing happiness, I suspect,

00:05:04.453 --> 00:05:07.110
though I'm going to show
you some experimental evidence.

00:05:07.134 --> 00:05:09.270
You don't have to look
very far for evidence.

00:05:09.294 --> 00:05:11.081
I took a copy of the "New York Times"

00:05:11.105 --> 00:05:14.234
and tried to find some instances
of people synthesizing happiness.

00:05:14.258 --> 00:05:16.276
Here are three guys
synthesizing happiness.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.842
"I'm better off physically,
financially, mentally ..."

00:05:18.866 --> 00:05:21.938
"I don't have one minute's regret.
It was a glorious experience."

00:05:21.962 --> 00:05:23.870
"I believe it turned out for the best."

00:05:23.894 --> 00:05:26.109
Who are these characters
who are so damn happy?

00:05:26.133 --> 00:05:27.480
The first one is Jim Wright.

00:05:27.504 --> 00:05:29.376
Some of you are old enough to remember:

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.864
he was the chairman
of the House of Representatives,

00:05:31.888 --> 00:05:33.196
and he resigned in disgrace

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.148
when this young Republican named
Newt Gingrich found out about

00:05:36.172 --> 00:05:37.840
a shady book deal that he had done.

00:05:37.864 --> 00:05:39.023
He lost everything.

00:05:39.047 --> 00:05:41.784
The most powerful Democrat
in the country lost everything:

00:05:41.808 --> 00:05:43.580
he lost his money, he lost his power.

00:05:43.604 --> 00:05:46.252
What does he have to say
all these years later about it?

00:05:46.276 --> 00:05:49.016
"I am so much better off physically,
financially, mentally

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.523
and in almost every other way."

00:05:50.547 --> 00:05:52.753
What other way would there be
to be better off?

00:05:52.777 --> 00:05:55.138
Vegetably? Minerally? Animally?

00:05:55.162 --> 00:05:56.997
He's pretty much covered them there.

00:05:57.021 --> 00:05:59.437
Moreese Bickham is somebody
you've never heard of.

00:05:59.461 --> 00:06:02.512
Moreese Bickham uttered
these words upon being released.

00:06:02.536 --> 00:06:03.727
He was 78 years old.

00:06:03.751 --> 00:06:06.492
He'd spent 37 years
in Louisiana State Penitentiary

00:06:06.516 --> 00:06:08.069
for a crime he didn't commit.

00:06:08.093 --> 00:06:12.225
He was ultimately [released for good
behavior halfway through his sentence.]

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:14.353
What did he have to say
about his experience?

00:06:14.377 --> 00:06:17.464
"I don't have one minute's regret.
It was a glorious experience."

00:06:17.488 --> 00:06:18.652
Glorious!

00:06:18.676 --> 00:06:21.846
This guy's not saying, "There were
some nice guys. They had a gym."

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:25.893
"Glorious" -- a word we usually reserve
for something like a religious experience.

00:06:25.917 --> 00:06:28.129
Harry S. Langerman uttered these words.

00:06:28.153 --> 00:06:30.532
He's somebody you might
have known but didn't,

00:06:30.556 --> 00:06:33.388
because in 1949, he read
a little article in the paper

00:06:33.412 --> 00:06:36.705
about a hamburger stand owned
by these two brothers named McDonald.

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:38.834
And he thought,
"That's a really neat idea!"

00:06:38.858 --> 00:06:40.042
So he went to find them.

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:43.159
They said, "We can give you
a franchise on this for 3,000 bucks."

00:06:43.183 --> 00:06:46.448
Harry went back to New York,
asked his brother, an investment banker,

00:06:46.472 --> 00:06:49.554
to loan him 3,000 dollars,
and his brother's immortal words were,

00:06:49.578 --> 00:06:51.296
"You idiot, nobody eats hamburgers."

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.810
He wouldn't lend him the money.

00:06:52.834 --> 00:06:55.905
Of course, six months later,
Ray Kroc had exactly the same idea.

00:06:55.929 --> 00:06:57.968
It turns out, people do eat hamburgers,

00:06:57.992 --> 00:07:01.320
and Ray Kroc, for a while,
became the richest man in America.

00:07:01.864 --> 00:07:03.022
And then, finally,

00:07:03.046 --> 00:07:06.506
some of you recognize
this young photo of Pete Best,

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:08.939
who was the original
drummer for the Beatles,

00:07:08.963 --> 00:07:12.522
until they, you know, sent him
out on an errand and snuck away

00:07:12.546 --> 00:07:14.506
and picked up Ringo on a tour.

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:16.826
Well, in 1994, when Pete Best
was interviewed --

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:19.886
yes, he's still a drummer;
yes, he's a studio musician --

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:23.417
he had this to say: "I'm happier
than I would have been with the Beatles."

00:07:23.441 --> 00:07:26.573
OK, there's something important
to be learned from these people,

00:07:26.597 --> 00:07:28.472
and it is the secret of happiness.

00:07:28.496 --> 00:07:30.869
Here it is, finally to be revealed.

00:07:30.893 --> 00:07:33.587
First: accrue wealth, power and prestige,

00:07:33.611 --> 00:07:34.783
then lose it.

00:07:34.807 --> 00:07:36.791
(Laughter)

00:07:36.815 --> 00:07:40.761
Second: spend as much of your life
in prison as you possibly can.

00:07:40.785 --> 00:07:41.787
(Laughter)

00:07:41.811 --> 00:07:44.992
Third: make somebody else
really, really rich.

00:07:45.016 --> 00:07:47.599
And finally: never, ever join the Beatles.

00:07:47.623 --> 00:07:48.647
(Laughter)

00:07:48.671 --> 00:07:49.822
Yeah, right.

00:07:49.846 --> 00:07:51.932
Because when people synthesize happiness,

00:07:51.956 --> 00:07:54.150
as these gentlemen seem to have done,

00:07:54.174 --> 00:07:57.953
we all smile at them,
but we kind of roll our eyes and say,

00:07:57.977 --> 00:08:00.398
"Yeah, right, you never
really wanted the job."

00:08:00.422 --> 00:08:04.513
"Oh yeah, right -- you really didn't have
that much in common with her,

00:08:04.537 --> 00:08:06.633
and you figured that out
just about the time

00:08:06.657 --> 00:08:08.753
she threw the engagement
ring in your face."

00:08:08.777 --> 00:08:09.928
We smirk,

00:08:09.952 --> 00:08:13.862
because we believe that synthetic
happiness is not of the same quality

00:08:13.886 --> 00:08:16.085
as what we might call "natural happiness."

00:08:16.109 --> 00:08:17.489
What are these terms?

00:08:17.513 --> 00:08:20.917
Natural happiness is what we get
when we get what we wanted,

00:08:20.941 --> 00:08:25.845
and synthetic happiness is what we make
when we don't get what we wanted.

00:08:25.869 --> 00:08:28.914
And in our society,
we have a strong belief

00:08:28.938 --> 00:08:31.979
that synthetic happiness
is of an inferior kind.

00:08:32.003 --> 00:08:33.526
Why do we have that belief?

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:35.574
Well, it's very simple.

00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:39.591
What kind of economic engine
would keep churning

00:08:39.615 --> 00:08:42.351
if we believed
that not getting what we want

00:08:42.375 --> 00:08:45.081
could make us just as happy as getting it?

00:08:45.844 --> 00:08:49.061
With all apologies
to my friend Matthieu Ricard,

00:08:49.085 --> 00:08:51.173
a shopping mall full of Zen monks

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:53.399
is not going to be
particularly profitable,

00:08:53.423 --> 00:08:55.937
because they don't want stuff enough.

00:08:55.961 --> 00:08:57.042
(Laughter)

00:08:57.066 --> 00:08:58.897
I want to suggest to you

00:08:58.921 --> 00:09:02.914
that synthetic happiness
is every bit as real and enduring

00:09:02.938 --> 00:09:05.067
as the kind of happiness you stumble upon

00:09:05.091 --> 00:09:07.833
when you get exactly
what you were aiming for.

00:09:07.857 --> 00:09:10.878
Now, I'm a scientist, so I'm going
to do this not with rhetoric,

00:09:10.902 --> 00:09:13.064
but by marinating you
in a little bit of data.

00:09:13.088 --> 00:09:15.312
Let me first show you
an experimental paradigm

00:09:15.336 --> 00:09:19.025
that's used to demonstrate
the synthesis of happiness

00:09:19.049 --> 00:09:20.206
among regular old folks.

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:21.396
This isn't mine,

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:24.357
it's a 50-year-old paradigm
called the "free choice paradigm."

00:09:24.381 --> 00:09:25.551
It's very simple.

00:09:25.575 --> 00:09:28.122
You bring in, say, six objects,

00:09:28.146 --> 00:09:31.407
and you ask a subject to rank them
from the most to the least liked.

00:09:31.431 --> 00:09:33.989
In this case, because
this experiment uses them,

00:09:34.013 --> 00:09:35.864
these are Monet prints.

00:09:35.888 --> 00:09:39.047
Everybody ranks these Monet prints
from the one they like the most

00:09:39.071 --> 00:09:40.563
to the one they like the least.

00:09:40.587 --> 00:09:42.312
Now we give you a choice:

00:09:42.336 --> 00:09:44.751
"We happen to have
some extra prints in the closet.

00:09:44.775 --> 00:09:47.393
We're going to give you one
as your prize to take home.

00:09:47.417 --> 00:09:51.498
We happen to have number three
and number four," we tell the subject.

00:09:51.522 --> 00:09:53.246
This is a bit of a difficult choice,

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:55.865
because neither one is preferred
strongly to the other,

00:09:55.889 --> 00:09:58.518
but naturally, people tend
to pick number three,

00:09:58.542 --> 00:10:01.255
because they liked it
a little better than number four.

00:10:01.764 --> 00:10:05.375
Sometime later -- it could be
15 minutes, it could be 15 days --

00:10:05.399 --> 00:10:07.470
the same stimuli are put
before the subject,

00:10:07.494 --> 00:10:10.033
and the subject is asked
to re-rank the stimuli.

00:10:10.057 --> 00:10:12.207
"Tell us how much you like them now."

00:10:12.231 --> 00:10:13.437
What happens?

00:10:13.461 --> 00:10:15.346
Watch as happiness is synthesized.

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:18.565
This is the result that's been replicated
over and over again.

00:10:18.589 --> 00:10:20.580
You're watching happiness be synthesized.

00:10:20.604 --> 00:10:22.096
Would you like to see it again?

00:10:23.023 --> 00:10:24.176
Happiness!

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.602
"The one I got is really
better than I thought!

00:10:26.626 --> 00:10:29.165
That other one I didn't get sucks!"

00:10:29.189 --> 00:10:30.950
That's the synthesis of happiness.

00:10:30.974 --> 00:10:32.624
(Laughter)

00:10:32.648 --> 00:10:34.786
Now, what's the right response to that?

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:36.391
"Yeah, right!"

00:10:37.334 --> 00:10:39.482
Now, here's the experiment we did,

00:10:39.506 --> 00:10:41.468
and I hope this is going to convince you

00:10:41.492 --> 00:10:43.722
that "Yeah, right!"
was not the right response.

00:10:43.746 --> 00:10:45.938
We did this experiment
with a group of patients

00:10:45.962 --> 00:10:47.299
who had anterograde amnesia.

00:10:47.323 --> 00:10:48.982
These are hospitalized patients.

00:10:49.006 --> 00:10:51.171
Most of them have Korsakoff syndrome,

00:10:51.195 --> 00:10:53.352
a polyneuritic psychosis.

00:10:53.955 --> 00:10:57.856
They drank way too much,
and they can't make new memories.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.329
They remember their childhood,
but if you walk in and introduce yourself

00:11:01.353 --> 00:11:02.546
and then leave the room,

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:04.966
when you come back,
they don't know who you are.

00:11:06.019 --> 00:11:08.879
We took our Monet prints to the hospital.

00:11:09.391 --> 00:11:12.771
And we asked these patients to rank them

00:11:12.795 --> 00:11:16.069
from the one they liked the most
to the one they liked the least.

00:11:16.093 --> 00:11:19.945
We then gave them the choice
between number three and number four.

00:11:19.969 --> 00:11:21.491
Like everybody else, they said,

00:11:21.515 --> 00:11:24.206
"Gee, thanks Doc! That's great!
I could use a new print.

00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:25.836
I'll take number three."

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:29.392
We explained we would have
number three mailed to them.

00:11:29.416 --> 00:11:31.322
We gathered up our materials,

00:11:31.346 --> 00:11:33.967
and we went out of the room
and counted to a half hour.

00:11:33.991 --> 00:11:34.993
(Laughter)

00:11:35.017 --> 00:11:38.312
Back into the room,
we say, "Hi, we're back."

00:11:38.336 --> 00:11:41.988
The patients, bless them,
say, "Ah, Doc, I'm sorry,

00:11:42.012 --> 00:11:44.242
I've got a memory problem;
that's why I'm here.

00:11:44.266 --> 00:11:46.297
If I've met you before, I don't remember."

00:11:46.321 --> 00:11:49.796
"Really, Jim, you don't remember?
I was just here with the Monet prints?"

00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:52.012
"Sorry, Doc, I just don't have a clue."

00:11:52.036 --> 00:11:53.620
"No problem, Jim.

00:11:53.644 --> 00:11:55.893
All I want you to do is rank these for me,

00:11:55.917 --> 00:11:59.513
from the one you like the most
to the one you like the least."

00:11:59.966 --> 00:12:01.117
What do they do?

00:12:01.141 --> 00:12:04.081
Well, let's first check and make sure
they're really amnesiac.

00:12:04.105 --> 00:12:07.893
We ask these amnesiac patients
to tell us which one they own,

00:12:07.917 --> 00:12:11.315
which one they chose last time,
which one is theirs.

00:12:11.339 --> 00:12:14.545
And what we find is,
amnesiac patients just guess.

00:12:14.569 --> 00:12:17.245
These are normal controls,
where if I did this with you,

00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:19.378
all of you would know
which print you chose.

00:12:19.402 --> 00:12:23.007
But if I do this with amnesiac patients,
they don't have a clue.

00:12:23.031 --> 00:12:25.608
They can't pick their print
out of a lineup.

00:12:26.825 --> 00:12:31.280
Here's what normal controls do:
they synthesize happiness. Right?

00:12:31.304 --> 00:12:33.111
This is the change in liking score,

00:12:33.135 --> 00:12:36.648
the change from the first time they ranked
to the second time they ranked.

00:12:36.672 --> 00:12:39.352
Normal controls show --
that was the magic I showed you;

00:12:39.376 --> 00:12:41.620
now I'm showing it to you
in graphical form --

00:12:41.644 --> 00:12:43.553
"The one I own is better than I thought.

00:12:43.577 --> 00:12:46.069
The one I didn't own,
the one I left behind,

00:12:46.093 --> 00:12:47.903
is not as good as I thought."

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:53.003
Amnesiacs do exactly the same thing.
Think about this result.

00:12:53.027 --> 00:12:55.948
These people like better the one they own,

00:12:55.972 --> 00:12:58.217
but they don't know they own it.

00:12:59.526 --> 00:13:03.296
"Yeah, right" is not the right response!

00:13:03.885 --> 00:13:07.140
What these people did
when they synthesized happiness

00:13:07.164 --> 00:13:09.726
is they really, truly changed

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:14.483
their affective, hedonic, aesthetic
reactions to that poster.

00:13:15.003 --> 00:13:17.392
They're not just saying it
because they own it,

00:13:17.416 --> 00:13:19.951
because they don't know they own it.

00:13:20.753 --> 00:13:23.315
When psychologists show you bars,

00:13:23.339 --> 00:13:26.894
you know that they are showing
you averages of lots of people.

00:13:26.918 --> 00:13:30.227
And yet, all of us have
this psychological immune system,

00:13:30.251 --> 00:13:32.725
this capacity to synthesize happiness,

00:13:32.749 --> 00:13:35.900
but some of us do this trick
better than others.

00:13:35.924 --> 00:13:39.957
And some situations allow anybody
to do it more effectively

00:13:39.981 --> 00:13:41.741
than other situations do.

00:13:43.321 --> 00:13:46.566
It turns out that freedom,

00:13:46.590 --> 00:13:49.916
the ability to make up your mind
and change your mind,

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:52.093
is the friend of natural happiness,

00:13:52.117 --> 00:13:55.828
because it allows you to choose
among all those delicious futures

00:13:55.852 --> 00:13:58.202
and find the one
that you would most enjoy.

00:13:58.226 --> 00:13:59.978
But freedom to choose,

00:14:00.002 --> 00:14:01.759
to change and make up your mind,

00:14:01.783 --> 00:14:04.580
is the enemy of synthetic happiness,

00:14:04.604 --> 00:14:06.051
and I'm going to show you why.

00:14:06.075 --> 00:14:07.775
Dilbert already knows, of course.

00:14:07.799 --> 00:14:09.981
"Dogbert's tech support.
How may I abuse you?"

00:14:10.005 --> 00:14:12.619
"My printer prints a blank page
after every document."

00:14:12.643 --> 00:14:14.619
"Why complain about getting free paper?"

00:14:14.643 --> 00:14:16.919
"Free? Aren't you just
giving me my own paper?"

00:14:16.943 --> 00:14:20.619
"Look at the quality of the free paper
compared to your lousy regular paper!

00:14:20.643 --> 00:14:23.419
Only a fool or a liar would say
that they look the same!"

00:14:23.443 --> 00:14:26.205
"Now that you mention it,
it does seem a little silkier!"

00:14:26.229 --> 00:14:27.405
"What are you doing?"

00:14:27.429 --> 00:14:31.256
"I'm helping people accept the things
they cannot change." Indeed.

00:14:31.835 --> 00:14:34.279
The psychological immune system works best

00:14:34.303 --> 00:14:37.320
when we are totally stuck,
when we are trapped.

00:14:37.344 --> 00:14:39.863
This is the difference
between dating and marriage.

00:14:39.887 --> 00:14:41.442
You go out on a date with a guy,

00:14:41.466 --> 00:14:44.110
and he picks his nose;
you don't go out on another date.

00:14:44.134 --> 00:14:46.298
You're married to a guy
and he picks his nose?

00:14:46.322 --> 00:14:48.975
He has a heart of gold.
Don't touch the fruitcake!

00:14:48.999 --> 00:14:52.420
You find a way to be happy
with what's happened.

00:14:52.444 --> 00:14:53.445
(Laughter)

00:14:53.469 --> 00:14:54.858
Now, what I want to show you

00:14:54.882 --> 00:14:57.485
is that people don't know
this about themselves,

00:14:57.509 --> 00:15:01.787
and not knowing this can work
to our supreme disadvantage.

00:15:01.811 --> 00:15:03.788
Here's an experiment we did at Harvard.

00:15:03.812 --> 00:15:06.840
We created a black-and-white
photography course,

00:15:06.864 --> 00:15:10.441
and we allowed students to come in
and learn how to use a darkroom.

00:15:10.465 --> 00:15:12.808
So we gave them cameras,
they went around campus,

00:15:12.832 --> 00:15:15.193
they took 12 pictures
of their favorite professors

00:15:15.217 --> 00:15:17.272
and their dorm room and their dog,

00:15:17.296 --> 00:15:20.414
and all the other things they wanted
to have Harvard memories of.

00:15:20.438 --> 00:15:22.964
They bring us the camera,
we make up a contact sheet,

00:15:22.988 --> 00:15:25.283
they figure out which are
the two best pictures.

00:15:25.307 --> 00:15:27.818
We now spend six hours
teaching them about darkrooms,

00:15:27.842 --> 00:15:29.266
and they blow two of them up.

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:31.156
They have two gorgeous 8 x 10 glossies

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:33.201
of meaningful things to them, and we say,

00:15:33.225 --> 00:15:35.596
"Which one would you like to give up?"

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:36.771
"I have to give one up?"

00:15:36.795 --> 00:15:39.907
"Yes, we need one as evidence
of the class project.

00:15:39.931 --> 00:15:42.549
So you have to give me one.
You have to make a choice.

00:15:42.573 --> 00:15:45.319
You get to keep one,
and I get to keep one."

00:15:45.343 --> 00:15:48.319
Now, there are two conditions
in this experiment.

00:15:48.343 --> 00:15:50.621
In one case, the students are told,

00:15:50.645 --> 00:15:53.001
"But you know,
if you want to change your mind,

00:15:53.025 --> 00:15:54.878
I'll always have the other one here,

00:15:54.902 --> 00:15:59.377
and in the next four days, before
I actually mail it to headquarters" --

00:15:59.401 --> 00:16:01.334
yeah, "headquarters" --

00:16:01.358 --> 00:16:02.363
(Laughter)

00:16:02.387 --> 00:16:04.236
"I'll be glad to swap it out with you.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.313
In fact, I'll come to your dorm room,
just give me an email.

00:16:07.337 --> 00:16:09.328
Better yet, I'll check with you.

00:16:09.352 --> 00:16:12.240
You ever want to change your mind,
it's totally returnable."

00:16:12.264 --> 00:16:15.161
The other half of the students
are told exactly the opposite:

00:16:15.185 --> 00:16:16.915
"Make your choice, and by the way,

00:16:16.939 --> 00:16:19.829
the mail is going out, gosh,
in two minutes, to England.

00:16:19.853 --> 00:16:22.498
Your picture will be winging
its way over the Atlantic.

00:16:22.522 --> 00:16:24.269
You will never see it again."

00:16:24.881 --> 00:16:27.138
Half of the students
in each of these conditions

00:16:27.162 --> 00:16:28.642
are asked to make predictions

00:16:28.666 --> 00:16:30.738
about how much
they're going to come to like

00:16:30.762 --> 00:16:32.114
the picture that they keep

00:16:32.138 --> 00:16:33.825
and the picture they leave behind.

00:16:33.849 --> 00:16:36.750
Other students are just sent back
to their little dorm rooms

00:16:36.774 --> 00:16:39.885
and they are measured
over the next three to six days

00:16:39.909 --> 00:16:41.907
on their satisfaction with the pictures.

00:16:41.931 --> 00:16:43.169
Look at what we find.

00:16:43.193 --> 00:16:46.548
First of all, here's what students
think is going to happen.

00:16:46.572 --> 00:16:50.465
They think they're going to maybe
come to like the picture they chose

00:16:50.489 --> 00:16:53.005
a little more
than the one they left behind.

00:16:53.029 --> 00:16:56.117
But these are not statistically
significant differences.

00:16:56.141 --> 00:16:59.657
It's a very small increase,
and it doesn't much matter

00:16:59.681 --> 00:17:02.649
whether they were in the reversible
or irreversible condition.

00:17:02.673 --> 00:17:03.833
Wrong-o.

00:17:03.857 --> 00:17:05.026
Bad simulators.

00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:06.948
Because here's what's really happening.

00:17:06.972 --> 00:17:10.306
Both right before the swap
and five days later,

00:17:10.330 --> 00:17:12.516
people who are stuck with that picture,

00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:13.692
who have no choice,

00:17:13.716 --> 00:17:15.756
who can never change their mind,

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:17.209
like it a lot.

00:17:17.934 --> 00:17:20.885
And people who are deliberating --
"Should I return it?

00:17:20.909 --> 00:17:22.292
Have I gotten the right one?

00:17:22.316 --> 00:17:25.215
Maybe this isn't the good one.
Maybe I left the good one?" --

00:17:25.239 --> 00:17:26.439
have killed themselves.

00:17:26.463 --> 00:17:27.921
They don't like their picture.

00:17:27.945 --> 00:17:30.602
In fact, even after the opportunity
to swap has expired,

00:17:30.626 --> 00:17:32.636
they still don't like their picture.

00:17:33.127 --> 00:17:34.278
Why?

00:17:34.302 --> 00:17:37.610
Because the [reversible] condition
is not conducive

00:17:37.634 --> 00:17:39.455
to the synthesis of happiness.

00:17:40.218 --> 00:17:43.121
So here's the final piece
of this experiment.

00:17:43.145 --> 00:17:46.885
We bring in a whole new group
of naive Harvard students

00:17:46.909 --> 00:17:50.265
and we say, "You know,
we're doing a photography course,

00:17:50.289 --> 00:17:52.040
and we can do it one of two ways.

00:17:52.607 --> 00:17:55.240
We could do it so that when
you take the two pictures,

00:17:55.264 --> 00:17:57.285
you'd have four days to change your mind,

00:17:57.309 --> 00:18:00.198
or we're doing another course
where you take the two pictures

00:18:00.222 --> 00:18:03.287
and you make up your mind right away
and you can never change it.

00:18:03.311 --> 00:18:05.335
Which course would you like
to be in?" Duh!

00:18:05.359 --> 00:18:07.777
Sixty-six percent
of the students, two-thirds,

00:18:07.801 --> 00:18:11.870
prefer to be in the course where they have
the opportunity to change their mind.

00:18:11.894 --> 00:18:15.456
Hello? Sixty-six percent of the students
choose to be in the course

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:19.144
in which they will ultimately be deeply
dissatisfied with the picture --

00:18:19.168 --> 00:18:20.184
(Laughter)

00:18:20.208 --> 00:18:26.109
because they do not know the conditions
under which synthetic happiness grows.

00:18:26.747 --> 00:18:31.751
The Bard said everything best,
of course, and he's making my point here

00:18:31.775 --> 00:18:33.751
but he's making it hyperbolically:

00:18:33.775 --> 00:18:37.035
"'Tis nothing good or bad
But thinking makes it so."

00:18:37.059 --> 00:18:40.281
It's nice poetry,
but that can't exactly be right.

00:18:40.305 --> 00:18:42.393
Is there really nothing good or bad?

00:18:42.417 --> 00:18:46.332
Is it really the case that gall bladder
surgery and a trip to Paris

00:18:46.356 --> 00:18:47.893
are just the same thing?

00:18:47.917 --> 00:18:49.004
(Laughter)

00:18:49.028 --> 00:18:52.885
That seems like a one-question IQ test.

00:18:52.909 --> 00:18:54.781
They can't be exactly the same.

00:18:54.805 --> 00:18:57.885
In more turgid prose,
but closer to the truth,

00:18:57.909 --> 00:19:01.283
was the father of modern capitalism,
Adam Smith, and he said this.

00:19:01.307 --> 00:19:03.262
This is worth contemplating:

00:19:03.286 --> 00:19:07.238
"The great source of both the misery
and disorders of human life

00:19:07.262 --> 00:19:09.885
seems to arise from overrating
the difference

00:19:09.909 --> 00:19:12.885
between one permanent
situation and another.

00:19:12.909 --> 00:19:18.206
Some of these situations may, no doubt,
deserve to be preferred to others,

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:21.159
but none of them can deserve to be pursued

00:19:21.183 --> 00:19:25.753
with that passionate ardor
which drives us to violate the rules

00:19:25.777 --> 00:19:28.246
either of prudence or of justice,

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:31.035
or to corrupt the future
tranquility of our minds,

00:19:31.059 --> 00:19:34.596
either by shame from the remembrance
of our own folly,

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:38.692
or by remorse for the horror
of our own injustice."

00:19:38.716 --> 00:19:43.448
In other words: yes, some things
are better than others.

00:19:43.472 --> 00:19:48.975
We should have preferences that lead us
into one future over another.

00:19:48.999 --> 00:19:52.780
But when those preferences
drive us too hard and too fast

00:19:52.804 --> 00:19:56.495
because we have overrated
the difference between these futures,

00:19:56.519 --> 00:19:59.055
we are at risk.

00:19:59.079 --> 00:20:02.797
When our ambition is bounded,
it leads us to work joyfully.

00:20:02.821 --> 00:20:04.693
When our ambition is unbounded,

00:20:04.717 --> 00:20:09.131
it leads us to lie, to cheat,
to steal, to hurt others,

00:20:09.155 --> 00:20:11.154
to sacrifice things of real value.

00:20:11.178 --> 00:20:13.195
When our fears are bounded,

00:20:13.219 --> 00:20:15.354
we're prudent, we're cautious,

00:20:15.378 --> 00:20:16.561
we're thoughtful.

00:20:16.585 --> 00:20:19.848
When our fears
are unbounded and overblown,

00:20:19.872 --> 00:20:22.082
we're reckless, and we're cowardly.

00:20:22.625 --> 00:20:25.975
The lesson I want to leave
you with, from these data,

00:20:25.999 --> 00:20:30.078
is that our longings and our worries
are both to some degree overblown,

00:20:30.102 --> 00:20:36.274
because we have within us the capacity
to manufacture the very commodity

00:20:36.298 --> 00:20:40.717
we are constantly chasing
when we choose experience.

00:20:40.741 --> 00:20:41.892
Thank you.

00:20:41.916 --> 00:20:46.841
(Applause)
