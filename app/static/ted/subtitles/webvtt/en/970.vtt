00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Welcome to Thailand.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Now, when I was a young man -- 40 years ago,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
the country was very, very poor

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
with lots and lots and lots of people living in poverty.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We decided to do something about it,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
but we didn't begin with a welfare program

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
or a poverty reduction program.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
But we began with a family-planning program,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
following a very successful

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
maternal child health activity,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
sets of activities.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So basically, no one would accept family planning

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
if their children didn't survive.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So the first step: get to the children, get to the mothers,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and then follow up with family planning.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Not just child mortality alone, you need also family planning.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Now let me take you back

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
as to why we needed to do it.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
In my country, that was the case in 1974.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Seven children per family --

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
tremendous growth at 3.3 percent.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
There was just no future.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
We needed to reduce the population growth rate.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So we said, "Let's do it."

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
The women said, "We agree. We'll use pills,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
but we need a doctor to prescribe the pills,"

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and we had very, very few doctors.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
We didn't take no as an answer;

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
we took no as a question.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
We went to the nurses and the midwives, who were also women,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and did a fantastic job

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
at explaining how to use the pill.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
That was wonderful,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
but it covered only 20 percent of the country.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
What do we do for the other 80 percent --

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
leave them alone and say, "Well, they're not medical personnel."

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
No, we decided to do a bit more.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
So we went to the ordinary people that you saw.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Actually, below that yellow sign --

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I wish they hadn't wiped that,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
because there was "Coca-Cola" there.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
We were so much bigger than Coca-Cola in those days.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And no difference,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
the people they chose were the people we chose.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
They were well-known in the community,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
they knew that customers were always right,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and they were terrific, and they practiced their family planning themselves.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
So they could supply pills and condoms

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
throughout the country, in every village of the country.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
So there we are. We went to the people

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
who were seen as the cause of the problem

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
to be the solution.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Wherever there were people --

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
and you can see boats with the women, selling things --

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
here's the floating market

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
selling bananas and crabs

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and also contraceptives --

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
wherever you find people,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
you'll find contraceptives in Thailand.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And then we decided, why not get to religion

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
because in the Philippines,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
the Catholic Church was pretty strong,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and Thai people were Buddhist.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
We went to them and they said, "Look, could you help us?"

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I'm there -- the one in blue, not the yellow --

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
holding a bowl of holy water

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
for the monk to sprinkle holy water

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
on pills and condoms

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
for the sanctity of the family.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And this picture was sent throughout the country.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
So some of the monks in the villages were doing the same thing themselves.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And the women were saying, "No wonder we have no side-effects.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
It's been blessed."

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
That was their perception.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And then we went to teachers.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
You need everybody to be involved

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
in trying to provide whatever it is

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
that make humanity a better place.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
So we went to the teachers.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Over a quarter of a million were taught about family planning

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
with a new alphabet -- A, B for birth, C for condom,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
I for IUD, V for vasectomy.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
And then we had a snakes and ladders game, where you throw dice.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
If you land on anything pro-family planning, you move ahead.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Like, "Mother takes the pill every night.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Very good, mother. Move ahead.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Uncle buys a condom. Very good, uncle. Move ahead.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Uncle gets drunk, doesn't use condom. Come back, start again."

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
(Laughter)

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Again, education, class entertainment.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And the kids were doing it in school too.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
We had relay races with condoms,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
we had children's condom-blowing championship.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And before long,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
the condom was know as the girl's best friend.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
In Thailand, for poor people, diamonds don't make it --

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
so the condom is the girl's best friend.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
We introduced our first microcredit program in 1975,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and the women who organized it said,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
"We only want to lend

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
to women who practice family planning.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
If you're pregnant, take care of your pregnancy.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
If you're not pregnant, you can take a loan out from us."

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
And that was run by them.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
And after 35/36 years,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
it's still going on.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
It's a part of the Village Development Bank;

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
it's not a real bank, but it's a fund -- microcredit.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And we didn't need a big organization to run it --

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
it was run by the villagers themselves.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
And you probably hardly see a Thai man there,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
it's always women, women, women, women.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
And then we thought we'd help America,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
because America's been helping everyone,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
whether they want help or not.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000
(Laughter)

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
And this is on the Fourth of July.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
We decided to provide vasectomy to all men,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
but in particular, American men to the front of the queue,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
right up to the Ambassador's residence

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
during his vin d'honneur.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
And the hotel gave us the ballroom for it --

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
very appropriate room.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
(Laughter)

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
And since it was near lunch time,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
they said, "All right, we'll give you some lunch.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Of course, it must be American cola.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
You get two brands, Coke and Pepsi.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
And then the food is either hamburger or hotdog."

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And I thought a hotdog will be more symbolic.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
(Laughter)

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
And here is this, then, young man called Willy Bohm

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
who worked for the USAID.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Obviously, he's had his vasectomy

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
because his hotdog is half eaten, and he was very happy.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
It made a lot of news in America, and it angered some people also.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
I said, "Don't worry. Come over and I'll do the whole lot of you."

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
(Laughter)

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And what happened?

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
In all this thing,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
from seven children to 1.5 children,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
population growth rate of 3.3 to 0.5.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
You could call it the Coca-Cola approach if you like --

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
it was exactly the same thing.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
I'm not sure whether Coca-Cola followed us, or we followed Coca-Cola,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
but we're good friends.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And so that's the case of everyone joining in.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
We didn't have a strong government. We didn't have lots of doctors.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
But it's everybody's job

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
who can change attitude and behavior.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Then AIDS came along and hit Thailand,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
and we had to stop doing a lot of good things

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
to fight AIDS.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
But unfortunately, the government was in denial, denial, denial.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
So our work wasn't affected.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
So I thought, "Well, if you can't go to the government, go to the military."

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
So I went to the military

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
and asked to borrow 300 radio stations.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
They have more than the government,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
and they've got more guns than the government.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
So I asked them, could they help us

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
in our fight against HIV.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
And after I gave them statistics,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
they said, "Yes. Okay. You can use all the radio stations, television stations."

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
And that's when we went onto the airwaves.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
And then we got a new prime minister soon after that.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And he said, "Mechai, could you come and join?"

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
He asked me in because he liked my wife a lot.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
So I said, "Okay."

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
He became the chairman of the National AIDS Committee

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
and increased the budget fifty-fold.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Every ministry, even judges, had to be involved in AIDS education --

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
everyone -- and we said the public, institutions,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
religious institutions, schools --

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
everyone was involved.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
And here, every media person

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
had to be trained for HIV.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And we gave every station half a minute extra

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
for advertising to earn more money.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
So they were happy with that.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
And then AIDS education in all schools,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
starting from university.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
And these are high school kids teaching high school kids.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
And the best teachers were the girls, not the boys,

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
and they were terrific.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
And these girls who go around teaching about safe sex and HIV

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
were known as Mother Theresa.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
And then we went down one more step.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
These are primary school kids -- third, fourth grade --

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
going to every household in the village,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
every household in the whole of Thailand,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
giving AIDS information and a condom

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
to every household,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
given by these young kids.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
And no parents objected, because we were trying to save lives,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
and this was a lifesaver.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
And we said, "Everyone needs to be involved."

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
So you have the companies also realizing

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
that sick staff don't work, and dead customers don't buy.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
So they all trained.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
And then we have this Captain Condom,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
with his Harvard MBA,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
going to schools and night spots.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
And they loved him. You need a symbol of something.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
In every country, every program, you need a symbol,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
and this is probably the best thing he's ever done with his MBA.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
(Laughter)

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
And then we gave condoms out everywhere on the streets --

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
everywhere, everywhere.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
In taxis, you get condoms.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
And also, in traffic,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
the policemen give you condoms -- our "cops and rubbers" programs.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
(Laughter)

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
So, can you imagine New York policemen giving out condoms?

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Of course I can. And they'd enjoy it immensely;

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
I see them standing around right now, everywhere.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Imagine if they had condoms,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
giving out to all sorts of people.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
And then, new change,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
we had hair bands, clothing

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
and the condom for your mobile phone

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
during the rainy season.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
(Laughter)

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
And these were the condoms that we introduced.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
One says, "Weapon of mass protection."

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
We found --

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
you know -- somebody here was searching for the weapon of mass destruction,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
but we have found the weapon of mass protection: the condom.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
And then it says here, with the American flag,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
"Don't leave home without it."

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
But I have some to give out afterward.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
But let me warn you, these are Thai-sized,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
so be very careful.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
(Laughter)

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
And so you can see

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
that condoms can do so many things.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Look at this --

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
I gave this to Al Gore and to Bill Senior also.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Stop global warming; use condoms.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
And then this is the picture I mentioned to you --

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
the weapon of mass protection.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
And let the next Olympics save some lives.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Why just run around?

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
(Laughter)

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
And then finally,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
in Thailand we're Buddhist, we don't have a God,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
so instead, we say, "In rubber we trust."

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
(Laughter)

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
So you can see that we added everything to our endeavor

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
to make life better for the people.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
We had condoms in all the refrigerators in the hotels and the schools,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
because alcohol impairs judgment.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
And then what happened?

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
After all this time, everybody joined in.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000
According to the U.N.,

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
new cases of HIV

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
declined by 90 percent,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
and according to the World Bank,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
7.7 million lives were saved.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Otherwise there wouldn't be many Thais walking around today.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
So it just showed you, you could do something about it.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
90 percent of the funding came from Thailand.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
There was political commitment, some financial commitment,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
and everybody joined in the fight.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
So just don't leave it to the specialists and doctors and nurses.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
We all need to help.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
And then we decided to help people out of poverty,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
now that we got AIDS somewhat out of the way --

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
this time, not with government alone,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
but in cooperation with the business community.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Because poor people are business people

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
who lack business skills and access to credit.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Those are the things to be provided by the business community.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
We're trying to turn them into barefoot entrepreneurs,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
little business people.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
The only way out of poverty is through business enterprise.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
So, that was done.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
The money goes from the company into the village

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
via tree-planting.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
It's not a free gift.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
They plant the trees, and the money goes into their microcredit fund,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
which we call the Village Development Bank.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Everybody joins in,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
and they feel they own the bank,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
because they have brought the money in.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
And before you can borrow the money, you need to be trained.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
And we believe if you want to help the poor,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
those who are living in poverty,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
access to credit must be a human right.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Access to credit must be a human right.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Otherwise they'll never get out of poverty.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
And then before getting a loan, you must be trained.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Here's what we call a "barefoot MBA,"

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
teaching people how to do business

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
so that, when they borrow money, they'll succeed with the business.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
These are some of the businesses:

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
mushrooms, crabs, vegetables,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
trees, fruits,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
and this is very interesting -- Nike ice cream and Nike biscuits;

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
this is a village sponsored by Nike.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
They said, "They should stop making shoes and clothes.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Make these better, because we can afford them."

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
And then we have silk, Thai silk.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Now we're making Scottish tartans, as you can see on the left,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
to sell to all people of Scottish ancestors.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
So anyone sitting in and watching TV,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
get in touch with me.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
And then this is our answer to Starbucks in Thailand --

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
"Coffee and Condoms."

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
See, Starbucks you awake, we keep you awake and alive.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
That's the difference.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Can you imagine, at every Starbucks

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
that you can also get condoms?

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
You can order your condoms with your with your cappuccino.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
And then now, finally in education,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
we want to change the school as being underutilized

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
into a place where it's a lifelong learning center for everyone.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
We call this our School-Based Integrated Rural Development.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
And it's a center, a focal point

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
for economic and social development.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Re-do the school,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
make it serve the community needs.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
And here is a bamboo building --

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
all of them are bamboo.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
This is a geodesic dome made of bamboo.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
And I'm sure Buckminster Fuller would be very, very proud

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
to see a bamboo geodesic dome.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
And we use vegetables around the school ground,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
so they raise their own vegetables.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
And then, finally, I firmly believe,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
if we want the MDGs to work --

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
the Millennium Development Goals --

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
we need to add family planning to it.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
Of course, child mortality first and then family planning --

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
everyone needs family planning service --

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
it's underutilized.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
So we have now found the weapon of mass protection.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
And we also ask the next Olympics

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
to be involved in saving lives.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
And then, finally, that is our network.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
And these are our Thai tulips.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
(Laughter)

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Thank you very much indeed.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
(Applause)
