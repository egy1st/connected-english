WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So, I'd like to spend a few minutes with you folks today

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
imagining what our planet might look like in a thousand years.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
But before I do that,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I need to talk to you about synthetic materials like plastics,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
which require huge amounts of energy to create

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and, because of their disposal issues,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
are slowly poisoning our planet.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I also want to tell you and share with you

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
how my team and I

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
have been using mushrooms over the last three years.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Not like that. (Laughter)

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
We're using mushrooms to create an entirely new class of materials,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
which perform a lot like plastics during their use,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
but are made from crop waste

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and are totally compostable at the end of their lives.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
(Cheering)

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
But first,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I need to talk to you about what I consider one of the most egregious offenders

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
in the disposable plastics category.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
This is a material you all know is Styrofoam,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
but I like to think of it as toxic white stuff.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
In a single cubic foot of this material --

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
about what would come around your computer or large television --

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
you have the same energy content

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
of about a liter and a half of petrol.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Yet, after just a few weeks of use,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
you'll throw this material in the trash.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And this isn't just found in packaging.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
20 billion dollars of this material is produced every year,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
in everything from building materials to surfboards

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
to coffee cups to table tops.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
And that's not the only place it's found.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
The EPA estimates, in the United States,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
by volume, this material occupies 25 percent of our landfills.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Even worse is when it finds its way into our natural environment --

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
on the side of the road or next to a river.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
If it's not picked up by a human, like me and you,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
it'll stay there for thousands and thousands of years.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Perhaps even worse

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
is when it finds its way into our oceans, like in the great plastic gyre,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
where these materials are being mechanically broken

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
into smaller and smaller bits,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
but they're not really going away.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
They're not biologically compatible.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
They're basically fouling up

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Earth's respiratory and circulatory systems.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And because these materials are so prolific,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
because they're found in so many places,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
there's one other place you'll find this material, styrene,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
which is made from benzene, a known carcinogen.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
You'll find it inside of you.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
So, for all these reasons,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I think we need better materials,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and there are three key principles we can use to guide these materials.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
The first is feedstocks.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Today, we use a single feedstock, petroleum,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
to heat our homes, power our cars

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
and make most of the materials you see around you.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
We recognize this is a finite resource,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
and it's simply crazy to do this, to put a liter and a half of petrol in the trash

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
every time you get a package.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Second of all, we should really strive to use far less energy

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
in creating these materials.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
I say far less, because 10 percent isn't going to cut it.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
We should be talking about half, a quarter,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
one-tenth the energy content.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And lastly, and I think perhaps most importantly,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
we should be creating materials

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
that fit into what I call nature's recycling system.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
This recycling system has been in place for the last billion years.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I fit into it, you fit into it,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and a hundred years tops, my body can return to the Earth with no preprocessing.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Yet that packaging I got in the mail yesterday

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
is going to last for thousands of years.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
This is crazy.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
But nature provides us with a really good model here.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
When a tree's done using its leaves --

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
its solar collectors, these amazing molecular photon capturing devices --

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
at the end of a season,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
it doesn't pack them up, take them to the leaf reprocessing center

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
and have them melted down to form new leaves.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
It just drops them, the shortest distance possible,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
to the forest floor,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
where they're actually upcycled into next year's topsoil.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And this gets us back to the mushrooms.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Because in nature,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
mushrooms are the recycling system.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And what we've discovered

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
is, by using a part of the mushroom you've probably never seen --

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
analogous to its root structure; it's called mycelium --

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
we can actually grow materials

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
with many of the same properties of conventional synthetics.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Now, mycelium is an amazing material,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
because it's a self-assembling material.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
It actually takes things we would consider waste --

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
things like seed husks or woody biomass --

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
and can transform them into a chitinous polymer,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
which you can form into almost any shape.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
In our process,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
we basically use it as a glue.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And by using mycelium as a glue,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
you can mold things just like you do in the plastic industry,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
and you can create materials with many different properties,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
materials that are insulating, fire-resistant,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
moisture-resistant, vapor-resistant --

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
materials that can absorb impacts, that can absorb acoustical impacts.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
But these materials are grown from agricultural byproducts,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
not petroleum.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And because they're made of natural materials,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
they are 100 percent compostable

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
in you own backyard.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
So I'd like to share with you the four basic steps

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
required to make these materials.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
The first is selecting a feedstock,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
preferably something that's regional, that's in your area, right --

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
local manufacturing.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
The next is actually taking this feedstock and putting in a tool,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
physically filling an enclosure, a mold,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
in whatever shape you want to get.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Then you actually grow the mycelium through these particles,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
and that's where the magic happens,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
because the organism is doing the work in this process,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
not the equipment.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
The final step is, of course, the product,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
whether it's a packaging material, a table top, or building block.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Our vision is local manufacturing,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
like the local food movement, for production.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
So we've created formulations for all around the world

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
using regional byproducts.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
If you're in China, you might use a rice husk

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
or a cottonseed hull.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
If you're in Northern Europe or North America,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
you can use things like buckwheat husks or oat hulls.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
We then process these husks with some basic equipment.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
And I want to share with you a quick video from our facility

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
that gives you a sense of how this looks at scale.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
So what you're seeing here is actually cotton hulls from Texas, in this case.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
It's a waste product.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
And what they're doing in our equipment

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
is going through a continuous system,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
which cleans, cooks, cools

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
and pasteurizes these materials,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
while also continuously inoculating them with our mycelium.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
This gives us a continuous stream of material

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
that we can put into almost any shape,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
though today we're making corner blocks.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
And it's when this lid goes on the part,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
that the magic really starts.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Because the manufacturing process is our organism.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
It'll actually begin to digest these wastes

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
and, over the next five days,

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
assemble them into biocomposites.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Our entire facility

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
is comprised of thousands and thousands and thousands of these tools

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
sitting indoors in the dark, quietly self-assembling materials --

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
and everything from building materials

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
to, in this case,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
a packaging corner block.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
So I've said a number of times that we grow materials.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
And it's kind of hard to picture how that happens.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
So my team has taken five days-worth of growth,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
a typical growth cycle for us,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
and condensed it into a 15-second time lapse.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
And I want you to really watch closely

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
these little white dots on the screen,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
because, over the five-day period,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
what they do is extend out and through this material,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
using the energy that's contained in these seed husks

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
to build this chitinous polymer matrix.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
This matrix self-assembles,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
growing through and around the particles,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
making millions and millions of tiny fibers.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
And what parts of the seed husk we don't digest,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
actually become part of the final, physical composite.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
So in front of your eyes, this part just self-assembled.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
It actually takes a little longer. It takes five days.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
But it's much faster than conventional farming.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
The last step, of course, is application.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
In this case, we've grown a corner block.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
A major Fortune 500 furniture maker

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
uses these corner blocks to protect their tables in shipment.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
They used to use a plastic packaging buffer,

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
but we were able to give them the exact same physical performance

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
with our grown material.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Best of all, when it gets to the customer,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
it's not trash.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
They can actually put this in their natural ecosystem without any processing,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
and it's going to improve the local soil.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
So, why mycelium?

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
The first reason is local open feedstocks.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
You want to be able to do this anywhere in the world

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
and not worry about peak rice hull or peak cottonseed hulls,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
because you have multiple choices.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
The next is self-assembly,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
because the organism is actually doing most of the work in this process.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
You don't need a lot of equipment to set up a production facility.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
So you can have lots of small facilities

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
spread all across the world.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Biological yield is really important.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
And because 100 percent of what we put in the tool become the final product,

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
even the parts that aren't digested

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
become part of the structure,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
we're getting incredible yield rates.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Natural polymers, well ... I think that's what's most important,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
because these polymers have been tried and tested

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
in our ecosystem for the last billion years,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
in everything from mushrooms to crustaceans.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
They're not going to clog up Earth's ecosystems. They work great.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And while, today,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
we can practically guarantee that yesterday's packaging

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
is going to be here in 10,000 years,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
what I want to guarantee

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
is that in 10,000 years,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
our descendants, our children's children,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
will be living happily and in harmony

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
with a healthy Earth.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
And I think that can be some really good news.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Thank you.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
(Applause)
