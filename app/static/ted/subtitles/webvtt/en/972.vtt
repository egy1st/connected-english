00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I want to talk to you today about prosperity,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
about our hopes

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
for a shared and lasting prosperity.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And not just us,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
but the two billion people worldwide

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
who are still chronically undernourished.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And hope actually is at the heart of this.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
In fact, the Latin word for hope

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
is at the heart of the word prosperity.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
"Pro-speras," "speras," hope --

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
in accordance with our hopes and expectations.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The irony is, though,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
that we have cashed-out prosperity

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
almost literally in terms of money and economic growth.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And we've grown our economies so much

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
that we now stand

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
in a real danger

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
of undermining hope --

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
running down resources, cutting down rainforests,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
spilling oil into the Gulf of Mexico,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
changing the climate --

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and the only thing that has actually

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
remotely slowed down the relentless rise

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
of carbon emissions over the last two to three decades

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
is recession.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
And recession, of course,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
isn't exactly a recipe for hope either,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
as we're busy finding out.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
So we're caught in a kind of trap.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
It's a dilemma, a dilemma of growth.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
We can't live with it; we can't live without it.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Trash the system or crash the planet --

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
it's a tough choice; it isn't much of a choice.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And our best avenue of escape from this actually

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
is a kind of blind faith

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
in our own cleverness and technology and efficiency

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and doing things more efficiently.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Now I haven't got anything against efficiency.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And I think we are a clever species sometimes.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
But I think we should also just check the numbers,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
take a reality check here.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
So I want you to imagine a world,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
in 2050, of around nine billion people,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
all aspiring to Western incomes,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Western lifestyles.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And I want to ask the question --

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
and we'll give them that two percent hike in income, in salary each year as well,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
because we believe in growth.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And I want to ask the question:

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
how far and how fast would be have to move?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
How clever would we have to be?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
How much technology would we need in this world

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
to deliver our carbon targets?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And here in my chart --

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
on the left-hand side is where we are now.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
This is the carbon intensity of economic growth

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
in the economy at the moment.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
It's around about 770 grams of carbon.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
In the world I describe to you,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
we have to be right over here at the right-hand side

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
at six grams of carbon.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
It's a 130-fold improvement,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and that is 10 times further and faster

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
than anything we've ever achieved in industrial history.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Maybe we can do it, maybe it's possible -- who knows?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Maybe we can even go further

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and get an economy that pulls carbon out of the atmosphere,

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
which is what we're going to need to be doing

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
by the end of the century.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
But shouldn't we just check first

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
that the economic system that we have

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
is remotely capable of delivering

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
this kind of improvement?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
So I want to just spend a couple of minutes on system dynamics.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
It's a bit complex, and I apologize for that.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
What I'll try and do, is I'll try and paraphrase it

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
is sort of human terms.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
So it looks a little bit like this.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Firms produce goods for households -- that's us --

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
and provide us with incomes,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and that's even better, because we can spend those incomes

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
on more goods and services.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
That's called the circular flow of the economy.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
It looks harmless enough.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
I just want to highlight one key feature of this system,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
which is the role of investment.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Now investment constitutes

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
only about a fifth of the national income

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
in most modern economies,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
but it plays an absolutely vital role.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And what it does essentially

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
is to stimulate further consumption growth.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
It does this in a couple of ways --

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
chasing productivity,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
which drives down prices and encourages us to buy more stuff.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
But I want to concentrate

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
on the role of investment

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
in seeking out novelty,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
the production and consumption of novelty.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Joseph Schumpeter called this

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
"the process of creative destruction."

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
It's a process of the production and reproduction of novelty,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
continually chasing expanding consumer markets,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
consumer goods, new consumer goods.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And this, this is where it gets interesting,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
because it turns out that human beings

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
have something of an appetite for novelty.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
We love new stuff --

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
new material stuff for sure --

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
but also new ideas, new adventures,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
new experiences.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
But the materiality matters too,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
because in every society

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
that anthropologists have looked at,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
material stuff

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
operates as a kind of language --

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
a language of goods,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
a symbolic language

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
that we use to tell each other stories --

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
stories, for example,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
about how important we are.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Status-driven, conspicuous consumption

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
thrives from the language

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
of novelty.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And here, all of a sudden,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
we have a system

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
that is locking economic structure with social logic --

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
the economic institutions, and who we are as people, locked together

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
to drive an engine of growth.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
And this engine is not just economic value;

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
it is pulling material resources

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
relentlessly through the system,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
driven by our own insatiable appetites,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
driven in fact by a sense of anxiety.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Adam Smith, 200 years ago,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
spoke about our desire

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
for a life without shame.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
A life without shame:

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
in his day, what that meant was a linen shirt,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
and today, well, you still need the shirt,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
but you need the hybrid car,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
the HDTV, two holidays a year in the sun,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
the netbook and iPad, the list goes on --

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
an almost inexhaustible supply of goods,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
driven by this anxiety.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
And even if we don't want them,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
we need to buy them,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
because, if we don't buy them, the system crashes.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
And to stop it crashing

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
over the last two to three decades,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
we've expanded the money supply,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
expanded credit and debt,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
so that people can keep buying stuff.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And of course, that expansion was deeply implicated in the crisis.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
But this -- I just want to show you some data here.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
This is what it looks like, essentially,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
this credit and debt system, just for the U.K.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
This was the last 15 years before the crash,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
and you can see there, consumer debt rose dramatically.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
It was above the GDP for three years in a row

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
just before the crisis.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
And in the mean time, personal savings absolutely plummeted.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
The savings ratio, net savings,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
were below zero in the middle of 2008,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
just before the crash.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
This is people expanding debt, drawing down their savings,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
just to stay in the game.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
This is a strange, rather perverse, story,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
just to put it in very simple terms.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
It's a story about us, people,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
being persuaded

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
to spend money we don't have

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
on things we don't need

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
to create impressions that won't last

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
on people we don't care about.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
(Laughter)

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
(Applause)

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
But before we consign ourselves to despair,

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
maybe we should just go back and say, "Did we get this right?

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Is this really how people are?

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Is this really how economies behave?"

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
And almost straightaway

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
we actually run up against a couple of anomalies.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
The first one is in the crisis itself.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
In the crisis, in the recession, what do people want to do?

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
They want to hunker down, they want to look to the future.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
They want to spend less and save more.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
But saving is exactly the wrong thing to do

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
from the system point of view.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Keynes called this the "paradox of thrift" --

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
saving slows down recovery.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
And politicians call on us continually

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
to draw down more debt,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
to draw down our own savings even further,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
just so that we can get the show back on the road,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
so we can keep this growth-based economy going.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
It's an anomaly,

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
it's a place where the system actually is at odds

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
with who we are as people.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Here's another one -- completely different one:

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Why is it

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
that we don't do the blindingly obvious things we should do

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
to combat climate change,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
very, very simple things

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
like buying energy-efficient appliances,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
putting in efficient lights, turning the lights off occasionally,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
insulating our homes?

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
These things save carbon, they save energy,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
they save us money.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
So is it that, though they make perfect economic sense,

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
we don't do them?

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Well, I had my own personal insight into this

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
a few years ago.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
It was a Sunday evening, Sunday afternoon,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
and it was just after --

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
actually, to be honest, too long after --

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
we had moved into a new house.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
And I had finally got around to doing some draft stripping,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
installing insulation around the windows and doors

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
to keep out the drafts.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And my, then, five year-old daughter

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
was helping me in the way that five year-olds do.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
And we'd been doing this for a while,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
when she turned to me very solemnly and said,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
"Will this really keep out the giraffes?"

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
(Laughter)

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
"Here they are, the giraffes."

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
You can hear the five-year-old mind working.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
These ones, interestingly, are 400 miles north of here

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
outside Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Goodness knows what they make of the Lake District weather.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
But actually that childish misrepresentation

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
stuck with me,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
because it suddenly became clear to me

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
why we don't do the blindingly obvious things.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
We're too busy keeping out the giraffes --

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
putting the kids on the bus in the morning,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
getting ourselves to work on time,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
surviving email overload

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
and shop floor politics,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
foraging for groceries, throwing together meals,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
escaping for a couple of precious hours in the evening

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
into prime-time TV

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
or TED online,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
getting from one end of the day to the other,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
keeping out the giraffes.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
(Laughter)

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
What is the objective?

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
"What is the objective of the consumer?"

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Mary Douglas asked in an essay on poverty

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
written 35 years ago.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
"It is," she said,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
"to help create the social world

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
and find a credible place in it."

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000
That is a deeply humanizing

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
vision of our lives,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
and it's a completely different vision

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
than the one that lies at the heart

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
of this economic model.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
So who are we?

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Who are these people?

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Are we these novelty-seeking, hedonistic,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
selfish individuals?

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Or might we actually occasionally be

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
something like the selfless altruist

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
depicted in Rembrandt's lovely, lovely sketch here?

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Well psychology actually says

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
there is a tension --

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
a tension between self-regarding behaviors

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
and other regarding behaviors.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
And these tensions have deep evolutionary roots,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
so selfish behavior

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
is adaptive in certain circumstances --

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
fight or flight.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
But other regarding behaviors

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
are essential to our evolution

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
as social beings.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
And perhaps even more interesting from our point of view,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
another tension between novelty-seeking behaviors

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
and tradition or conservation.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Novelty is adaptive when things are changing

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
and you need to adapt yourself.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Tradition is essential to lay down the stability

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
to raise families and form cohesive social groups.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
So here, all of a sudden,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
we're looking at a map of the human heart.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
And it reveals to us, suddenly,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
the crux of the matter.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
What we've done is we've created economies.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
We've created systems,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
which systematically privilege, encourage,

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
one narrow quadrant

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
of the human soul

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
and left the others unregarded.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
And in the same token, the solution becomes clear,

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
because this isn't, therefore,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
about changing human nature.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
It isn't, in fact, about curtailing possibilities.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
It is about opening up.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
It is about allowing ourselves the freedom

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
to become fully human,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
recognizing the depth and the breadth

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
of the human psyche

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
and building institutions

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
to protect Rembrandt's fragile altruist within.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
What does all this mean for economics?

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
What would economies look like

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
if we took that vision of human nature

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
at their heart

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
and stretched them

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
along these orthogonal dimensions

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
of the human psyche?

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Well, it might look a little bit

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
like the 4,000 community-interest companies

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
that have sprung up in the U.K. over the last five years

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
and a similar rise in B corporations in the United States,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
enterprises

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
that have ecological and social goals

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
written into their constitution

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
at their heart --

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
companies, in fact, like this one, Ecosia.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
And I just want to, very quickly, show you this.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Ecosia is an Internet search engine.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Internet search engines work

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
by drawing revenues from sponsored links

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
that appear when you do a search.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
And Ecosia works in pretty much the same way.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
So we can do that here --

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
we can just put in a little search term.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
There you go, Oxford, that's where we are. See what comes up.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
The difference with Ecosia though

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
is that, in Ecosia's case,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
it draws the revenues in the same way,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
but it allocates

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
80 percent of those revenues

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
to a rainforest protection project in the Amazon.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
And we're going to do it.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
We're just going to click on Naturejobs.uk.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
In case anyone out there is looking for a job in a recession,

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
that's the page to go to.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
And what happened then was

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
the sponsor gave revenues to Ecosia,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
and Ecosia is giving 80 percent of those revenues

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
to a rainforest protection project.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
It's taking profits from one place

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
and allocating them

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
into the protection of ecological resources.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
It's a different kind of enterprise

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
for a new economy.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
It's a form, if you like,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
of ecological altruism --

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
perhaps something along those lines. Maybe it's that.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Whatever it is,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
whatever this new economy is,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
what we need the economy to do, in fact,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
is to put investment

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
back into the heart of the model,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
to re-conceive investment.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Only now, investment

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
isn't going to be

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
about the relentless and mindless

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
pursuit of consumption growth.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Investment has to be a different beast.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Investment has to be,

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
in the new economy,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
protecting and nurturing

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
the ecological assets on which our future depends.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
It has to be about transition.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
It has to be investing in low-carbon technologies

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
and infrastructures.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
We have to invest, in fact,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
in the idea of a meaningful prosperity,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
providing capabilities

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
for people to flourish.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
And of course, this task has material dimensions.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
It would be nonsense to talk about people flourishing

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
if they didn't have food, clothing and shelter.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
But it's also clear that prosperity goes beyond this.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000
It has social and psychological aims --

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
family, friendship,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
commitments, society,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
participating in the life of that society.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
And this too

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000
requires investment,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
investment -- for example, in places --

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
places where we can connect,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
places where we can participate,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
shared spaces,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
concert halls, gardens,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
public parks,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
libraries, museums, quiet centers,

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
places of joy and celebration,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
places of tranquility and contemplation,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
sites for the "cultivation

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
of a common citizenship,"

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
in Michael Sandel's lovely phrase.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
An investment -- investment, after all, is just such a basic economic concept --

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
is nothing more nor less

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
than a relationship

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
between the present and the future,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
a shared present and a common future.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
And we need that relationship to reflect,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
to reclaim hope.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
So let me come back, with this sense of hope,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
to the two billion people

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
still trying to live each day

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
on less than the price of a skinny latte

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
from the cafe next door.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
What can we offer those people?

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
It's clear that we have a responsibility

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
to help lift them out of poverty.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
It's clear that we have a responsibility

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
to make room for growth

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
where growth really matters in those poorest nations.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
And it's also clear that we will never achieve that

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
unless we're capable of redefining

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
a meaningful sense of prosperity in the richer nations,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
a prosperity that is more meaningful

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
and less materialistic

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
than the growth-based model.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
So this is not just

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
a Western post-materialist fantasy.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
In fact, an African philosopher wrote to me,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
when "Prosperity Without Growth" was published,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
pointing out the similarities

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
between this view of prosperity

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
and the traditional African concept of ubuntu.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Ubuntu says, "I am

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
because we are."

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Prosperity is a shared endeavor.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Its roots are long and deep --

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
its foundations, I've tried to show,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
exist already, inside each of us.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000
So this is not about

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
standing in the way of development.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
It's not about

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000
overthrowing capitalism.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
It's not about

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
trying to change human nature.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000
What we're doing here

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
is we're taking a few simple steps

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
towards an economics fit for purpose.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
And at the heart of that economics,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
we're placing a more credible,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
more robust,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
and more realistic vision

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
of what it means to be human.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Thank you very much.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:55.000
(Applause)

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
Chris Anderson: While they're taking the podium away, just a quick question.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
First of all, economists aren't supposed to be inspiring,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
so you may need to work on the tone a little.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
(Laughter)

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Can you picture the politicians ever buying into this?

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
I mean, can you picture

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
a politician standing up in Britain and saying,

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
"GDP fell two percent this year. Good news!

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
We're actually all happier, and a country's more beautiful,

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
and our lives are better."

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Tim Jackson: Well that's clearly not what you're doing.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
You're not making news out of things falling down.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
You're making news out of the things that tell you that we're flourishing.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
Can I picture politicians doing it?

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Actually, I already am seeing a little bit of it.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
When we first started this kind of work,

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
politicians would stand up, treasury spokesmen would stand up,

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
and accuse us of wanting to go back and live in caves.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
And actually in the period

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000
through which we've been working over the last 18 years --

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
partly because of the financial crisis

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
and a little bit of humility in the profession of economics --

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
actually people are engaging in this issue

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.000
in all sorts of countries around the world.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
CA: But is it mainly politicians who are going to have to get their act together,

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
or is it going to be more just civil society and companies?

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
TJ: It has to be companies. It has to be civil society.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
But it has to have political leadership.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
This is a kind of agenda,

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
which actually politicians themselves

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
are kind of caught in that dilemma,

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
because they're hooked on the growth model themselves.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
But actually opening up the space

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
to think about different ways of governing,

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
different kinds of politics,

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
and creating the space

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
for civil society and businesses to operate differently --

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
absolutely vital.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
CA: And if someone could convince you

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
that we actually can make the -- what was it? --

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
the 130-fold improvement in efficiency,

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
of reduction of carbon footprint,

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
would you then actually like that picture of economic growth

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
into more knowledge-based goods?

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
TJ: I would still want to know that you could do that

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
and get below zero by the end of the century,

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
in terms of taking carbon out of the atmosphere,

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
and solve the problem of biodiversity

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
and reduce the impact on land use

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
and do something about the erosion of topsoils and the quality of water.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
If you can convince me we can do all that,

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
then, yes, I would take the two percent.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
CA: Tim, thank you for a very important talk. Thank you.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000
(Applause)
