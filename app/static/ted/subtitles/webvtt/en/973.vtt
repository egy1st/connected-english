00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I've been fascinated for a lifetime

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
by the beauty, form and function

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
of giant bluefin tuna.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Bluefin are warmblooded like us.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
They're the largest of the tunas,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
the second-largest fish in the sea -- bony fish.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
They actually are a fish

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
that is endothermic --

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
powers through the ocean with warm muscles like a mammal.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
That's one of our bluefin at the Monterey Bay Aquarium.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
You can see in its shape and its streamlined design

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
it's powered for ocean swimming.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It flies through the ocean on its pectoral fins, gets lift,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
powers its movements

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
with a lunate tail.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
It's actually got a naked skin for most of its body,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
so it reduces friction with the water.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
This is what one of nature's finest machines.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Now, bluefin

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
were revered by Man

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
for all of human history.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
For 4,000 years, we fished sustainably for this animal,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and it's evidenced

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
in the art that we see

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
from thousands of years ago.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Bluefin are in cave paintings in France.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
They're on coins

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
that date back 3,000 years.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
This fish was revered by humankind.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
It was fished sustainably

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
till all of time,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
except for our generation.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Bluefin are pursued wherever they go --

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
there is a gold rush on Earth,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and this is a gold rush for bluefin.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
There are traps that fish sustainably

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
up until recently.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And yet, the type of fishing going on today,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
with pens, with enormous stakes,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
is really wiping bluefin

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
ecologically off the planet.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Now bluefin, in general,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
goes to one place: Japan.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Some of you may be guilty

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
of having contributed to the demise of bluefin.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
They're delectable muscle,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
rich in fat --

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
absolutely taste delicious.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And that's their problem; we're eating them to death.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Now in the Atlantic, the story is pretty simple.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Bluefin have two populations: one large, one small.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
The North American population

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
is fished at about 2,000 ton.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
The European population and North African -- the Eastern bluefin tuna --

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
is fished at tremendous levels:

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
50,000 tons over the last decade almost every year.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
The result is whether you're looking

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
at the West or the Eastern bluefin population,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
there's been tremendous decline on both sides,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
as much as 90 percent

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
if you go back with your baseline

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
to 1950.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
For that, bluefin have been given a status

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
equivalent to tigers, to lions,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
to certain African elephants

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and to pandas.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
These fish have been proposed

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
for an endangered species listing in the past two months.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
They were voted on and rejected

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
just two weeks ago,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
despite outstanding science

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
that shows from two committees

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
this fish meets the criteria of CITES I.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And if it's tunas you don't care about,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
perhaps you might be interested

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
that international long lines and pursing

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
chase down tunas and bycatch animals

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
such as leatherbacks, sharks,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
marlin, albatross.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
These animals and their demise

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
occurs in the tuna fisheries.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
The challenge we face

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
is that we know very little about tuna,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
and everyone in the room knows what it looks like

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
when an African lion

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
takes down its prey.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
I doubt anyone has seen a giant bluefin feed.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
This tuna symbolizes

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
what's the problem for all of us in the room.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
It's the 21st century, but we really have only just begun

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
to really study our oceans in a deep way.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Technology has come of age

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
that's allowing us to see the Earth from space

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and go deep into the seas remotely.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And we've got to use these technologies immediately

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
to get a better understanding

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
of how our ocean realm works.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Most of us from the ship -- even I --

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
look out at the ocean and see this homogeneous sea.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
We don't know where the structure is.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
We can't tell where are the watering holes

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
like we can on an African plain.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
We can't see the corridors,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
and we can't see what it is

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
that brings together a tuna,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
a leatherback and an albatross.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
We're only just beginning to understand

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
how the physical oceanography

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
and the biological oceanography

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
come together

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
to create a seasonal force

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
that actually causes the upwelling

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
that might make a hot spot a hope spot.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
The reasons these challenges are great

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
is that technically it's difficult to go to sea.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
It's hard to study a bluefin on its turf,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
the entire Pacific realm.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
It's really tough to get up close and personal with a mako shark

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
and try to put a tag on it.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
And then imagine being Bruce Mate's team from OSU,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
getting up close to a blue whale

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
and fixing a tag on the blue whale that stays,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
an engineering challenge

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
we've yet to really overcome.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
So the story of our team, a dedicated team,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
is fish and chips.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
We basically are taking

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
the same satellite phone parts,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
or the same parts that are in your computer, chips.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
We're putting them together in unusual ways,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
and this is taking us into the ocean realm

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
like never before.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And for the first time,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
we're able to watch the journey of a tuna beneath the ocean

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
using light and photons

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
to measure sunrise and sunset.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Now, I've been working with tunas for over 15 years.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
I have the privilege of being a partner

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
with the Monterey Bay Aquarium.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
We've actually taken a sliver of the ocean,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
put it behind glass,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
and we together

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
have put bluefin tuna and yellowfin tuna on display.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
When the veil of bubbles lifts every morning,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
we can actually see a community from the Pelagic ocean,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
one of the only places on Earth

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
you can see giant bluefin swim by.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
We can see in their beauty of form and function,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
their ceaseless activity.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
They're flying through their space, ocean space.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
And we can bring two million people a year

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
into contact with this fish

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
and show them its beauty.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Behind the scenes is a working lab at Stanford University

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
partnered with the Monterey Bay Aquarium.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Here, for over 14 or 15 years,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
we've actually brought in

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
both bluefin and yellowfin in captivity.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
We'd been studying these fish,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
but first we had to learn how to husbandry them.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
What do they like to eat?

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
What is it that they're happy with?

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
We go in the tanks with the tuna -- we touch their naked skin --

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
it's pretty amazing. It feels wonderful.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
And then, better yet,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
we've got our own version of tuna whisperers,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
our own Chuck Farwell, Alex Norton,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
who can take a big tuna

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
and in one motion,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
put it into an envelope of water,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
so that we can actually work with the tuna

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
and learn the techniques it takes

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
to not injure this fish

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
who never sees a boundary in the open sea.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Jeff and Jason there, are scientists

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
who are going to take a tuna

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
and put it in the equivalent of a treadmill, a flume.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
And that tuna thinks it's going to Japan, but it's staying in place.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
We're actually measuring its oxygen consumption,

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
its energy consumption.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
We're taking this data and building better models.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
And when I see that tuna -- this is my favorite view --

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
I begin to wonder:

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
how did this fish solve the longitude problem before we did?

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
So take a look at that animal.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
That's the closest you'll probably ever get.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Now, the activities from the lab

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
have taught us now how to go out in the open ocean.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
So in a program called Tag-A-Giant

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
we've actually gone from Ireland to Canada,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
from Corsica to Spain.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
We've fished with many nations around the world

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
in an effort to basically

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
put electronic computers

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
inside giant tunas.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
We've actually tagged 1,100 tunas.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
And I'm going to show you three clips,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
because I tagged 1,100 tunas.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
It's a very hard process, but it's a ballet.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
We bring the tuna out, we measure it.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000
A team of fishers, captains, scientists and technicians

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
work together to keep this animal out of the ocean

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
for about four to five minutes.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
We put water over its gills, give it oxygen.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
And then with a lot of effort, after tagging,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
putting in the computer,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
making sure the stalk is sticking out so it senses the environment,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
we send this fish back into the sea.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
And when it goes, we're always happy.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
We see a flick of the tail.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
And from our data that gets collected,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
when that tag comes back,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
because a fisher returns it

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
for a thousand-dollar reward,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
we can get tracks beneath the sea

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
for up to five years now,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
on a backboned animal.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Now sometimes the tunas are really large,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
such as this fish off Nantucket.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
But that's about half the size

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
of the biggest tuna we've ever tagged.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
It takes a human effort,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
a team effort, to bring the fish in.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
In this case, what we're going to do

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
is put a pop-up satellite archival tag on the tuna.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
This tag rides on the tuna,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
senses the environment around the tuna

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
and actually will come off the fish,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
detach, float to the surface

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
and send back to Earth-orbiting satellites

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
position data estimated by math on the tag,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
pressure data and temperature data.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
And so what we get then from the pop-up satellite tag

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
is we get away from having to have a human interaction

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
to recapture the tag.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Both the electronic tags I'm talking about are expensive.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
These tags have been engineered

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
by a variety of teams in North America.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
They are some of our finest instruments,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
our new technology in the ocean today.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
One community in general

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
has given more to help us than any other community.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
And that's the fisheries off the state of North Carolina.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
There are two villages, Harris and Morehead City,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
every winter for over a decade,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
held a party called Tag-A-Giant,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
and together, fishers worked with us

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
to tag 800 to 900 fish.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
In this case, we're actually going to measure the fish.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
We're going to do something that in recent years we've started:

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
take a mucus sample.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
Watch how shiny the skin is; you can see my reflection there.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
And from that mucus, we can get gene profiles,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
we can get information on gender,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
checking the pop-up tag one more time,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
and then it's out in the ocean.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
And this is my favorite.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000
With the help of my former postdoc, Gareth Lawson,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
this is a gorgeous picture of a single tuna.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
This tuna is actually moving on a numerical ocean.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
The warm is the Gulf Stream,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
the cold up there in the Gulf of Maine.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.000
That's where the tuna wants to go -- it wants to forage on schools of herring --

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
but it can't get there. It's too cold.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
But then it warms up, and the tuna pops in, gets some fish,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
maybe comes back to home base,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
goes in again

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
and then comes back to winter down there in North Carolina

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
and then on to the Bahamas.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
And my favorite scene, three tunas going into the Gulf of Mexico.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Three tunas tagged.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Astronomically, we're calculating positions.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
They're coming together. That could be tuna sex --

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
and there it is.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
That is where the tuna spawn.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
So from data like this,

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
we're able now to put the map up,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
and in this map

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
you see thousands of positions

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
generated by this decade and a half of tagging.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
And now we're showing that tunas on the western side

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
go to the eastern side.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
So two populations of tunas --

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
that is, we have a Gulf population, one that we can tag --

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
they go to the Gulf of Mexico, I showed you that --

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
and a second population.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Living amongst our tunas -- our North American tunas --

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
are European tunas that go back to the Med.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
On the hot spots -- the hope spots --

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
they're mixed populations.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
And so what we've done with the science

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
is we're showing the International Commission,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
building new models,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
showing them that a two-stock no-mixing model --

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
to this day, used to reject

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
the CITES treaty --

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
that model isn't the right model.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
This model, a model of overlap,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
is the way to move forward.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
So we can then predict

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
where management places should be.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Places like the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
are places where the single species,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
the single population, can be captured.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
These become forthright in places we need to protect.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
The center of the Atlantic where the mixing is,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
I could imagine a policy that lets Canada and America fish,

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
because they manage their fisheries well,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
they're doing a good job.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
But in the international realm,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
where fishing and overfishing has really gone wild,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
these are the places that we have to make hope spots in.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
That's the size they have to be to protect the bluefin tuna.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Now in a second project

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
called Tagging of Pacific Pelagics,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
we took on the planet as a team,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
those of us in the Census of Marine Life.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
And, funded primarily through Sloan Foundation and others,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
we were able to actually go in, in our project --

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
we're one of 17 field programs

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
and begin to take on tagging large numbers of predators,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
not just tunas.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
So what we've done

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
is actually gone up to tag salmon shark in Alaska,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
met salmon shark on their home territory,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
followed them catching salmon

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
and then went in and figured out

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
that, if we take a salmon and put it on a line,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
we can actually take up a salmon shark --

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
This is the cousin of the white shark --

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
and very carefully --

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
note, I say "very carefully," --

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
we can actually keep it calm,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
put a hose in its mouth, keep it off the deck

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
and then tag it with a satellite tag.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
That satellite tag will now have your shark phone home

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
and send in a message.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
And that shark leaping there, if you look carefully, has an antenna.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
It's a free swimming shark with a satellite tag

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
jumping after salmon,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
sending home its data.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Salmon sharks aren't the only sharks we tag.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
But there goes salmon sharks with this meter-level resolution

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
on an ocean of temperature -- warm colors are warmer.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Salmon sharks go down

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
to the tropics to pup

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
and come into Monterey.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Now right next door in Monterey and up at the Farallones

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
are a white shark team led by Scott Anderson -- there --

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
and Sal Jorgensen.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
They can throw out a target --

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
it's a carpet shaped like a seal --

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
and in will come a white shark, a curious critter

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
that will come right up to our 16-ft. boat.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
It's a several thousand-pound animal.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
And we'll wind in the target.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
And we'll place an acoustic tag

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
that says, "OMSHARK 10165,"

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
or something like that, acoustically with a ping.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
And then we'll put on a satellite tag

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
that will give us the long-distance journeys

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
with the light-based geolocation algorithms

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
solved on the computer that's on the fish.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
So in this case, Sal's looking at two tags there,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
and there they are: the white sharks of California

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
going off to the white shark cafe and coming back.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
We also tag makos with our NOAA colleagues,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
blue sharks.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
And now, together, what we can see

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
on this ocean of color that's temperature,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
we can see ten-day worms of makos and salmon sharks.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
We have white sharks and blue sharks.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000
For the first time,

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000
an ecoscape as large as ocean-scale,

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
showing where the sharks go.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
The tuna team from TOPP has done the unthinkable:

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
three teams tagged 1,700 tunas,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
bluefin, yellowfin and albacore

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000
all at the same time --

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
carefully rehearsed tagging programs

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
in which we go out, pick up juvenile tunas,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
put in the tags that actually have the sensors,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
stick out the tuna

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
and then let them go.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
They get returned, and when they get returned,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
here on a NASA numerical ocean

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
you can see bluefin in blue

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
go across their corridor,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
returning to the Western Pacific.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Our team from UCSC has tagged elephant seals

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
with tags that are glued on their heads, that come off when they slough.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
These elephant seals cover half an ocean,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
take data down to 1,800 feet --

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
amazing data.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
And then there's Scott Shaffer and our shearwaters

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
wearing tuna tags, light-based tags,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000
that now are going to take you from New Zealand to Monterey and back,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
journeys of 35,000 nautical miles

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
we had never seen before.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
But now with light-based geolocation tags that are very small,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
we can actually see these journeys.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
Same thing with Laysan albatross

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
who travel an entire ocean

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000
on a trip sometimes,

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
up to the same zone the tunas use.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
You can see why they might be caught.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Then there's George Schillinger and our leatherback team out of Playa Grande

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
tagging leatherbacks

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
that go right past where we are.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
And Scott Benson's team

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
that showed that leatherbacks go from Indonesia

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
all the way to Monterey.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
So what we can see on this moving ocean

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
is we can finally see where the predators are.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
We can actually see how they're using ecospaces

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
as large as an ocean.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
And from this information,

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
we can begin to map the hope spots.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
So this is just three years of data right here --

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
and there's a decade of this data.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000
We see the pulse and the seasonal activities

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
that these animals are going on.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
So what we're able to do with this information

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
is boil it down to hot spots,

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
4,000 deployments,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
a huge herculean task,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
2,000 tags

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
in an area, shown here for the first time,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
off the California coast,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
that appears to be a gathering place.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
And then for sort of an encore from these animals,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
they're helping us.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
They're carrying instruments

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
that are actually taking data down to 2,000 meters.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
They're taking information from our planet

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
at very critical places like Antarctica and the Poles.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
Those are seals from many countries

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
being released

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
who are sampling underneath the ice sheets

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000
and giving us temperature data of oceanographic quality

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
on both poles.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
This data, when visualized, is captivating to watch.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
We still haven't figured out best how to visualize the data.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
And then, as these animals swim

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
and give us the information

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
that's important to climate issues,

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
we also think it's critical

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
to get this information to the public,

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
to engage the public with this kind of data.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
We did this with the Great Turtle Race --

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000
tagged turtles, brought in four million hits.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
And now with Google's Oceans,

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
we can actually put a white shark in that ocean.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
And when we do and it swims,

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
we see this magnificent bathymetry

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
that the shark knows is there on its path

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
as it goes from California to Hawaii.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
But maybe Mission Blue

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
can fill in that ocean that we can't see.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
We've got the capacity, NASA has the ocean.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
We just need to put it together.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
So in conclusion,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
we know where Yellowstone is for North America;

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
it's off our coast.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
We have the technology that's shown us where it is.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
What we need to think about perhaps for Mission Blue

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
is increasing the biologging capacity.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
How is it that we can actually

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
take this type of activity elsewhere?

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
And then finally -- to basically get the message home --

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
maybe use live links

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
from animals such as blue whales and white sharks.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
Make killer apps, if you will.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000
A lot of people are excited

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000
when sharks actually went under the Golden Gate Bridge.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
Let's connect the public to this activity right on their iPhone.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
That way we do away with a few internet myths.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
So we can save the bluefin tuna.

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000
We can save the white shark.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000
We have the science and technology.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000
Hope is here. Yes we can.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
We need just to apply this capacity

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
further in the oceans.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
Thank you.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
(Applause)
