WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
We are here today

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
because [the] United Nations

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
have defined goals

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
for the progress of countries.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
They're called Millennium Development Goals.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And the reason I really like these goals

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
is that there are eight of them.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And by specifying eight different goals,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
the United Nations has said

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
that there are so many things needed

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
to change in a country

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
in order to get the good life for people.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Look here -- you have to end poverty,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
education, gender,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
child and maternal health,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
control infections, protect the environment

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and get the good global links between nations

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
in every aspect

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
from aid to trade.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
There's a second reason I like these development goals,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and that is because each and every one is measured.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Take child mortality;

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
the aim here is to reduce child mortality

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
by two-thirds,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
from 1990 to 2015.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
That's a four percent reduction per year --

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and this, with measuring.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
That's what makes the difference

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
between political talking like this

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and really going for the important thing,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
a better life for people.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And what I'm so happy about with this

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
is that we have already documented

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
that there are many countries

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
in Asia, in the Middle East,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
in Latin America and East Europe

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
that [are] reducing with this rate.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
And even mighty Brazil is going down with five percent per year,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and Turkey with seven percent per year.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
So there's good news.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
But then I hear people saying, "There is no progress in Africa.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And there's not even statistics on Africa

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
to know what is happening."

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
I'll prove them wrong on both points.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Come with me to the wonderful world of statistics.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I bring you to the webpage, ChildMortality.org,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
where you can take deaths in children

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
below five years of age for all countries --

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
it's done by U.N. specialists.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And I will take Kenya as an example.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Here you see the data.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Don't panic -- don't panic now, I'll help you through this.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
It looks nasty, like in college

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
when you didn't like statistics.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
But first thing, when you see dots like this,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
you have to ask yourself:

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
from where do the data come?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
What is the origin of the data?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Is it so that in Kenya,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
there are doctors and other specialists

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
who write the death certificate at the death of the child

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and it's sent to the statistical office?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
No -- low-income countries like Kenya

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
still don't have that level of organization.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
It exists, but it's not complete

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
because so many deaths occur in the home

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
with the family,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and it's not registered.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
What we rely on is not an incomplete system.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
We have interviews, we have surveys.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And this is highly professional

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
female interviewers

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
who sit down for one hour with a woman

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
and ask her about [her] birth history.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
How many children did you have?

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Are they alive?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
If they died, at what age and what year?

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
And then this is done in a representative sample

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
of thousands of women in the country

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
and put together in what used to be called

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
a demographic health survey report.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
But these surveys are costly,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
so they can only be done [in] three- to five-year intervals.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
But they have good quality.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
So this is a limitation.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And all these colored lines here are results;

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
each color is one survey.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
But that's too complicated for today, so I'll simplify it for you,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and I give you one average point for each survey.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
This was 1977, 1988,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
1992, '97

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
and 2002.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And when the experts in the U.N.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
have got these surveys in place in their database,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
then they use advanced mathematical formulas

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
to produce a trend line, and the trend line looks like this.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
See here -- it's the best fit they can get of this point.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
But watch out --

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
they continue the line

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
beyond the last point

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
out into nothing.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
And they estimated that in 2008,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Kenya had per child mortality of 128.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And I was sad,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
because we could see

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
this reversal in Kenya

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
with an increased child mortality in the 90s.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
It was so tragic.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
But in June, I got a mail in my inbox

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
from Demographic Health Surveys,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
and it showed good news from Kenya.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
I was so happy.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
This was the estimate of the new survey.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Then it just took another three months

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
for [the] U.N. to get it into their server,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and on Friday we got the new trend line --

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
it was down here.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Isn't it nice -- isn't it nice, yeah?

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
I was actually, on Friday, sitting in front of my computer,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
and I saw the death rate fall

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
from 128 to 84 just that morning.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
So we celebrated.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
But now, when you have this trend line,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
how do we measure progress?

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
I'm going into some details here,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
because [the] U.N. do it like this.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
They start [in] 1990 -- they measure to 2009.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
They say, "0.9 percent, no progress."

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
That's unfair.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
As a professor, I think I have the right to propose something differently.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
I would say, at least do this --

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
10 years is enough to follow the trend.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
It's two surveys, and you can see what's happening now.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
They have 2.4 percent.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Had I been in the Ministry of Health in Kenya,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
I may have joined these two points.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
So what I'm telling you

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
is that we know the child mortality.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
We have a decent trend.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
It's coming into some tricky things then

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
when we are measuring MDGs.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And the reason here for Africa is especially important,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
because '90s was a bad decade,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
not only in Kenya, but across Africa.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
The HIV epidemic peaked.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
There was resistance for the old malaria drugs, until we got the new drugs.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
We got, later, the mosquito netting.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
And there was socio-economic problems,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
which are now being solved at a much better scale.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
So look at the average here --

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
this is the average for all of sub-Saharan Africa.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And [the] U.N. says

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
it's a reduction with 1.8 percent.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Now this sounds a little theoretical,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
but it's not so theoretical.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
You know, these economists,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
they love money, they want more and more of it, they want it to grow.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
So they calculate the percent annual growth rate of [the] economy.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
We in public health, we hate child death,

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
so we want less and less and less of child deaths.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
So we calculate the percent reduction per year,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
but it's sort of the same percentage.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
If your economy grows with four percent,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
you ought to reduce child mortality four percent;

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
if it's used well and people are really involved

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
and can get the use of the resources in the way they want it.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
So is this fair now to measure this over 19 years?

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
An economist would never do that.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
I have just divided it into two periods.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
In the 90s, only 1.2 percent,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
only 1.2 percent.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Whereas now, second gear --

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
it's like Africa had first gear,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
now they go into second gear.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
But even this

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
is not a fair representation of Africa,

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
because it's an average,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
it's an average speed of reduction in Africa.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
And look here when I take you into my bubble graphs.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Still here,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
child death per 1,000 on that axis.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Here we have [the] year.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
And I'm now giving you a wider picture than the MDG.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
I start 50 years ago

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
when Africa celebrated independence in most countries.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
I give you Congo, which was high,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Ghana -- lower. And Kenya -- even lower.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
And what has happened over the years since then? Here we go.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
You can see, with independence, literacy improved

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
and vaccinations started, smallpox was eradicated,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
hygiene was improved, and things got better.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
But then, in the '80s, watch out here.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Congo got into civil war,

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
and they leveled off here.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Ghana got very ahead, fast.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
This was the backlash in Kenya, and Ghana bypassed,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
but then Kenya and Ghana go down together --

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
still a standstill in Congo.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
That's where we are today.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
You can see it doesn't make sense

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
to make an average of this zero improvement

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
and this very fast improvement.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Time has come

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
to stop thinking about sub-Saharan Africa as one place.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Their countries are so different,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
and they merit to be recognized in the same way,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
as we don't talk about Europe as one place.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
I can tell you that the economy in Greece and Sweden are very different --

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000
everyone knows that.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And they are judged, each country, on how they are doing.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
So let me show the wider picture.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
My country, Sweden:

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
1800, we were up there.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
What a strange personality disorder we must have,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
counting the children so meticulously in spite of a high child death rate.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
It's very strange. It's sort of embarrassing.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
But we had that habit in Sweden, you know,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
that we counted all the child deaths,

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
even if we didn't do anything about it.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
And then, you see, these were famine years.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
These were bad years, and people got fed up with Sweden.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
My ancestors moved to the United States.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
And eventually, soon they started to get better and better here.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And here we got better education, and we got health service,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
and child mortality came down.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
We never had a war; Sweden was in peace all this time.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
But look, the rate of lowering

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
in Sweden

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
was not fast.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Sweden achieved a low child mortality

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
because we started early.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
We had primary school actually

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
started in 1842.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
And then you get that wonderful effect

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
when we got female literacy

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000
one generation later.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
You have to realize that the investments we do in progress

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
are long-term investments.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
It's not about just five years --

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
it's long-term investments.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
And Sweden never reached [the] Millennium Development Goal rate,

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
3.1 percent when I calculated.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
So we are off track -- that's what Sweden is.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
But you don't talk about it so much.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
We want others to be better than we were, and indeed, others have been better.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Let me show you Thailand,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
see what a success story, Thailand from the 1960s --

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
how they went down here

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
and reached almost the same child mortality levels as Sweden.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
And I'll give you another story -- Egypt,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
the most hidden, glorious success in public health.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Egypt was up here in 1960,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
higher than Congo.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
The Nile Delta was a misery for children

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
with diarrheal disease

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
and malaria and a lot of problems.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
And then they got the Aswan Dam. They got electricity in their homes,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
they increased education

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
and they got primary health care.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
And down they went, you know.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000
And they got safer water, they eradicated malaria.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
And isn't it a success story.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Millennium Development Goal rates for child mortality

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
is fully possible.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
And the good thing is

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
that Ghana today is going with the same rate

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
as Egypt did at its fastest.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Kenya is now speeding up.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Here we have a problem.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
We have a severe problem in countries which are at a standstill.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Now, let me now bring you to a wider picture,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
a wider picture of child mortality.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
I'm going to show you the relationship

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000
between child mortality on this axis here --

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
this axis here is child mortality --

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
and here I have the family size.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
The relationship between child mortality and family size.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
One, two, three, four children per woman:

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
six, seven, eight children per woman.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
This is, once again, 1960 --

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
50 years ago.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Each bubble is a country --

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
the color, you can see, a continent.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
The dark blue here is sub-Saharan Africa.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
And the size of the bubble is the population.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
And these are

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
the so-called "developing" countries.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
They had high, or very high, child mortality

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
and family size, six to eight.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
And the ones over there,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
they were so-called Western countries.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
They had low child mortality

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
and small families.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
What has happened?

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
What I want you [to do] now is to see with your own eyes

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
the relation between fall in child mortality

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
and decrease in family size.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
I just want not to have any room for doubt --

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
you have to see that for yourself.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
This is what happened. Now I start the world.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Here we come down with the eradication of

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
smallpox, better education,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
health service.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
It got down there -- China comes into the Western box here.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
And here Brazil is in the Western Box.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
India is approaching. The first African countries coming into the Western box,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
and we get a lot a new neighbors.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Welcome to a decent life.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Come on. We want everyone down there.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
This is the vision we have, isn't it.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
And look now, the first African countries here are coming in.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
There we are today.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
There is no such thing

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
as a "Western world" and "developing world."

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
This is the report from [the] U.N.,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
which came out on Friday.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
It's very good -- "Levels and Trends in Child Mortality" --

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
except this page.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
This page is very bad;

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
it's a categorization of countries.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
It labels "developing countries," -- I can read from the list here --

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
developing countries: Republic of Korea -- South Korea.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Huh?

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
They get Samsung, how can they be [a] developing country?

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
They have here Singapore.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
They have the lowest child mortality in the world, Singapore.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
They bypassed Sweden five years ago,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
and they are labeled a developing country.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
They have here Qatar.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
It's the richest country in the world with Al Jazeera.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
How the heck could they be [a] developing country?

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
This is crap.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
(Applause)

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
The rest here is good -- the rest is good.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
We have to have a modern concept,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
which fits to the data.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
And we have to realize

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
that we are all going to into this, down to here.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
What is the importance now with the relations here.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Look -- even if we look in Africa --

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
these are the African countries.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
You can clearly see the relation with falling child mortality

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
and decreasing family size,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
even within Africa.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
It's very clear that this is what happens.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
And a very important piece of research came out on Friday

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
showing that almost 50 percent

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
of the fall in child mortality

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
can be attributed to female education.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
That is, when we get girls in school,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
we'll get an impact 15 to 20 years later,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
which is a secular trend which is very strong.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
That's why we must have that long-term perspective,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
but we must measure the impact

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
over 10-year periods.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
It's fully possible

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
to get child mortality down in all of these countries

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
and to get them down in the corner

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
where we all would like to live together.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
And of course, lowering child mortality

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
is a matter of utmost importance

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
from humanitarian aspects.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
It's a decent life for children,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
we are talking about.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
But it is also a strategic investment

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
in the future of all mankind,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
because it's about the environment.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
We will not be able to manage the environment

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
and avoid the terrible climate crisis

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
if we don't stabilize the world population.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Let's be clear about that.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
And the way to do that,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
that is to get child mortality down, get access to family planning

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
and behind that drive female education.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
And that is fully possible. Let's do it.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Thank you very much.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:12.000
(Applause)
