00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Imagine, if you will -- a gift.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I'd like for you to picture it in your mind.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It's not too big --

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
about the size of a golf ball.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
So envision what it looks like all wrapped up.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
But before I show you what's inside,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I will tell you, it's going to do incredible things for you.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It will bring all of your family together.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
You will feel loved and appreciated like never before

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and reconnect with friends and acquaintances

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
you haven't heard from in years.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Adoration and admiration

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
will overwhelm you.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
It will recalibrate what's most important in your life.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
It will redefine your sense

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
of spirituality and faith.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
You'll have a new understanding

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and trust in your body.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
You'll have unsurpassed vitality and energy.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
You'll expand your vocabulary,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
meet new people,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and you'll have a healthier lifestyle.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
And get this --

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
you'll have an eight-week vacation

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
of doing absolutely nothing.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
You'll eat countless gourmet meals.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Flowers will arrive by the truckload.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
People will say to you,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
"You look great. Have you had any work done?"

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And you'll have a lifetime supply

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
of good drugs.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
You'll be challenged, inspired,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
motivated and humbled.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Your life will have new meaning.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Peace, health,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
serenity, happiness,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
nirvana.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
The price?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
$55,000,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and that's an incredible deal.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
By now I know you're dying to know

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
what it is and where you can get one.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Does Amazon carry it?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Does it have the Apple logo on it?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Is there a waiting list?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Not likely.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
This gift came to me about five months ago.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
It looked more like this when it was all wrapped up --

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
not quite so pretty.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
And this,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and then this.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
It was a rare gem --

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
a brain tumor,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
hemangioblastoma --

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
the gift that keeps on giving.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
And while I'm okay now,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
I wouldn't wish this gift for you.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I'm not sure you'd want it.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
But I wouldn't change my experience.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
It profoundly altered my life

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
in ways I didn't expect

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
in all the ways I just shared with you.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
So the next time you're faced

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
with something that's unexpected,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
unwanted and uncertain,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
consider

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
that it just may be a gift.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
(Applause)
