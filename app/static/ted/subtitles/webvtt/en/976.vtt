WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Sometimes I go browsing

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
[through] a very old magazine.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I found this observation test

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
about the story of the ark.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And the artist that drew this observation test

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
did some errors, had some mistakes --

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
there are more or less 12 mistakes.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Some of them are very easy.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
There is a funnel, an aerial part,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
a lamp and clockwork key on the ark.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Some of them are about the animals, the number.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
But there is a much more fundamental mistake

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
in the overall story of the ark

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that's not reported here.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And this problem is: where are the plants?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
So now we have God

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
that is going to submerge Earth permanently

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
or at least for a very long period,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and no one is taking care of plants.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Noah needed to take two of every kind of bird,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
of every kind of animal,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
of every kind of creature that moves,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
but no mention about plants.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Why?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
In another part of the same story,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
all the living creatures

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
are just the living creatures

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
that came out from the ark,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
so birds, livestock and wild animals.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Plants are not living creatures --

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
this is the point.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
That is a point that is not

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
coming out from the Bible,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
but it's something that

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
really accompanied humanity.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Let's have a look at this nice code

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
that is coming from a Renaissance book.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Here we have the description

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
of the order of nature.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
It's a nice description because it's starting from left --

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
you have the stones --

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
immediately after the stones, the plants

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
that are just able to live.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
We have the animals that are able to live and to sense,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and on the top of the pyramid,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
there is the man.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
This is not the common man.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
The "Homo studiosus" -- the studying man.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
This is quite comforting

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
for people like me -- I'm a professor --

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
this to be over there on the top of creation.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
But it's something completely wrong.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
You know very well about professors.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
But it's also wrong about plants,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
because plants are not just able to live;

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
they are able to sense.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
They are much more sophisticated

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
in sensing than animals.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Just to give you an example,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
every single root apex

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
is able to detect and to monitor

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
concurrently and continuously

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
at least 15 different chemical

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and physical parameters.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And they also are able to show and to exhibit

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
such a wonderful and complex behavior

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
that can be described just with the term of intelligence.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Well, but this is something --

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
this underestimation of plants is something

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
that is always with us.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Let's have a look at this short movie now.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
We have David Attenborough.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Now David Attenborough is really a plant lover;

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
he did some of the most beautiful movies

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
about plant behavior.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Now, when he speaks about plants,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
everything is correct.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
When he speaks about animals,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
[he] tends to remove the fact

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
that plants exist.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
The blue whale,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
the biggest creature that exists on the planet --

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
that is wrong, completely wrong.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
The blue whale, it's a dwarf

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
if compared with the real biggest creature

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
that exists on the planet --

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
that is, this wonderful,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
magnificent Sequoiadendron giganteum.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
(Applause)

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And this is a living organism

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
that has a mass of at least 2,000 tons.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Now, the story

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
that plants are some low-level organisms

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
has been formalized

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
many times ago by Aristotle,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
that in "De Anima" --

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
that is a very influential book for the Western civilization --

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
wrote that the plants are on the edge

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
between living and not living.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
They have just a kind of very low-level soul.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
It's called the vegetative soul,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
because they lack movement,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
and so they don't need to sense.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Let's see.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Okay, some of the movements of the plants are very well-known.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
This is a very fast movement.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
This is a Dionaea, a Venus fly trap

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
hunting snails --

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
sorry for the snail.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
This has been something that has been refused for centuries,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
despite the evidence.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
No one can say that the plants were able to eat an animal,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
because it was against the order of nature.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
But plants are also able

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
to show a lot of movement.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Some of them are very well known, like the flowering.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
It's just a question to use some techniques

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
like the time lapse.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Some of them are much more sophisticated.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Look at this young bean

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
that is moving to catch the light every time.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
And it's really so graceful;

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
it's like a dancing angel.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
They are also able to play --

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
they are really playing.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
These are young sunflowers,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
and what they are doing

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
cannot be described

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
with any other terms than playing.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
They are training themselves,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
as many young animals do,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
to the adult life

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
where they will be called to track the sun

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
all the day.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
They are able to respond to gravity, of course,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
so the shoots are growing

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
against the vector of gravity

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
and the roots toward the vector of gravity.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
But they are also able to sleep.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
This is one, Mimosa pudica.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
So during the night,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
they curl the leaves

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
and reduce the movement,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
and during the day, you have the opening of the leaves --

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
there is much more movement.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
This is interesting

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
because this sleeping machinery,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
it's perfectly conserved.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
It's the same in plants, in insects

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
and in animals.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
And so if you need to study this sleeping problem,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
it's easy to study on plants, for example,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
than in animals

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
and it's much more easy even ethically.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
It's a kind of vegetarian

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
experimentation.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Plants are even able to communicate --

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
they are extraordinary communicators.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
They communicate with other plants.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
They are able to distinguish kin and non-kin.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
They communicate

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
with plants of other species

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and they communicate with animals

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
by producing chemical volatiles,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
for example, during the pollination.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Now with the pollination, it's a very serious issue for plants,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
because they move the pollen from one flower to the other,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
yet they cannot move from one flower to the other.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
So they need a vector --

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
and this vector,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
it's normally an animal.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Many insects

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
have been used by plants as vectors

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
for the transport of the pollination,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
but not just insects; even birds, reptiles,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
and mammals like bats rats

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
are normally used for the transportation of the pollen.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
This is a serious business.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
We have the plants that are giving to the animals

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
a kind of sweet substance --

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
very energizing --

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
having in change this transportation of the pollen.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
But some plants are manipulating animals,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
like in the case of orchids

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
that promise sex and nectar

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
and give in change nothing

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
for the transportation of the pollen.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Now, there is a big problem

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
behind all this behavior that we have seen.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
How is it possible to do this without a brain?

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
We need to wait until 1880,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
when this big man,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Charles Darwin,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
publishes a wonderful, astonishing book

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
that starts a revolution.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
The title is "The Power of Movement in Plants."

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
No one was allowed to speak about movement in plants

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
before Charles Darwin.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
In his book,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
assisted by his son, Francis --

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
who was the first professor of plant physiology in the world, in Cambridge --

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
they took into consideration every single movement

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
for 500 pages.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
And in the last paragraph of the book,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
it's a kind of stylistic mark,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
because normally Charles Darwin stored,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
in the last paragraph of a book,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
the most important message.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
He wrote that,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
"It's hardly an exaggeration

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
to say that the tip of the radical

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
acts like the brain

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
of one of the lower animals."

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
This is not a metaphor.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
He wrote some very interesting letters to one of his friends

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
who was J.D. Hooker, or at that time, president of the Royal Society,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
so the maximum scientific authority in Britain

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
speaking about the brain in the plants.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Now, this is a root apex

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
growing against a slope.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
So you can recognize this kind of movement,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
the same movement that worms, snakes

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
and every animal

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
that are moving on the ground without legs

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
is able to display.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
And it's not an easy movement

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
because, to have this kind of movement,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
you need to move different regions of the root

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
and to synchronize these different regions

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
without having a brain.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
So we studied the root apex

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
and we found that there is a specific region

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
that is here, depicted in blue --

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
that is called the "transition zone."

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
And this region, it's a very small region --

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
it's less than one millimeter.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
And in this small region

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
you have the highest consumption

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
of oxygen in the plants

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
and more important,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
you have these kinds of signals here.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
The signals that you are seeing here are action potential,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
are the same signals

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
that the neurons of my brain, of our brain,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
use to exchange information.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Now we know that a root apex

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
has just a few hundred cells

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
that show this kind of feature,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
but we know how big

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
the root apparatus of a small plant, like a plant of rye.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
We have almost

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
14 million roots.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
We have 11 and a half million

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
root apex

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
and a total length of 600 or more kilometers

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
and a very high surface area.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Now let's imagine

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
that each single root apex

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
is working in network with all the others.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Here were have on the left, the Internet

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
and on the right, the root apparatus.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
They work in the same way.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
They are a network

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
of small computing machines,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
working in networks.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
And why are they so similar?

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Because they evolved

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
for the same reason:

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000
to survive predation.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
They work in the same way.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
So you can remove 90 percent of the root apparatus

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
and the plants [continue] to work.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
You can remove 90 percent of the Internet

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
and it is [continuing] to work.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
So, a suggestion

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
for the people working with networks:

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000
plants are able

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
to give you good suggestions

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
about how to evolve networks.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
And another possibility

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
is a technological possibility.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Let's imagine

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
that we can build robots

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
and robots that are inspired by plants.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Until now,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
the man was inspired

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
just by man or the animals

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
in producing a robot.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
We have the animaloid --

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
and the normal robots inspired by animals,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
insectoid, so on.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
We have the androids

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
that are inspired by man.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
But why have we not any plantoid?

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Well, if you want to fly,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
it's good that you look at birds --

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
to be inspired by birds.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
But if you want to explore soils,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
or if you want to colonize

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
new territory,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
to best thing that you can do is to be inspired by plants

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000
that are masters in doing this.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
We have another possibility

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
we are working [on] in our lab,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
[which] is to build hybrids.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
It's much more easy to build hybrids.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Hybrid means it's something

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
that's half living and half machine.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
It's much more easy to work with plants

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
than with animals.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
They have computing power,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000
they have electrical signals.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.000
The connection with the machine is much more easy,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
much more even ethically possible.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
And these are three possibilities

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
that we are working on

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
to build hybrids,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
driven by algae

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
or by the leaves at the end,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
by the most, most powerful parts of the plants,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
by the roots.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Well, thank you for your attention.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
And before I finish,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
I would like to reassure that no snails were harmed

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
in making this presentation.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Thank you.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000
(Applause)
