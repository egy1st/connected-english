WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
One of my favorite parts

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
of my job at the Gates Foundation

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
is that I get to travel to the developing world,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and I do that quite regularly.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And when I meet the mothers

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
in so many of these remote places,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I'm really struck by the things

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that we have in common.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
They want what we want for our children

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and that is for their children to grow up successful,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
to be healthy, and to have a successful life.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
But I also see lots of poverty,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and it's quite jarring,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
both in the scale and the scope of it.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
My first trip in India, I was in a person's home

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
where they had dirt floors, no running water,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
no electricity,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and that's really what I see all over the world.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So in short, I'm startled by all the things

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
that they don't have.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
But I am surprised by one thing that they do have:

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Coca-Cola.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Coke is everywhere.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
In fact, when I travel to the developing world,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Coke feels ubiquitous.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And so when I come back from these trips,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and I'm thinking about development,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and I'm flying home and I'm thinking,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
"We're trying to deliver condoms to people or vaccinations,"

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
you know, Coke's success kind of stops and makes you wonder:

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
how is it that they can get Coke

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
to these far-flung places?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
If they can do that,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
why can't governments and NGOs do the same thing?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And I'm not the first person to ask this question.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
But I think, as a community,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
we still have a lot to learn.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
It's staggering, if you think about Coca-Cola.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
They sell 1.5 billion servings

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
every single day.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
That's like every man, woman and child on the planet

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
having a serving of Coke every week.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
So why does this matter?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Well, if we're going to speed up the progress

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
and go even faster

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
on the set of Millennium Development Goals that we're set as a world,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
we need to learn from the innovators,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and those innovators

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
come from every single sector.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I feel that, if we can understand

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
what makes something like Coca-Cola ubiquitous,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
we can apply those lessons then for the public good.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Coke's success is relevant,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
because if we can analyze it, learn from it,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
then we can save lives.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
So that's why I took a bit of time to study Coke.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
And I think there are really three things

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
we can take away from Coca-Cola.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
They take real-time data

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and immediately feed it back into the product.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
They tap into local entrepreneurial talent,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and they do incredible marketing.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
So let's start with the data.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Now Coke has a very clear bottom line --

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
they report to a set of shareholders, they have to turn a profit.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
So they take the data,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
and they use it to measure progress.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
They have this very continuous feedback loop.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
They learn something, they put it back into the product,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
they put it back into the market.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
They have a whole team called "Knowledge and Insight."

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
It's a lot like other consumer companies.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
So if you're running Namibia for Coca-Cola,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and you have a 107 constituencies,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
you know where every can versus bottle

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
of Sprite, Fanta or Coke was sold,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
whether it was a corner store,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
a supermarket or a pushcart.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
So if sales start to drop,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
then the person can identify the problem

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
and address the issue.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Let's contrast that for a minute to development.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
In development, the evaluation comes

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
at the very end of the project.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
I've sat in a lot of those meetings,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and by then,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
it is way too late to use the data.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
I had somebody from an NGO

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
once describe it to me as bowling in the dark.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
They said, "You roll the ball, you hear some pins go down.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
It's dark, you can't see which one goes down until the lights come on,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
and then you an see your impact."

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Real-time data

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
turns on the lights.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
So what's the second thing that Coke's good at?

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
They're good at tapping into

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
that local entrepreneurial talent.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Coke's been in Africa since 1928,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
but most of the time they couldn't reach the distant markets,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
because they had a system that was a lot like in the developed world,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
which was a large truck rolling down the street.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
And in Africa, the remote places,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
it's hard to find a good road.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
But Coke noticed something --

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
they noticed that local people were taking the product, buying it in bulk

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
and then reselling it in these hard-to-reach places.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
And so they took a bit of time to learn about that.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
And they decided in 1990

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
that they wanted to start training the local entrepreneurs,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
giving them small loans.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
They set them up as what they called micro-distribution centers,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
and those local entrepreneurs then hire sales people,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
who go out with bicycles and pushcarts and wheelbarrows

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
to sell the product.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
There are now some 3,000 of these centers

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
employing about 15,000 people in Africa.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
In Tanzania and Uganda,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
they represent 90 percent

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
of Coke's sales.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Let's look at the development side.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
What is it that governments and NGOs

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
can learn from Coke?

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Governments and NGOs

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
need to tap into that local entrepreneurial talent as well,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
because the locals know how to reach

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
the very hard-to-serve places, their neighbors,

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
and they know what motivates them to make change.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
I think a great example of this

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
is Ethiopia's new health extension program.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
The government noticed in Ethiopia

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
that many of the people were so far away from a health clinic,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
they were over a day's travel away from a health clinic.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
So if you're in an emergency situation -- or if you're a mom about to deliver a baby --

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
forget it, to get to the health care center.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
They decided that wasn't good enough,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
so they went to India and studied the Indian state of Kerala

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
that also had a system like this,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
and they adapted it for Ethiopia.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
And in 2003, the government of Ethiopia

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
started this new system in their own country.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
They trained 35,000 health extension workers

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
to deliver care directly to the people.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
In just five years,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
their ratio went from one worker for every 30,000 people

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
to one worker for every 2,500 people.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Now, think about

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
how this can change people's lives.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Health extension workers can help with so many things,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
whether it's family planning, prenatal care,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
immunizations for the children,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
or advising the woman to get to the facility on time

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
for an on-time delivery.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
That is having real impact

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
in a country like Ethiopia,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
and it's why you see their child mortality numbers

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
coming down 25 percent

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
from 2000 to 2008.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
In Ethiopia, there are hundreds of thousands of children living

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
because of this health extension worker program.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
So what's the next step for Ethiopia?

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Well, they're already starting talk about this.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
They're starting to talk about, "How do you have the health community workers

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
generate their own ideas?

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
How do you incent them based on the impact that they're getting

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
out in those remote villages?"

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
That's how you tap into local entrepreneurial talent

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
and you unlock people's potential.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
The third component of Coke's success

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
is marketing.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Ultimately, Coke's success

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
depends on one crucial fact

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
and that is that people want

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
a Coca-Cola.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Now the reason these micro-entrepreneurs

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
can sell or make a profit

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
is they have to sell every single bottle in their pushcart or their wheelbarrow.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
So, they rely on Coca-Cola

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
in terms of its marketing,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
and what's the secret to their marketing?

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Well, it's aspirational.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
It is associated that product

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
with a kind of life that people want to live.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
So even though it's a global company,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
they take a very local approach.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Coke's global campaign slogan

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
is "Open Happiness."

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
But they localize it.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
And they don't just guess what makes people happy;

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
they go to places like Latin America

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
and they realize that happiness there

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
is associated with family life.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
And in South Africa,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
they associate happiness

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
with seriti or community respect.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Now, that played itself out in the World Cup campaign.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Let's listen to this song that Coke created for it,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
"Wavin' Flag" by a Somali hip hop artist.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
(Video) K'Naan: ♫ Oh oh oh oh oh o-oh ♫

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
♫ Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ♫

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
♫ Oh oh oh oh oh o-oh ♫

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
♫ Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh o-oh ♫

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000
♫Give you freedom, give you fire♫

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
♫ Give you reason, take you higher ♫

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
♫ You define us, make us feel proud ♫

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
♫ In the streets our heads are lifted ♫

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
♫ As we lose our inhibition ♫

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
♫ Celebration, it's around us ♫

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
♫ Every nation, all around us ♫

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Melinda French Gates: It feels pretty good, right?

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Well, they didn't stop there --

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
they localized it into 18 different languages.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
And it went number one on the pop chart

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
in 17 countries.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
It reminds me of a song that I remember from my childhood,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
"I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing,"

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
that also went number one on the pop charts.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Both songs have something in common:

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
that same appeal

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
of celebration and unity.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
So how does health and development market?

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Well, it's based on avoidance,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
not aspirations.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
I'm sure you've heard some of these messages.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
"Use a condom, don't get AIDS."

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
"Wash you hands, you might not get diarrhea."

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
It doesn't sound anything like "Wavin' Flag" to me.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
And I think we make a fundamental mistake --

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
we make an assumption,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
that we think that, if people need something,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
we don't have to make them want that.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
And I think that's a mistake.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
And there's some indications around the world that this is starting to change.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
One example is sanitation.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
We know that a million and a half children

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
die a year from diarrhea

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000
and a lot of it is because of open defecation.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
But there's a solution: you build a toilet.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
But what we're finding around the world, over and over again,

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
is, if you build a toilet and you leave it there,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
it doesn't get used.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
People reuse it for a slab for their home.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
They sometimes store grain in it.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
I've even seen it used for a chicken coop.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
(Laughter)

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
But what does marketing really entail

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
that would make a sanitation solution get a result in diarrhea?

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Well, you work with the community.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
You start to talk to them about why open defecation

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000
is something that shouldn't be done in the village,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
and they agree to that.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
But then you take the toilet and you position it

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
as a modern, trendy convenience.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
One state in Northern India has gone so far

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
as to link toilets to courtship.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
And it works -- look at these headlines.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
(Laughter)

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
I'm not kidding.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Women are refusing to marry men without toilets.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
No loo, no "I do."

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
(Laughter)

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Now, it's not just a funny headline --

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
it's innovative. It's an innovative marketing campaign.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
But more importantly,

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
it saves lives.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Take a look at this --

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
this is a room full of young men

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
and my husband, Bill.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
And can you guess what the young men are waiting for?

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
They're waiting to be circumcised.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Can you you believe that?

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
We know that circumcision reduces HIV infection

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
by 60 percent in men.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
And when we first heard this result inside the Foundation,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
I have to admit, Bill and I were scratching our heads a little bit

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
and we were saying, "But who's going to volunteer for this procedure?"

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
But it turns out the men do,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
because they're hearing from their girlfriends

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
that they prefer it,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
and the men also believe it improves their sex life.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
So if we can start to understand

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
what people really want

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
in health and development,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
we can change communities

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
and we can change whole nations.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Well, why is all of this so important?

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000
So let's talk about what happens when this all comes together,

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
when you tie the three things together.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
And polio, I think, is one of the most powerful examples.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
We've seen a 99 percent reduction in polio in 20 years.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
So if you look back to 1988,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
there are about 350,000 cases of polio

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
on the planet that year.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
In 2009, we're down to 1,600 cases.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Well how did that happen?

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Let's look at a country like India.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
They have over a billion people in this country,

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
but they have 35,000 local doctors

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
who report paralysis,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
and clinicians, a huge reporting system in chemists.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
They have two and a half million vaccinators.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
But let me make the story a little bit more concrete for you.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
Let me tell you the story of Shriram,

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
an 18 month boy in Bihar,

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
a northern state in India.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
This year on August 8th, he felt paralysis

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
and on the 13th, his parents took him to the doctor.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
On August 14th and 15th, they took a stool sample,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
and by the 25th of August,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
it was confirmed he had Type 1 polio.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
By August 30th, a genetic test was done,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
and we knew what strain of polio Shriram had.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Now it could have come from one of two places.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
It could have come from Nepal, just to the north, across the border,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
or from Jharkhand, a state just to the south.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Luckily, the genetic testing proved

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
that, in fact, this strand came north,

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
because, had it come from the south,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
it would have had a much wider impact in terms of transmission.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
So many more people would have been affected.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
So what's the endgame?

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Well on September 4th, there was a huge mop-up campaign,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
which is what you do in polio.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
They went out and where Shriram lives,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
they vaccinated two million people.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
So in less than a month,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
we went from one case of paralysis

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
to a targeted vaccination program.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
And I'm happy to say only one other person in that area got polio.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
That's how you keep

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
a huge outbreak from spreading,

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
and it shows what can happen

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
when local people have the data in their hands;

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
they can save lives.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Now one of the challenges in polio, still, is marketing,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
but it might not be what you think.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
It's not the marketing on the ground.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
It's not telling the parents,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
"If you see paralysis, take your child to the doctor

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
or get your child vaccinated."

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
We have a problem with marketing in the donor community.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
The G8 nations have been incredibly generous on polio

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
over the last 20 years,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
but we're starting to have something called polio fatigue

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
and that is that the donor nations

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
aren't willing to fund polio any longer.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
So by next summer, we're sighted to run out of money on polio.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
So we are 99 percent

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
of the way there on this goal

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
and we're about to run short of money.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
And I think that if the marketing were more aspirational,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
if we could focus as a community

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
on how far we've come

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
and how amazing it would be

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
to eradicate this disease,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
we could put polio fatigue

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
and polio behind us.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
And if we could do that,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
we could stop vaccinating everybody, worldwide,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
in all of our countries for polio.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
And it would only be the second disease ever

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
wiped off the face of the planet.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
And we are so close.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
And this victory is so possible.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
So if Coke's marketers came to me

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
and asked me to define happiness,

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
I'd say my vision of happiness

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
is a mother holding healthy baby

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
in her arms.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
To me, that is deep happiness.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
And so if we can learn lessons from the innovators in every sector,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
then in the future we make together,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
that happiness

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
can be just as ubiquitous

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
as Coca-Cola.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
Thank you.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:07.000
(Applause)
