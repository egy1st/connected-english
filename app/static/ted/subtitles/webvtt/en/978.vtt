00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I learned about the Haiti earthquake by Skype.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
My wife sent me a message,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
"Whoa, earthquake,"

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and then disappeared for 25 minutes.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It was 25 minutes of absolute terror

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
that thousands of people across the U.S. felt.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I was afraid of a tsunami;

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
what I didn't realize

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
was there was a greater terror in Haiti,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and that was building collapse.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We've all seen the photos

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
of the collapsed buildings in Haiti.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
These are shots my wife took

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
a couple days after the quake,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
while I was making my way through the D.R. into the country.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
This is the national palace --

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
the equivalent of the White House.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
This is the largest supermarket in the Caribbean

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
at peak shopping time.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
This is a nurses' college --

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
there are 300 nurses studying.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
The general hospital right next door

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
emerged largely unscathed.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
This is the Ministry of Economics and Finance.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
We have all heard

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
about the tremendous human loss

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
in the earthquake in Haiti,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
but we haven't heard enough

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
about why all those lives were lost.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
We haven't heard about

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
why the buildings failed.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
After all, it was the buildings,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
not the earthquake,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
that killed 220,000 people,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
that injured 330,000,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000
that displaced 1.3 million people,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
that cut off food

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and water and supplies

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
for an entire nation.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
This is the largest metropolitan-area disaster

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
in decades,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
and it was not a natural disaster --

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
it was a disaster of engineering.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
AIDG has worked in Haiti

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
since 2007,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
providing engineering and business support

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
to small businesses.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
And after the quake, we started bringing in earthquake engineers

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
to figure out why the buildings collapsed,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
to examine what was safe and what wasn't.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Working with MINUSTAH,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
which is the U.N. mission in Haiti,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
with the Ministry of Public Works,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
with different NGOs,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
we inspected over 1,500 buildings.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
We inspected schools

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
and private residencies.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
We inspected medical centers

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and food warehouses.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
We inspected government buildings.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
This is the Ministry of Justice.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Behind that door

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
is the National Judicial Archives.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
The fellow in the door, Andre Filitrault --

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
who's the director

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
of the Center for Interdisciplinary Earthquake Engineering Research

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
at the University of Buffalo --

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
was examining it to see if it was safe

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
to recover the archives.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Andre told me,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
after seeing these buildings fail

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
again and again in the same way,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
that there is no new research here.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
There is nothing here that we don't know.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
The failure points were the same:

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
walls and slabs not tied properly into columns --

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
that's a roof slab hanging off the building --

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
cantilevered structures,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
or structures that were asymmetric,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
that shook violently and came down,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
poor building materials,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
not enough concrete,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
not enough compression in the blocks,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
rebar that was smooth,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
rebar that was exposed to the weather and had rusted away.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Now there's a solution

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
to all these problems.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And we know how to build properly.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
The proof of this came in Chile,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000
almost a month later,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
when 8.8 magnitude earthquake

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
hit Chile.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
That is 500 times

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
the power of the 7.0

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
that hit Port-au-Prince --

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
500 times the power,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
yet only under a thousand casualties.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Adjusted for population density,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
that is less than one percent

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
of the impact of the Haitian quake.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
What was the difference

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
between Chile and Haiti?

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Seismic standards

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
and confined masonry,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
where the building acts as a whole --

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
walls and columns

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
and roofs and slabs

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
tied together to support each other --

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
instead of breaking off into separate members and failing.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
If you look at this building in Chile,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
it's ripped in half,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
but it's not a pile of rubble.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Chileans have been building with confined masonry

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
for decades.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Right now, AIDG is working with KPFF Consulting Engineers,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Architecture for Humanity,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
to bring more confined masonry training

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
into Haiti.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
This is Xantus Daniel;

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
he's a mason,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
just a general construction worker, not a foreman,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
who took one of our trainings.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
On his last job he was working with his boss,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
and they started pouring the columns wrong.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
He took his boss aside,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
and he showed him the materials on confined masonry.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
He showed him, "You know, we don't have to do this wrong.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
It won't cost us any more

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
to do it the right way."

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
And they redid that building.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
They tied the rebar right,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
they poured the columns right,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
and that building will be safe.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
And every building

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
that they build going forward

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
will be safe.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
To make sure these buildings are safe,

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000
it's not going to take policy --

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
it's going to take reaching out

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
to the masons on the ground

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
and helping them learn the proper techniques.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Now there are many groups doing this.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
And the fellow in the vest there,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Craig Toten,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
he has pushed forward

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
to get documentation out to all the groups that are doing this.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Through Haiti Rewired,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
through Build Change, Architecture for Humanity,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
AIDG,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
there is the possibility

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
to reach out

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
to 30,000 -- 40,000 masons

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
across the country

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
and create a movement of proper building.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
If you reach out to the people on the ground

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
in this collaborative way

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
it's extremely affordable.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
For the billions spent on reconstruction,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
you can train masons

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
for dollars on every house

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
that they end up building over their lifetime.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Ultimately, there are two ways

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
that you can rebuild Haiti;

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
the way at the top

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
is the way that Haiti's been building for decades.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
The way at the top

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
is a poorly constructed building

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
that will fail.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
The way at the bottom is a confined masonry building,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
where the walls are tied together,

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
the building is symmetric,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
and it will stand up to an earthquake.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
For all the disaster,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
there is an opportunity here

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
to build better houses

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
for the next generation,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
so that when the next earthquake hits,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
it is a disaster --

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
but not a tragedy.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
(Applause)
