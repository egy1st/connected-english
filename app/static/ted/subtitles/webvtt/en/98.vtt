00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.976
My title: "Queerer than we can
suppose: the strangeness of science."

00:00:06.416 --> 00:00:10.558
"Queerer than we can suppose" comes
from J.B.S. Haldane, the famous biologist,

00:00:10.582 --> 00:00:15.360
who said, "Now, my own suspicion
is that the universe is not only queerer

00:00:15.384 --> 00:00:19.443
than we suppose, but queerer
than we can suppose.

00:00:19.848 --> 00:00:22.579
I suspect that there are more things
in heaven and earth

00:00:22.603 --> 00:00:27.393
than are dreamed of, or can
be dreamed of, in any philosophy."

00:00:29.213 --> 00:00:34.028
Richard Feynman compared
the accuracy of quantum theories --

00:00:34.052 --> 00:00:35.878
experimental predictions --

00:00:35.902 --> 00:00:42.189
to specifying the width of North America
to within one hair's breadth of accuracy.

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.718
This means that quantum theory
has got to be, in some sense, true.

00:00:46.742 --> 00:00:49.677
Yet the assumptions
that quantum theory needs to make

00:00:49.701 --> 00:00:53.140
in order to deliver those
predictions are so mysterious

00:00:53.164 --> 00:00:56.918
that even Feynman himself
was moved to remark,

00:00:56.942 --> 00:00:59.781
"If you think you understand
quantum theory,

00:00:59.805 --> 00:01:02.432
you don't understand quantum theory."

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:07.076
It's so queer that physicists
resort to one or another

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.822
paradoxical interpretation of it.

00:01:10.378 --> 00:01:14.871
David Deutsch, who's talking here,
in "The Fabric of Reality,"

00:01:14.895 --> 00:01:19.976
embraces the many-worlds
interpretation of quantum theory,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.021
because the worst that you
can say about it

00:01:22.045 --> 00:01:24.298
is that it's preposterously wasteful.

00:01:24.322 --> 00:01:30.727
It postulates a vast and rapidly growing
number of universes existing in parallel,

00:01:30.751 --> 00:01:32.562
mutually undetectable,

00:01:32.586 --> 00:01:39.005
except through the narrow porthole
of quantum mechanical experiments.

00:01:40.268 --> 00:01:41.976
And that's Richard Feynman.

00:01:43.395 --> 00:01:45.769
The biologist Lewis Wolpert believes

00:01:45.793 --> 00:01:47.508
that the queerness of modern physics

00:01:47.532 --> 00:01:49.218
is just an extreme example.

00:01:49.242 --> 00:01:51.542
Science, as opposed to technology,

00:01:51.566 --> 00:01:54.239
does violence to common sense.

00:01:54.787 --> 00:01:57.890
Every time you drink a glass
of water, he points out,

00:01:57.914 --> 00:02:01.395
the odds are that you will imbibe
at least one molecule

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:04.377
that passed through the bladder
of Oliver Cromwell.

00:02:04.401 --> 00:02:06.208
(Laughter)

00:02:06.232 --> 00:02:08.459
It's just elementary probability theory.

00:02:08.483 --> 00:02:09.659
(Laughter)

00:02:09.683 --> 00:02:12.900
The number of molecules
per glassful is hugely greater

00:02:12.924 --> 00:02:16.710
than the number of glassfuls,
or bladdersful, in the world.

00:02:16.734 --> 00:02:19.944
And of course, there's nothing special
about Cromwell or bladders --

00:02:19.968 --> 00:02:22.397
you have just breathed in a nitrogen atom

00:02:22.421 --> 00:02:25.976
that passed through the right lung
of the third iguanodon

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.709
to the left of the tall cycad tree.

00:02:31.555 --> 00:02:33.878
"Queerer than we can suppose."

00:02:34.807 --> 00:02:38.326
What is it that makes us
capable of supposing anything,

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.890
and does this tell us anything
about what we can suppose?

00:02:42.724 --> 00:02:48.082
Are there things about the universe
that will be forever beyond our grasp,

00:02:48.106 --> 00:02:51.473
but not beyond the grasp
of some superior intelligence?

00:02:51.497 --> 00:02:53.186
Are there things about the universe

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.457
that are, in principle,
ungraspable by any mind,

00:02:57.481 --> 00:02:59.000
however superior?

00:03:00.422 --> 00:03:05.159
The history of science has been
one long series of violent brainstorms,

00:03:05.183 --> 00:03:08.283
as successive generations
have come to terms with

00:03:08.307 --> 00:03:11.150
increasing levels of queerness
in the universe.

00:03:11.863 --> 00:03:14.913
We're now so used to the idea
that the Earth spins,

00:03:14.937 --> 00:03:17.268
rather than the Sun moves across the sky,

00:03:17.292 --> 00:03:18.601
it's hard for us to realize

00:03:18.625 --> 00:03:22.107
what a shattering mental revolution
that must have been.

00:03:22.631 --> 00:03:25.834
After all, it seems obvious
that the Earth is large and motionless,

00:03:25.858 --> 00:03:27.637
the Sun, small and mobile.

00:03:27.661 --> 00:03:32.246
But it's worth recalling
Wittgenstein's remark on the subject:

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.249
"Tell me," he asked a friend,
"why do people always say

00:03:36.273 --> 00:03:40.348
it was natural for man to assume
that the Sun went 'round the Earth,

00:03:40.372 --> 00:03:43.031
rather than that the Earth was rotating?"

00:03:43.878 --> 00:03:45.871
And his friend replied, "Well, obviously,

00:03:45.895 --> 00:03:49.489
because it just looks as though
the Sun is going round the Earth."

00:03:50.114 --> 00:03:53.876
Wittgenstein replied, "Well,
what would it have looked like

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.412
if it had looked as though
the Earth was rotating?"

00:03:57.436 --> 00:04:01.411
(Laughter)

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.027
Science has taught us,
against all intuition,

00:04:05.051 --> 00:04:08.452
that apparently solid things,
like crystals and rocks,

00:04:08.476 --> 00:04:12.357
are really almost entirely
composed of empty space.

00:04:12.706 --> 00:04:17.001
And the familiar illustration
is the nucleus of an atom

00:04:17.025 --> 00:04:20.140
is a fly in the middle
of a sports stadium,

00:04:20.164 --> 00:04:23.191
and the next atom
is in the next sports stadium.

00:04:23.897 --> 00:04:27.084
So it would seem the hardest,
solidest, densest rock

00:04:27.108 --> 00:04:30.697
is really almost entirely empty space,

00:04:30.721 --> 00:04:35.295
broken only by tiny particles
so widely spaced they shouldn't count.

00:04:35.835 --> 00:04:39.970
Why, then, do rocks look and feel
solid and hard and impenetrable?

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:45.874
As an evolutionary biologist,
I'd say this: our brains have evolved

00:04:45.898 --> 00:04:51.976
to help us survive within the orders
of magnitude, of size and speed

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.740
which our bodies operate at.

00:04:54.185 --> 00:04:57.068
We never evolved to navigate
in the world of atoms.

00:04:57.092 --> 00:05:00.417
If we had, our brains
probably would perceive rocks

00:05:00.441 --> 00:05:01.887
as full of empty space.

00:05:01.911 --> 00:05:04.355
Rocks feel hard and impenetrable

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:08.976
to our hands, precisely because
objects like rocks and hands

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.877
cannot penetrate each other.

00:05:11.537 --> 00:05:13.329
It's therefore useful

00:05:13.353 --> 00:05:19.479
for our brains to construct notions
like "solidity" and "impenetrability,"

00:05:19.503 --> 00:05:22.976
because such notions help us
to navigate our bodies

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.247
through the middle-sized world
in which we have to navigate.

00:05:27.644 --> 00:05:29.421
Moving to the other end of the scale,

00:05:29.445 --> 00:05:32.835
our ancestors never had to navigate
through the cosmos

00:05:32.859 --> 00:05:35.223
at speeds close to the speed of light.

00:05:35.247 --> 00:05:39.853
If they had, our brains would be
much better at understanding Einstein.

00:05:40.765 --> 00:05:45.266
I want to give the name "Middle World"
to the medium-scaled environment

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:47.688
in which we've evolved
the ability to take act --

00:05:47.712 --> 00:05:49.439
nothing to do with "Middle Earth" --

00:05:49.463 --> 00:05:50.614
Middle World.

00:05:50.638 --> 00:05:51.976
(Laughter)

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.009
We are evolved denizens of Middle World,

00:05:55.033 --> 00:05:58.509
and that limits what
we are capable of imagining.

00:05:58.533 --> 00:06:01.314
We find it intuitively easy
to grasp ideas like,

00:06:01.338 --> 00:06:04.103
when a rabbit moves
at the sort of medium velocity

00:06:04.127 --> 00:06:06.976
at which rabbits and other
Middle World objects move,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.852
and hits another Middle World object
like a rock, it knocks itself out.

00:06:12.846 --> 00:06:18.608
May I introduce Major General
Albert Stubblebine III,

00:06:18.632 --> 00:06:22.965
commander of military
intelligence in 1983.

00:06:23.651 --> 00:06:28.723
"...[He] stared at his wall in Arlington,
Virginia, and decided to do it.

00:06:29.445 --> 00:06:34.304
As frightening as the prospect was,
he was going into the next office.

00:06:35.238 --> 00:06:39.008
He stood up and moved
out from behind his desk.

00:06:40.088 --> 00:06:43.920
'What is the atom mostly made of?'
he thought, 'Space.'

00:06:44.428 --> 00:06:49.594
He started walking. 'What am I
mostly made of? Atoms.'

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.498
He quickened his pace,
almost to a jog now.

00:06:53.181 --> 00:06:55.526
'What is the wall mostly made of?'

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:56.551
(Laughter)

00:06:56.575 --> 00:06:57.725
'Atoms!'

00:06:58.588 --> 00:07:01.850
All I have to do is merge the spaces.

00:07:03.056 --> 00:07:08.656
Then, General Stubblebine banged
his nose hard on the wall of his office.

00:07:09.339 --> 00:07:13.278
Stubblebine, who commanded
16,000 soldiers,

00:07:13.302 --> 00:07:17.229
was confounded by his continual failure
to walk through the wall.

00:07:17.253 --> 00:07:20.321
He has no doubt that this ability
will one day be a common tool

00:07:20.345 --> 00:07:21.972
in the military arsenal.

00:07:21.996 --> 00:07:25.811
Who would screw around with an army
that could do that?"

00:07:25.835 --> 00:07:27.804
That's from an article in Playboy,

00:07:27.828 --> 00:07:29.543
which I was reading the other day.

00:07:29.567 --> 00:07:31.174
(Laughter)

00:07:31.198 --> 00:07:33.094
I have every reason to think it's true;

00:07:33.118 --> 00:07:36.606
I was reading Playboy because I, myself,
had an article in it.

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:42.491
(Laughter)

00:07:42.515 --> 00:07:47.165
Unaided human intuition,
schooled in Middle World,

00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:50.496
finds it hard to believe Galileo
when he tells us

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.914
a heavy object and a light object,
air friction aside,

00:07:53.938 --> 00:07:55.914
would hit the ground at the same instant.

00:07:55.938 --> 00:07:59.492
And that's because in Middle World,
air friction is always there.

00:07:59.516 --> 00:08:00.865
If we'd evolved in a vacuum,

00:08:00.889 --> 00:08:03.695
we would expect them to hit
the ground simultaneously.

00:08:04.106 --> 00:08:05.619
If we were bacteria,

00:08:05.643 --> 00:08:08.958
constantly buffeted by thermal
movements of molecules,

00:08:08.982 --> 00:08:10.133
it would be different.

00:08:10.157 --> 00:08:13.435
But we Middle-Worlders are too big
to notice Brownian motion.

00:08:13.856 --> 00:08:17.206
In the same way, our lives
are dominated by gravity,

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:20.525
but are almost oblivious
to the force of surface tension.

00:08:20.851 --> 00:08:23.676
A small insect would reverse
these priorities.

00:08:25.067 --> 00:08:27.520
Steve Grand -- he's the one on the left,

00:08:27.544 --> 00:08:29.099
Douglas Adams is on the right.

00:08:29.123 --> 00:08:32.821
Steve Grand, in his book,
"Creation: Life and How to Make It,"

00:08:32.845 --> 00:08:37.648
is positively scathing about our
preoccupation with matter itself.

00:08:38.698 --> 00:08:42.337
We have this tendency to think
that only solid, material things

00:08:42.361 --> 00:08:44.242
are really things at all.

00:08:44.811 --> 00:08:49.242
Waves of electromagnetic fluctuation
in a vacuum seem unreal.

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:54.596
Victorians thought the waves
had to be waves in some material medium:

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:55.770
the ether.

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:58.747
But we find real matter comforting

00:08:58.771 --> 00:09:02.738
only because we've evolved
to survive in Middle World,

00:09:02.762 --> 00:09:05.508
where matter is a useful fiction.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.238
A whirlpool, for Steve Grand,
is a thing with just as much reality

00:09:10.262 --> 00:09:11.412
as a rock.

00:09:12.978 --> 00:09:15.628
In a desert plain in Tanzania,

00:09:15.652 --> 00:09:18.842
in the shadow of the volcano
Ol Doinyo Lengai,

00:09:18.866 --> 00:09:20.923
there's a dune made of volcanic ash.

00:09:21.651 --> 00:09:24.651
The beautiful thing
is that it moves bodily.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.207
It's what's technically known
as a "barchan,"

00:09:27.231 --> 00:09:31.435
and the entire dune walks
across the desert in a westerly direction

00:09:31.459 --> 00:09:34.459
at a speed of about 17 meters per year.

00:09:34.825 --> 00:09:39.316
It retains its crescent shape and moves
in the direction of the horns.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:43.316
What happens is that the wind blows
the sand up the shallow slope

00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:44.548
on the other side,

00:09:44.572 --> 00:09:48.317
and then, as each sand grain hits
the top of the ridge, it cascades down

00:09:48.341 --> 00:09:49.799
on the inside of the crescent,

00:09:49.823 --> 00:09:52.819
and so the whole horn-shaped dune moves.

00:09:54.803 --> 00:09:58.293
Steve Grand points out
that you and I are, ourselves,

00:09:58.317 --> 00:10:01.249
more like a wave than a permanent thing.

00:10:01.877 --> 00:10:03.728
He invites us, the reader,

00:10:03.752 --> 00:10:06.157
to think of an experience
from your childhood,

00:10:06.181 --> 00:10:07.739
something you remember clearly,

00:10:07.763 --> 00:10:10.797
something you can see,
feel, maybe even smell,

00:10:10.821 --> 00:10:12.536
as if you were really there.

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:16.333
After all, you really were there
at the time, weren't you?

00:10:16.357 --> 00:10:18.461
How else would you remember it?

00:10:18.485 --> 00:10:21.143
But here is the bombshell:
You weren't there.

00:10:21.167 --> 00:10:23.584
Not a single atom
that is in your body today

00:10:23.608 --> 00:10:26.118
was there when that event took place.

00:10:26.142 --> 00:10:28.285
Matter flows from place to place

00:10:28.309 --> 00:10:31.237
and momentarily comes together to be you.

00:10:31.261 --> 00:10:32.613
Whatever you are, therefore,

00:10:32.637 --> 00:10:36.719
you are not the stuff
of which you are made.

00:10:36.743 --> 00:10:39.791
If that doesn't make the hair stand up
on the back of your neck,

00:10:39.815 --> 00:10:43.131
read it again until it does,
because it is important.

00:10:44.283 --> 00:10:48.377
So "really" isn't a word that we should
use with simple confidence.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.272
If a neutrino had a brain,

00:10:51.296 --> 00:10:54.038
which it evolved
in neutrino-sized ancestors,

00:10:54.062 --> 00:10:58.063
it would say that rocks really
do consist of empty space.

00:10:58.833 --> 00:11:01.626
We have brains that evolved
in medium-sized ancestors

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:03.650
which couldn't walk through rocks.

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:08.650
"Really," for an animal, is whatever
its brain needs it to be

00:11:08.674 --> 00:11:10.674
in order to assist its survival.

00:11:11.075 --> 00:11:13.822
And because different species
live in different worlds,

00:11:13.846 --> 00:11:17.933
there will be a discomforting
variety of "reallys."

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:24.607
What we see of the real world
is not the unvarnished world,

00:11:24.631 --> 00:11:28.912
but a model of the world,
regulated and adjusted by sense data,

00:11:28.936 --> 00:11:32.919
but constructed so it's useful
for dealing with the real world.

00:11:33.459 --> 00:11:36.617
The nature of the model depends
on the kind of animal we are.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.633
A flying animal needs
a different kind of model

00:11:40.657 --> 00:11:43.357
from a walking, climbing
or swimming animal.

00:11:43.381 --> 00:11:47.801
A monkey's brain must have
software capable of simulating

00:11:47.825 --> 00:11:51.120
a three-dimensional world
of branches and trunks.

00:11:51.144 --> 00:11:55.521
A mole's software for constructing models
of its world will be customized

00:11:55.545 --> 00:11:57.497
for underground use.

00:11:57.521 --> 00:12:01.388
A water strider's brain
doesn't need 3D software at all,

00:12:01.412 --> 00:12:03.562
since it lives on the surface of the pond,

00:12:03.586 --> 00:12:05.906
in an Edwin Abbott flatland.

00:12:07.652 --> 00:12:11.681
I've speculated that bats may see
color with their ears.

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:15.584
The world model that a bat needs
in order to navigate

00:12:15.608 --> 00:12:17.585
through three dimensions catching insects

00:12:17.609 --> 00:12:20.682
must be pretty similar to the world
model that any flying bird --

00:12:20.706 --> 00:12:24.584
a day-flying bird like a swallow --
needs to perform the same kind of tasks.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.290
The fact that the bat uses
echoes in pitch darkness

00:12:28.314 --> 00:12:31.081
to input the current
variables to its model,

00:12:31.105 --> 00:12:33.874
while the swallow uses
light, is incidental.

00:12:34.456 --> 00:12:39.734
Bats, I've even suggested, use
perceived hues, such as red and blue,

00:12:39.758 --> 00:12:45.873
as labels, internal labels,
for some useful aspect of echoes --

00:12:45.897 --> 00:12:50.444
perhaps the acoustic texture of surfaces,
furry or smooth and so on --

00:12:50.468 --> 00:12:55.031
in the same way as swallows or indeed,
we, use those perceived hues --

00:12:55.055 --> 00:12:56.659
redness and blueness, etc. --

00:12:56.683 --> 00:12:59.555
to label long and short
wavelengths of light.

00:12:59.579 --> 00:13:02.906
There's nothing inherent about red
that makes it long wavelength.

00:13:03.747 --> 00:13:07.971
The point is that the nature of the model
is governed by how it is to be used,

00:13:07.995 --> 00:13:11.882
rather than by the sensory
modality involved.

00:13:12.871 --> 00:13:15.691
J.B.S. Haldane himself had
something to say about animals

00:13:15.715 --> 00:13:18.000
whose world is dominated by smell.

00:13:18.535 --> 00:13:24.369
Dogs can distinguish two very similar
fatty acids, extremely diluted:

00:13:24.393 --> 00:13:27.077
caprylic acid and caproic acid.

00:13:27.101 --> 00:13:28.499
The only difference, you see,

00:13:28.523 --> 00:13:31.807
is that one has an extra pair
of carbon atoms in the chain.

00:13:31.831 --> 00:13:36.319
Haldane guesses that a dog would probably
be able to place the acids

00:13:36.343 --> 00:13:39.787
in the order of their molecular
weights by their smells,

00:13:39.811 --> 00:13:42.933
just as a man could place
a number of piano wires

00:13:42.957 --> 00:13:46.162
in the order of their lengths
by means of their notes.

00:13:46.726 --> 00:13:50.513
Now, there's another
fatty acid, capric acid,

00:13:50.537 --> 00:13:52.149
which is just like the other two,

00:13:52.173 --> 00:13:54.727
except that it has two more carbon atoms.

00:13:55.481 --> 00:13:58.304
A dog that had never met
capric acid would, perhaps,

00:13:58.328 --> 00:14:01.281
have no more trouble imagining its smell

00:14:01.305 --> 00:14:04.461
than we would have trouble
imagining a trumpet, say,

00:14:04.485 --> 00:14:08.875
playing one note higher than we've heard
a trumpet play before.

00:14:11.549 --> 00:14:17.831
Perhaps dogs and rhinos and other
smell-oriented animals smell in color.

00:14:18.268 --> 00:14:21.133
And the argument would be exactly
the same as for the bats.

00:14:23.253 --> 00:14:26.940
Middle World -- the range
of sizes and speeds

00:14:26.964 --> 00:14:30.552
which we have evolved to feel
intuitively comfortable with --

00:14:30.576 --> 00:14:34.344
is a bit like the narrow range
of the electromagnetic spectrum

00:14:34.368 --> 00:14:37.196
that we see as light of various colors.

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:39.540
We're blind to all
frequencies outside that,

00:14:39.564 --> 00:14:42.068
unless we use instruments to help us.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.142
Middle World is the narrow
range of reality

00:14:47.166 --> 00:14:50.420
which we judge to be normal,
as opposed to the queerness

00:14:50.444 --> 00:14:54.004
of the very small, the very large
and the very fast.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.849
We could make a similar
scale of improbabilities;

00:14:57.873 --> 00:15:00.484
nothing is totally impossible.

00:15:00.508 --> 00:15:03.769
Miracles are just events
that are extremely improbable.

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:07.059
A marble statue could wave its hand at us;

00:15:07.083 --> 00:15:09.946
the atoms that make up
its crystalline structure

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:12.187
are all vibrating back and forth anyway.

00:15:12.211 --> 00:15:13.869
Because there are so many of them,

00:15:13.893 --> 00:15:15.976
and because there's no
agreement among them

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.076
in their preferred direction of movement,

00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:22.165
the marble, as we see it
in Middle World, stays rock steady.

00:15:22.189 --> 00:15:24.799
But the atoms in the hand
could all just happen to move

00:15:24.823 --> 00:15:27.447
the same way at the same time,
and again and again.

00:15:27.471 --> 00:15:29.120
In this case, the hand would move,

00:15:29.144 --> 00:15:32.927
and we'd see it waving at us
in Middle World.

00:15:32.951 --> 00:15:35.537
The odds against it,
of course, are so great

00:15:35.561 --> 00:15:40.041
that if you set out writing zeros
at the time of the origin of the universe,

00:15:40.065 --> 00:15:43.080
you still would not have written
enough zeros to this day.

00:15:44.206 --> 00:15:47.234
Evolution in Middle World
has not equipped us

00:15:47.258 --> 00:15:50.885
to handle very improbable events;
we don't live long enough.

00:15:51.497 --> 00:15:56.188
In the vastness of astronomical space
and geological time,

00:15:56.212 --> 00:15:59.010
that which seems impossible
in Middle World

00:15:59.034 --> 00:16:01.283
might turn out to be inevitable.

00:16:03.135 --> 00:16:06.700
One way to think about that
is by counting planets.

00:16:06.724 --> 00:16:09.406
We don't know how many planets
there are in the universe,

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:12.881
but a good estimate is about 10 to the 20,
or 100 billion billion.

00:16:13.374 --> 00:16:18.323
And that gives us a nice way to express
our estimate of life's improbability.

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:23.403
We could make some sort of landmark points
along a spectrum of improbability,

00:16:23.427 --> 00:16:27.703
which might look like the electromagnetic
spectrum we just looked at.

00:16:28.568 --> 00:16:31.409
If life has arisen only once on any --

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:38.073
life could originate once per planet,
could be extremely common

00:16:38.097 --> 00:16:40.661
or it could originate once per star

00:16:40.685 --> 00:16:45.677
or once per galaxy or maybe only
once in the entire universe,

00:16:45.701 --> 00:16:47.886
in which case it would have to be here.

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:49.961
And somewhere up there would be the chance

00:16:49.985 --> 00:16:51.786
that a frog would turn into a prince,

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:54.691
and similar magical things like that.

00:16:55.207 --> 00:16:59.075
If life has arisen on only one planet
in the entire universe,

00:16:59.099 --> 00:17:03.095
that planet has to be our planet,
because here we are talking about it.

00:17:03.119 --> 00:17:05.771
And that means that if we want
to avail ourselves of it,

00:17:05.795 --> 00:17:09.632
we're allowed to postulate chemical events
in the origin of life

00:17:09.656 --> 00:17:13.536
which have a probability as low
as one in 100 billion billion.

00:17:14.036 --> 00:17:16.669
I don't think we shall have
to avail ourselves of that,

00:17:16.693 --> 00:17:19.660
because I suspect that life
is quite common in the universe.

00:17:19.684 --> 00:17:22.722
And when I say quite common,
it could still be so rare

00:17:22.746 --> 00:17:26.871
that no one island of life
ever encounters another,

00:17:26.895 --> 00:17:28.475
which is a sad thought.

00:17:29.665 --> 00:17:32.928
How shall we interpret
"queerer than we can suppose?"

00:17:33.397 --> 00:17:35.652
Queerer than can in principle be supposed,

00:17:35.676 --> 00:17:39.114
or just queerer than we can suppose,
given the limitations

00:17:39.138 --> 00:17:43.400
of our brain's evolutionary
apprenticeship in Middle World?

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.854
Could we, by training and practice,

00:17:45.878 --> 00:17:48.068
emancipate ourselves from Middle World

00:17:48.092 --> 00:17:52.735
and achieve some sort of intuitive
as well as mathematical understanding

00:17:52.759 --> 00:17:54.898
of the very small and the very large?

00:17:54.922 --> 00:17:57.034
I genuinely don't know the answer.

00:17:57.058 --> 00:18:00.692
I wonder whether we might help ourselves
to understand, say, quantum theory,

00:18:00.716 --> 00:18:03.976
if we brought up children
to play computer games

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.582
beginning in early childhood,

00:18:05.606 --> 00:18:09.527
which had a make-believe world of balls
going through two slits on a screen,

00:18:09.551 --> 00:18:13.539
a world in which the strange goings-on
of quantum mechanics were enlarged

00:18:13.563 --> 00:18:15.457
by the computer's make-believe,

00:18:15.481 --> 00:18:19.326
so that they became familiar
on the Middle-World scale of the stream.

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:21.904
And similarly, a relativistic
computer game,

00:18:21.928 --> 00:18:27.244
in which objects on the screen manifest
the Lorentz contraction, and so on,

00:18:27.268 --> 00:18:31.692
to try to get ourselves -- to get children
into the way of thinking about it.

00:18:32.124 --> 00:18:36.005
I want to end by applying
the idea of Middle World

00:18:36.029 --> 00:18:38.000
to our perceptions of each other.

00:18:38.735 --> 00:18:43.022
Most scientists today subscribe
to a mechanistic view of the mind:

00:18:43.046 --> 00:18:46.450
we're the way we are because our brains
are wired up as they are,

00:18:46.474 --> 00:18:48.126
our hormones are the way they are.

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:50.661
We'd be different, our characters
would be different,

00:18:50.685 --> 00:18:54.548
if our neuro-anatomy and our
physiological chemistry were different.

00:18:54.868 --> 00:18:56.884
But we scientists are inconsistent.

00:18:57.424 --> 00:18:58.805
If we were consistent,

00:18:58.829 --> 00:19:02.142
our response to a misbehaving
person, like a child-murderer,

00:19:02.166 --> 00:19:03.500
should be something like:

00:19:03.524 --> 00:19:06.770
this unit has a faulty component;
it needs repairing.

00:19:06.794 --> 00:19:07.976
That's not what we say.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.163
What we say -- and I include
the most austerely mechanistic among us,

00:19:12.187 --> 00:19:13.401
which is probably me --

00:19:13.425 --> 00:19:17.235
what we say is, "Vile monster,
prison is too good for you."

00:19:17.259 --> 00:19:20.976
Or worse, we seek revenge,
in all probability thereby triggering

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.570
the next phase in an escalating
cycle of counter-revenge,

00:19:24.594 --> 00:19:27.052
which we see, of course,
all over the world today.

00:19:27.496 --> 00:19:29.772
In short, when we're
thinking like academics,

00:19:29.796 --> 00:19:33.095
we regard people as elaborate
and complicated machines,

00:19:33.119 --> 00:19:35.264
like computers or cars.

00:19:35.663 --> 00:19:37.677
But when we revert to being human,

00:19:37.701 --> 00:19:41.412
we behave more like Basil Fawlty,
who, we remember,

00:19:41.436 --> 00:19:43.275
thrashed his car to teach it a lesson,

00:19:43.299 --> 00:19:45.574
when it wouldn't start on "Gourmet Night."

00:19:45.598 --> 00:19:46.951
(Laughter)

00:19:47.308 --> 00:19:51.292
The reason we personify things
like cars and computers

00:19:51.316 --> 00:19:54.684
is that just as monkeys live
in an arboreal world

00:19:54.708 --> 00:19:57.370
and moles live in an underground world

00:19:57.394 --> 00:20:01.208
and water striders live in a surface
tension-dominated flatland,

00:20:01.232 --> 00:20:03.361
we live in a social world.

00:20:03.385 --> 00:20:05.571
We swim through a sea of people --

00:20:05.595 --> 00:20:07.928
a social version of Middle World.

00:20:08.562 --> 00:20:12.277
We are evolved to second-guess
the behavior of others

00:20:12.301 --> 00:20:16.028
by becoming brilliant,
intuitive psychologists.

00:20:16.464 --> 00:20:17.856
Treating people as machines

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:21.395
may be scientifically
and philosophically accurate,

00:20:21.419 --> 00:20:23.332
but it's a cumbersome waste of time

00:20:23.356 --> 00:20:26.517
if you want to guess what this person
is going to do next.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.976
The economically useful way
to model a person

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.611
is to treat him as a purposeful,
goal-seeking agent

00:20:33.635 --> 00:20:36.051
with pleasures and pains,
desires and intentions,

00:20:36.075 --> 00:20:37.757
guilt, blame-worthiness.

00:20:38.456 --> 00:20:42.566
Personification and the imputing
of intentional purpose

00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:46.233
is such a brilliantly successful
way to model humans,

00:20:46.257 --> 00:20:49.378
it's hardly surprising
the same modeling software

00:20:49.402 --> 00:20:52.976
often seizes control when we're
trying to think about entities

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.371
for which it's not appropriate,
like Basil Fawlty with his car

00:20:56.395 --> 00:21:01.336
or like millions of deluded people,
with the universe as a whole.

00:21:01.717 --> 00:21:03.976
(Laughter)

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.141
If the universe is queerer
than we can suppose,

00:21:07.165 --> 00:21:09.667
is it just because
we've been naturally selected

00:21:09.691 --> 00:21:12.660
to suppose only what we needed to suppose

00:21:12.684 --> 00:21:15.000
in order to survive
in the Pleistocene of Africa?

00:21:15.863 --> 00:21:21.563
Or are our brains so versatile
and expandable that we can train ourselves

00:21:21.587 --> 00:21:24.242
to break out of the box of our evolution?

00:21:24.909 --> 00:21:29.322
Or finally, are there some things
in the universe so queer

00:21:29.346 --> 00:21:35.213
that no philosophy of beings,
however godlike, could dream them?
