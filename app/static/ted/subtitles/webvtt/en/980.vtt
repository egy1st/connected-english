WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I was informed by this kind of

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
unoriginal and trite idea

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
that new technologies were an opportunity

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
for social transformation,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
which is what drove me then,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and still, it's a delusion that drives me now.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I wanted to update what I've been doing since then --

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
but it's still the same theme song --

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and introduce you to my lab and current work,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
which is the Environmental Health Clinic

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
that I run at NYU.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And what it is -- it's a twist on health.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Because, really, what I'm trying to do now

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
is redefine what counts as health.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
It's a clinic like a health clinic at any other university,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
except people come to the clinic

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
with environmental health concerns,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and they walk out with prescriptions

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
for things they can do to improve environmental health,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
as opposed to coming to a clinic with medical concerns

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and walking out with prescriptions for pharmaceuticals.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
It's a handy-dandy quote from Hippocrates of the Hippocratic oath

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
that says, "The greater part of the soul lays outside the body,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
treatment of the inner requires treatment of the outer."

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
But that suggests the issue

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
that I'm trying to get at here,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
that we have an opportunity to redefine what is health.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Because this idea that health is internal

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and atomized and individual

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and pharmaceutical

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
is largely an error.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And I would use this study,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
a recent study by Philip Landrigan,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
to motivate a different view of health,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
where he went to most of the pediatricians in Manhattan

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and the New York area

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
and logged what they spent their patient hours on.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
80 to 90 percent of their time

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
was spent on five things.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Number one was asthma,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
number two was developmental delays,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
number three was 400-fold increases

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
in rare childhood cancers

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
in the last eight to 10, 15 years.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Number four and five were childhood obesity

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and diabetes-related issues.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So all of those -- what's common about all of those?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
The environment is implicated, radically implicated, right.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
This is not the germs

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
that medicos were trained to deal with;

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
this is a different definition of health,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
health that has a great advantage

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
because it's external, it's shared,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
we can do something about it,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
as opposed to internal, genetically predetermined

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
or individualized.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
People who come to the clinic are called, not patients,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
but impatients,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
because they're too impatient to wait for legislative change

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
to address local and environmental health issues.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And I meet them at the University, I also have a few field offices

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
that I set up in various places

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
that provide an immersion

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
in some of the environmental challenges we face.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
I like this one from the Belgian field office,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
where we met in a roundabout,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
precisely because the roundabout iconified

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
the headless social movement

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
that informs much social transformation,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
as opposed to the top-down control

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
of red light traffic intersections.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
In this case, of course, the roundabout

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
with that micro-decisions being made in situ

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
by people not being told what to do.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
But, of course, affords greater throughput,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
fewer accidents,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
and an interesting model of social movement.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Some of the things that the monitoring protocols have developed:

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
this is the tadpole bureaucrat protocol,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
or keeping tabs, if you will.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
What they are is an addition of tadpoles

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
that are named after a local bureaucrat

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
whose decisions affect your water quality.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
So an impatient concerned for water quality

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
would raise a tadpole bureaucrat

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
in a sample of water in which they're interested.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And we give them a couple of things to do that,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
to help them do companion animal devices

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
while they're blogging and doing their email.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
This is a tadpole walker

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
to take your tadpole walking in the evening.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
And the interesting thing that happens --

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
because we're using tadpoles, of course,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
because they have the most exquisite biosenses that we have,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
several orders of magnitude more sensitive

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
than some of our senses

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
for sensing,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
responding in a biologically meaningful way,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
to that whole class of industrial contaminants

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
we call endocrine disruptors

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
or hormone emulators.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
But by taking your tadpole out for a walk in the evening --

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
there's a few action shots --

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
your neighbors are likely to say, "What are you doing?"

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
And then you have to introduce your tadpole

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
and who it's named after.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
You have to explain what you're doing

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
and how the developmental events of a tadpole

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
are, of course, very observable

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
and they use the same T3-mediated hormones that we do.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
And so next time your neighbor sees you

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
they'll say, "How is that tadpole doing?"

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
And you can let them social network with your tadpole,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
because the Environmental Health Clinic has a social networking site

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
for, not only impatients, humans,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
but non-humans,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
social networking for humans and non-humans.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
And of course, these endocrine disruptors

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
are things that are implicated in the breast cancer epidemic,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
the obesity epidemic,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
the two and a half year drop in the average age of onset of puberty in young girls

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
and other related things.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
The culmination of this is if you've successfully raised your tadpole,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
observing the behavioral

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
and developmental events,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
you will then go and introduce your tadpole

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
to its namesake

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
and discuss the evidence that you've seen.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Another quick protocol -- and I'm going to go through these quickly,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
but just to give you the material sense of what we're doing here --

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
instead of asking you for urine samples,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
I'll ask you for a mouse sample.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Anyone here lucky enough to share, to cohabit with a mouse --

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
a domestic partnership with mice?

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Very lucky.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Mice, of course, are the quintessential

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
model organism.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000
They're even better models of environmental health,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
because not only the same mammalian biology,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
but they share your diet, largely.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
They share your environmental stressors,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
the asbestos levels and lead levels,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
whatever you're exposed to.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
And they're geographically more limited than you are,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
because we don't know if you've been exposed

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
to persistent organic pollutants

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
in your home, or occupationally

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
or as a child.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Mice are a very good representation.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
So it starts by building a better mousetrap, of course.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
This is one of them.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Coping with environmental stressors is tricky.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Is anybody here on antidepressants?

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
(Laughter)

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
There's a lot of people in Manhattan are.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
And we were testing if the mice

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
would also self-administer SSRIs.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
So this was Prozac, this was Zoloft,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
this was a black jellybean and this was muscle relaxant,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
all of which were the medications that the impatient was taking.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
So do you think the mice

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
self-administered antidepressants?

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
What's the -- (Audience: Sure. Yes.)

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
How did you know that? They did.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
This was vodka and solution, gin and solution.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
This guy also liked plain water and the muscle relaxant.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Where's our expert?

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Vodka, gin --

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
(Audience: [unclear])

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Yes. Yes. You know your mice well.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
They did, yes.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000
So they drank as much vodka as they did plain water,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
which was interesting.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Then of course, it goes into the entrapment device.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
There's an old cellphone in there -- a good use for old cellphones --

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
which dials the clinic, we go and pick up the mouse.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
We take the blood sample

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
and do the blood work and hair work on the mice.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
And I want to sort of point out the big advantage

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
of framing health in this external way.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
But we do have a few prescription products through this.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
It's very different from the medical model.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Anything you do to improve your water quality or air quality,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
or to understand it or to change it,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
the benefits are enjoyed by anyone

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
you share that water quality or air quality with.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
And that aggregating effect,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
that collective action effect,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
is actually something we can use to our advantage.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
So I want to show you one prescription product in the clinic

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
called the No Park.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
This is a prescription to improve water quality.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Many impatients are very concerned for water quality and air quality.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
What we do is we take a fire hydrant,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
a "no parking" space associated with a fire hydrant,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
and we prescribe the removal of the asphalt

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
to create an engineered micro landscape,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
to create an infiltration opportunity.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Because, many of you will know,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
that the biggest pollution burden

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
that we have on the New York, New Jersey harbor right now

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
is no longer the point sources,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
no longer the big polluters,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
no longer the GEs,

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
but that massive network of roads,

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
[those] impervious surfaces,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
that collect all that cadmium neurotoxin that comes from your brake liners

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
or the oily hydrocarbon waste

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
in every single storm event and medieval infrastructure

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
washes it straight into the estuary system.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
That doesn't do a lot of good.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
These are little opportunities to intercept those pollutants

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
before they enter the harbor,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
and they're produced by impatients

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
on various city blocks

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
in some very interesting ways.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
I just want to say it was sort of a rule of thumb though,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
there's about two or three fire hydrants

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
on every city block.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
By creating engineered micro landscapes to infiltrate in them,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
we don't prevent them from being used

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
as emergency vehicle parking spaces,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
because, of course, a firetruck can come and park there.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
They flatten a few plants. No big deal, they'll regenerate.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
But if we did this

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
in every single --

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
every fire hydrant

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
we could redefine the emergency.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
That 99 percent of the time

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
when a firetruck is not parking there,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
it's infiltrating pollutants.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
It's also increasing fixing CO2s,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
sequestering some of the airborne pollutants.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
And aggregated,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
these smaller interceptions

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
could actually infiltrate all the roadborne pollution

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
that now runs into the estuary system,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
up to a seven inch rain event, up to a hundred-year storm.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
So these are small actions

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
that can amount to a significant effect

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
to improve local environmental health.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
This is one of the more ambitious ones.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
What the climate crisis has revealed to us

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
is a secondary, more insidious

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
and more pervasive crisis,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
which is the crisis of agency,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
which is what to do.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Somehow buying a local lettuce, changing a light bulb,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
driving the speed limit, changing your tires regularly,

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
doesn't seem sufficient

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
in the face of climate crisis.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
And this is an interesting icon that happened --

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
you remember these: fallout shelters.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
What is the fallout shelter

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
for the climate crisis?

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
This was civic mobilization.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Churches, school groups,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
hospitals, private residents --

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
everyone built one of these in a matter of months.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
And they still remain

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
as icons of civic response

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
in the face of shared, uncertain, collective threat.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Fallout shelter for the climate crisis,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
I would say, looks something like this, or this,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
which is an intensive urban agriculture facility

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
that's due to go on my lab building at NYU.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
What it does

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000
is a very simple idea

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
of taking --

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
80 to 90 percent of the CO2 produced in Manhattan

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
is building related --

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
we take, just like a commercial greenhouse,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
we take the CO2 from the building --

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
CO2-enriched air --

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
we force it through the urban agriculture facility,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
and then we resupply oxygen-enriched air.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
You can't actually build much on a roof, they're not designed for that.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
So it's on legs,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
so it focuses all the load on the masonry walls and the columns.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
It's built as a barn raising,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
using open source hardware.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
This is the quarter-scale prototype

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
that was functioning in Spain.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
This is what it will look like, fingers crossed,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
NYU willing.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
And what I want to show you is --

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
actually this is one of the components of it that we've just recently been testing --

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
which is a solar chimney --

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
we have got 17 of them now put around New York at the moment --

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
that passively draws air up.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
You understand a solar chimney.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Hot air rises.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
You put a bit of black plastic on the side of a building,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
it'll heat up, and you'll get passive airflow.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
What we do is actually

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
put a standard HVAC filter on the top of that.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
That actually removes about 95 percent

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
of the carbon black,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
that stuff that, with ozone,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
is responsible for about half of global warming's effects,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
because it changes, it settles on the snow,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
it changes the reflectors,

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
it changes

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
the transmission qualities of the atmosphere.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Carbon black is that grime

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
that otherwise lodges in your pretty pink lungs,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
and it's associated with.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
It's not good stuff, and it's from inefficient combustion,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
not from combustion itself.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
When we put it through our solar chimney,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
we remove actually about 95 percent of that.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
And then I swap it out

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
with the students

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
and actually re-release that carbon black.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000
And we make pencils the length of which measures the grime

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
that we've pulled out of the air.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Here's one of them that we have up now.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Here's who put them up and who are avid pencil users.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Okay, so I want to show you

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
just two more interfaces,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
because I think one of our big challenges

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000
is re-imagining our relationship to natural systems,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
not only through this model

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
of twisted personalized health,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
but through the animals

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
with whom we cohabit.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
We are not alone; the animals are moving in.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
In fact, urban migration now describes

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
the movement of animals formerly known as wild

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
into urban centers.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
You know, coyote in Central Park, a whale in the Gowanus Canal,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
elk in Westchester County.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
It's happening all over the Developed World,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
probably for loss of habitat,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
but also because our cities are a little bit more livable

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
than they have been.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
And every green space we create

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
is an invitation for non-humans to cohabit with us.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
But we've kind of lacked imagination

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
in how we could do that well or interestingly.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
And I want to show you a few of the technological interfaces

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
that have been developed under the moniker of OOZ --

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
which is zoo backwards and without cages --

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
to try and reform

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
that relationship.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
This is communication technology for birds. It looks like this.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
When a bird lands on it, they trigger a sound file.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
This is actually in the Whitney Museum, where there were six of them,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
each of which had a different argument on it,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
different sound file.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
They said things like this.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
(Whistling)

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Recorded Voice: Here's what you need to do.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Go down there and buy some of those health food bars,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
the ones you call bird food,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
and bring it here and scatter it around.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
There's a good person.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Natalie Jeremijenko: Okay. (Laugher)

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
So there was several of these.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
The birds were able to jump from one to the other.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
These are just your average urban pigeon.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
And an early test

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
which argument elicited cooperative behavior

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
from the people below --

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
about a hundred to one

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
decided that this was the argument

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
that worked best on us.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Recorded Voice: Tick, tick, tick.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
That's the sound of genetic mutations

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
of the avian flu

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
becoming a deadly human flu.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Do you know what slows it down?

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Healthy sub-populations of birds,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
increasing biodiversity generally.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
It is in your interests that I'm healthy,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
happy, well-fed.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Hence, you could share some of your nutritional resources

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
instead of monopolizing them.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000
That is, share your lunch.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
(Laughter)

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
NJ: It worked, and it's true.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
The final project I'd like to show you

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
is a new interface for fish

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
that has just been launched --

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
it's actually officially launched next week --

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
with a wonderful commission from the Architectural League.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
You may not have known that you need to communicate with fish,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
but there is now a device for you to do so.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
It looks like this: buoys that float on the water,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
project three foot up, three foot down.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000
When a fish swims underneath, a light goes on.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
This is what it looks like.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
So there's another function on here.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
This top light is -- I'm sorry if I'm making you seasick --

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
this top light is actually a water quality display

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
that shifts from red, when the dissolved oxygen is low,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
to a blue/green, when its dissolved oxygen is high.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
And then you can also text the fish.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
So there's business cards down there

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
that'll give you contact details.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000
And they text back.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
When the buoys get your text, they wink at you twice to say, we've got your message.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
But perhaps the most popular has been

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
that we've got another array of these boys in the Bronx River,

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
where the first beaver --

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
crazy as he is --

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
to have moved in and built a lodge in New York

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
in 250 years, hangs out.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
So updates from a beaver.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
You can subscribe to updates from him. You can talk to him.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
And what I like to think of

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
is this is an interface

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
that re-scripts how we interact with natural systems,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
specifically by changing who has information,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
where they have it,

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
who can make sense of that information,

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
and what you can do about it.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
In this case, instead of throwing chewing gum,

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
or Doritos or whatever you have in your pocket at the fish --

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
There's a body of water in Iceland that I've been dealing with

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
that's in the middle of the city,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
and the largest pollution burden on it

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
is not the roadborne pollution,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
it's actually white bread

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
from people feeding the fish and the birds.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Instead of doing that actually, we've developed some fish sticks

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
that you can feed the fish.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000
They're delicious.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000
They're cross-species delicious that is,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
delicious for humans and non-humans.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
But they also have a chelating agent in them.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
They're nutritionally appropriate,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
not like Doritos.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
And so every time

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000
that desire to interact with the animals,

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
which is at least as ubiquitous

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
as that sign: "Do not feed the animals."

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
And there's about three of them on every New York City park.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
And Yellowstone National Park,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
there's more "do not feed the animals" signs

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
than there are animals you might wish to feed.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
But in that action, that interaction,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
by re-scripting that,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
by changing it into an opportunity

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000
to offer food that is nutritionally appropriate,

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
that could augment the nutritional resources

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
that we ourselves have depleted

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
for augmenting the fish population

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
and also adding chelating agent,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000
which, like any chelating agent that we use medicinally,

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
binds to the bioaccumulated heavy metals and PCBs

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
that are in the fish

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
living in this particular habitat

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
and allows them to pass it out as a harmless salt

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
where it's complexed by a reactive,

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
effectively removing it from bioavailability.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
But I wanted to say that interaction,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
re-scripting that interaction,

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
into collective action, collective remediative action,

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
very different from the approach

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
that's being used on the other side on the Hudson River,

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
where we're dredging the PCBs --

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000
after 30 years of legislative and legal struggle,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
GE's paying for the dredging

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
of the largest Superfund site in the world --

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000
we're dredging it, and it'll probably get shipped off to Pennsylvania

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
or the nearest Third World country,

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
where it will continue to be toxic sludge.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Displacement is not the way to deal with environmental issues.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
And that's typically the paradigm

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000
under which we've operated.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
By actually taking the opportunity

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
that new technologies,

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
new interactive technologies, present

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
to re-script our interactions,

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
to script them,

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000
not just as isolated, individuated interactions,

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000
but as collective aggregating actions

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
that can amount to something,

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
we can really begin to address

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
some of our important environmental challenges.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
Thank you.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.000
