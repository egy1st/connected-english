WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Every presentation needs this slide in it.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
(Laughter)

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
It's beautiful, isn't it?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Do you see?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
All the points, all the lines --

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
it's incredible.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
It is the network;

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and in my case, the network has been important in media,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
because I get to connect to people.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Isn't it amazing?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Through that, I connect to people.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
And the way that I've been doing it

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
has been multifaceted.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
For example, I get people to dress up their vacuum cleaners.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
(Laughter)

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I put together projects like Earth Sandwich,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
where I ask people

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
to try and simultaneously place

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
two pieces of bread

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
perfectly opposite each other on the Earth.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
And people started laying bread in tribute,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and eventually a team was able to do it

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
between New Zealand and Spain.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
It's pretty incredible -- the video's online.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Connecting to people in projects

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
like YoungmeNowme for example.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
In YoungmeNowme, the audience was asked

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
to find a childhood photograph of themselves

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and restage it as an adult.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:22.000
(Laughter)

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
This is the same person --

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
top photo, James, bottom photo, [Jennifer].

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Poignant.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
This was a Mother's Day gift.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
(Laughter)

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Particularly creepy.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
(Applause)

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
(Laughter)

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
My favorite of these photos, which I couldn't find,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
is there's a picture of a 30 year-old woman or so

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
with a little baby on her lap,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and the next photo is a 220-lb man

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
with a tiny, little old lady peaking over his shoulder.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
But this project changed the way

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
that I thought about connecting to people.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
This is project called Ray.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And what happened was I was sent this piece of audio

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and had no idea who generated the audio.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Somebody said, "You have to listen to this."

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
And this is what came to me.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Recording: Hi, my name is Ray,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and on yesterday my daughter called me

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
because she was stressed out

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
because of things that were going on on her job

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
that she felt was quite unfair.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Being quite disturbed, she called for comfort,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
and I didn't really know what to tell her,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
because we have to deal with so much mess in our society.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
So I was led to write this song just for her,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
just to give her some encouragement

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
while dealing with stress and pressures on her job.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And I figured I'd put it on the Internet

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
for all employees under stress

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
to help you better deal with what you're going through on your job.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Here's how the song goes.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000
♫ I'm about to whip somebody's ass ♫

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.000
♫ Oh, I'm about to whip somebody's ass ♫

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
♫ Oh, if you don't leave me alone, ♫

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
♫ you gonna have to send me home ♫

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
♫ 'Cause I'm about to whip somebody's ass ♫

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Now you might not be able to sing that out loud,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
but you can hum it to yourself, and you know what the words are.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And let it give you some strength to get the next few moments on your job.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
All right. Stay strong. Peace.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Ze Frank: So -- yeah.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
No, no, no, shush. We've got to go quickly.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
So I was so moved by this --

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
this is incredible. This was connecting, right.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
This was, at a distance,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
realizing that someone was feeling something,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
wanting to affect them in a particular way,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
using media to do it, putting it online

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
and realizing that there was a greater impact.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
This was incredible; this is what I wanted to do.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
So the first thing I thought of is we have to thank him.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And I asked my audience, I said, "Listen to this piece of audio.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
We have to remix it. He's got a great voice.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
It's actually in the key of B flat.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
And have to do something with it."

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
Hundreds of remixes came back -- lots of different attempts.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
One stood out in particular.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
It was done by a guy named Goose.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Remix: ♫ I'm about to whip somebody's ass ♫

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:20.000
♫ Oh, I'm about to whip somebody's ass ♫

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
♫ Oh, if you don't leave me alone, ♫

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
♫ You gonna have to send me home ♫

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000
♫ Cuz I'm about to whip somebody's ass ♫

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
♫ I'm about to whip some ♫ --

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
ZF: Great, so it was incredible.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
That song -- (Applause) Thank you.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
So that song, somebody told me that it was at a baseball game

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
in Kansas City.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
In the end,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
it was one of the top downloads

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
on a whole bunch of music streaming services.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
And so I said, "Let's put this together in an album."

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
And the audience came together, and they designed an album cover.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
And I said, "If you put it all on this, I'm going to deliver it to him,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
if you can figure out who this person is,"

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
because all I had was his name -- Ray --

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000
and this little piece of audio

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
and the fact that his daughter was upset.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
In two weeks, they found him.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
I received and email and it said,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
"Hi, I'm Ray.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
I heard you were looking for me."

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
(Laughter)

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And I was like, "Yeah, Ray.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
It's been an interesting two weeks."

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And so I flew to St. Louis

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
and met Ray,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
and he's a preacher --

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
(Laughter)

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
among other things.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
So but anyways, here's the thing --

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
is it reminds me of this,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
which is a sign that you see in Amsterdam on every street corner.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
And it's sort of a metaphor for me for the virtual world.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
I look at this photo, and he seems really interested

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
in what's going on with that button,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
but it doesn't seem like he is really that interested in crossing the street.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
(Laughter)

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000
And it makes me think of this.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
On street corners everywhere, people are looking at their cell phones,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
and it's easy to dismiss this

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
as some sort of bad trend

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
in human culture.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
But the truth is

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
life is being lived there.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
When they smile --

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
right, you've seen people stop --

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
all of a sudden, life is being lived there,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
somewhere up in that weird, dense network.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
And this is it, right, to feel and be felt.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
It's the fundamental force

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
that we're all after.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
We can build all sorts of environments

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
to make it a little bit easier,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
but ultimately, what we're trying to do

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
is really connect with one other person.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And that's not always going to happen in physical spaces.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
It's also going to now happen in virtual spaces,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
and we have to get better at figuring that out.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000
I think, of the people that build all this technology in the network,

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
a lot of them aren't very good

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
at connecting with people.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
This is kind of like something I used to do

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
in third grade.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
(Laughter)

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
So here's a series of projects

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
over the last few years

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
where I've been inspired by trying to figure out

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
how to really facilitate close connection.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Sometimes they're very, very simple things.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
A Childhood Walk, which is a project

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
where I ask people to remember a walk

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
that they used to take as a child over and over again

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
that was sort of meaningless --

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
like on the route to the bus stop, to a neighbor's house,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
and take it inside of Google Streetview.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
And I promise you,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
if you take that walk inside Google Streetview,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
you come to a moment

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
where something comes back

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
and hits you in the face.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
And I collected those moments --

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
the photos inside Google Streetview

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
and the memories, specifically.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
"Our conversation started with me saying, 'I'm bored,'

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
and her replying, 'When I'm bored I eat pretzels.'

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
I remember this distinctly because it came up a lot."

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
"Right after he told me and my brother

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
he was going to be separating from my mom,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
I remember walking to a convenience store

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
and getting a cherry cola."

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
"They used some of the morbidly artist footage,

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
a close-up of Chad's shoes in the middle of the highway.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
I guess the shoes came off when he was hit.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
He slept over at my house once, and he left his pillow.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
It had 'Chad' written in magic marker on it.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
He died long after he left the pillow at my house,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
but we never got around to returning it."

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Sometimes they're a little bit more abstract.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
This is Pain Pack.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Right after September 11th, last year,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
I was thinking about pain and the way that we disperse it,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
the way that we excise it from our bodies.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
So what I did is I opened up a hotline --

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
a hotline where people could leave voicemails of their pain,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
not necessarily related to that event.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
And people called in and left messages like this.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Recording: Okay, here's something.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
I'm not alone,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
and I am loved.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
I'm really fortunate.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
But sometimes I feel really lonely.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And when I feel that way

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
even the smallest act of kindness

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
can make me cry.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Like even people in convenience stores

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
saying, "Have a nice day,"

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
when they're accidentally looking me in the eye.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
ZF: So what I did was I took those voicemails,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
and with their permission, converted them to MP3s

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
and distributed them to sound editors

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
who created short sounds

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
using just those voicemails.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
And those were then distributed to DJs

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
who have made hundreds of songs

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
using that source material.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
(Music)

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
We don't have time to play much of it.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
You can look at it online.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
"From 52 to 48 with love"

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
was a project around the time of the last election cycle,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
where McCain and Obama both,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
in their speeches after the election, talked about reconciliation,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
and I was like, "What the hell

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
does that look like?"

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
So I thought, "Well let's just give it a try.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Let's have people hold up signs about reconciliation."

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
And so some really nice things came together.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
"I voted blue. I voted red.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Together, for our future."

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
These are very, very cute little things right.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Some came from the winning party.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
"Dear 48, I promise to listen to you, to fight for you, to respect you always."

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Some came from the party who had just lost.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
"From a 48 to a 52, may your party's leadership be as classy as you,

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
but I doubt it."

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000
But the truth was that as this start becoming popular,

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
a couple rightwing blogs and some message boards

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
apparently found it to be a little patronizing,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
which I could also see.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
And so I started getting amazing amounts of hate mail,

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
death threats even.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
And one guy in particular kept on writing me these pretty awful messages,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
and he was dressed as Batman.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
And he said, "I'm dressed as Batman to hide my identity."

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
Just in case I thought the real Batman

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
was coming after me;

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
which actually made me feel a little better --

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
like, "Phew, it's not him."

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
So what I did --

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
unfortunately, I was harboring all this kind of

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000
awful experience and this pain inside of me,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
and it started to eat away at my psyche.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
And I was protecting the project from it, I realized. I was protecting it --

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
I didn't want this special, little group of photographs

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
to get sullied in some way.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
So what I did, I took all those emails,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
and I put them together into something called Angrigami,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
which was an origami template

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
made out of this sort of vile stuff.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
And I asked people to send me beautiful things

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
made out of the Angrigami.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
(Laughter)

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
But this was the emotional moment.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
One of my viewer's uncles died on a particular day

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000
and he chose to commemorate it with a piece of hate.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
It's amazing.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
The last thing I'm going to tell you about is a series of projects

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
called Songs You Already Know,

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
where the idea was,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
I was trying to figure out to address

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
particular kinds of emotions with group projects.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
So one of them was fairly straightforward.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
A guy said that his daughter got scared at night

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
and could I write a song for her, his daughter.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
And I said, "Oh yeah,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
I'll try to write a mantra that she can sing to herself

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
to help herself go to sleep."

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
And this was "Scared."

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
(Video) ♫ This is a song that I sing when I'm scared of something ♫

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000
♫ I don't know why but it helps me get over it ♫

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
♫ The words of the song just move me along ♫

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
♫ And somehow I get over it ♫

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
♫ At least I don't suck at life ♫

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
♫ I keep on trying despite ♫

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
♫ At least I don't suck at life ♫

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
♫ I keep on trying despite ♫

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
♫ This is a song that I sing when I'm scared of something ♫

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Okay, so I wrote that song, right. Thank you.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
So the nice thing was is he walked by his daughter's room at some point,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
and she actually was singing that song to herself.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
So I was like, "Awesome. This is great."

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
And then I got this email. And there's a little bit of a back story to this.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000
And I don't have much time.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
But the idea was that at one point

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
I did a project called Facebook Me Equals You,

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
where I wanted to experience what it was like

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
to live as another person.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
So I asked for people's usernames and passwords to be sent to me.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
And I got a lot, like 30 in a half an hour.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
And I shut that part down.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
And I chose two people to be,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
and I asked them to send me descriptions

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
of how to act as them on Facebook.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
One person sent me a very detailed description;

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
the other person didn't.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
And the person who didn't, it turned out,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
had just moved to a new city and taken on a new job.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
So, you know, people were writing me and saying, "How's your new job?"

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
I was like, "I don't know.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Didn't know I had one."

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
But anyway, this same person, Laura,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
ended up emailing me a little bit after that project.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
And I felt badly for not having done a good job.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.000
And she said, "I'm really anxious, I just moved to a new town, I have this new job,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
and I've just had this incredible amount of anxiety."

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000
So she had seen the "Scared" song and wondered if I could do something.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
So I asked her, "What does it feel like when you feel this way?"

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
And she wrote a sort of descriptive set

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
of what it felt like to have had this anxiety.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
And so what I decided to do.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
I said, "Okay, I'll think about it."

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
And so quietly in the background, I started sending people this.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
(Audio) ♫ Hey ♫

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
♫ You're okay ♫

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
♫ You'll be fine ♫

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
So I asked people

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
whether they had basic audio capabilities,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
just so they could sing along to the song with headphones on,

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
so I could just get their voices back.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000
And this is the kind of thing that I got back.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Recording: ♫ Hey ♫

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
♫ You're okay ♫

♫ You'll be fine ♫

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
ZF: So that's one of the better ones, really.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
But what's awesome is, as I started getting more and more and more of them,

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000
all of a sudden I had 30, 40 voices from around the world.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
And when you put them together, something magical happens,

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
something absolutely incredible happens,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
and all of a sudden I get a chorus from around the world.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
And what was really great is, I'm putting all this work together in the background,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
and Laura sent me a follow-up email because a good month had passed by.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
And she said, "I know you've forgotten about me.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
I just want to say thanks for even considering it."

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
And then a few days later I sent her this.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:58.000
(Audio) ♫ Right now, it feels like I forgot to turn the light on ♫

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
