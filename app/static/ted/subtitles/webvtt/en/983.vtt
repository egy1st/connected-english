00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The stories we tell about each other

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
matter very much.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The stories we tell ourselves about our own lives matter.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And most of all,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I think the way that we participate in each other's stories

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
is of deep importance.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I was six years old

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
when I first heard stories about the poor.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Now I didn't hear those stories from the poor themselves,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I heard them from my Sunday school teacher

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and Jesus, kind of via my Sunday school teacher.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I remember learning that people who were poor

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
needed something material --

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
food, clothing, shelter -- that they didn't have.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And I also was taught, coupled with that,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
that it was my job -- this classroom full of five and six year-old children --

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
it was our job, apparently, to help.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
This is what Jesus asked of us.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And then he said, "What you do for the least of these, you do for me."

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Now I was pretty psyched.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
I was very eager to be useful in the world --

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I think we all have that feeling.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And also, it was kind of interesting that God needed help.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
That was news to me,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and it felt like it was a very important thing to get to participate in.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
But I also learned very soon thereafter

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
that Jesus also said, and I'm paraphrasing,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
the poor would always be with us.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
This frustrated and confused me;

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I felt like I had been just given a homework assignment

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
that I had to do, and I was excited to do,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
but no matter what I would do, I would fail.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
So I felt confused, a little bit frustrated and angry,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
like maybe I'd misunderstood something here.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And I felt overwhelmed.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
And for the first time,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I began to fear this group of people

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and to feel negative emotion towards a whole group of people.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I imagined in my head, a kind of long line of individuals

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
that were never going away, that would always be with us.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
They were always going to ask me to help them and give them things,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
which I was excited to do,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
but I didn't know how it was going to work.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And I didn't know what would happen when I ran out of things to give,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
especially if the problem was never going away.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
In the years following,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
the other stories I heard about the poor growing up

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
were no more positive.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
For example, I saw pictures and images

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
frequently of sadness and suffering.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I heard about things that were going wrong in the lives of the poor.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I heard about disease, I heard about war --

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
they always seemed to be kind of related.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And in general,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I got this sort of idea

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
that the poor in the world lived lives

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
that were wrought with suffering and sadness,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
devastation, hopelessness.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And after a while, I developed what I think many of us do,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
is this predictable response,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
where I started to feel bad every time I heard about them.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I started to feel guilty for my own relative wealth,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
because I wasn't doing more, apparently, to make things better.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
And I even felt a sense of shame because of that.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And so naturally,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I started to distance myself.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
I stopped listening to their stories

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
quite as closely as I had before.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And I stopped expecting things to really change.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Now I still gave -- on the outside it looked like I was still quite involved.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
I gave of my time and my money,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
I gave when solutions were on sale.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
The cost of a cup of coffee can save a child's life, right.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
I mean who can argue with that?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I gave when I was cornered, when it was difficult to avoid

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and I gave, in general, when the negative emotions built up enough

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
that I gave to relieve my own suffering,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
not someone else's.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
The truth be told, I was giving out of that place,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
not out of a genuine place of hope

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
and excitement to help and of generosity.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
It became a transaction for me,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
became sort of a trade.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
I was purchasing something --

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
I was buying my right to go on with my day

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
and not necessarily be bothered by this bad news.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And I think the way that we go through that sometimes

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
can, first of all,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
disembody a group of people, individuals out there in the world.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And it can also turn into a commodity,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
which is a very scary thing.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
So as I did this, and as I think many of us do this,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
we kind of buy our distance,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
we kind of buy our right to go on with our day.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
I think that exchange can actually get in the way of the very thing that we want most.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
It can get in the way of our desire

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
to really be meaningful and useful in another person's life

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
and, in short to love.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Thankfully, a few years ago, things shifted for me

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
because I heard this gentleman speak, Dr. Muhammad Yunus.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
I know many in the room probably know exactly who he is,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
but to give the shorthand version

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
for any who have not heard him speak,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
Dr. Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
for his work pioneering modern microfinance.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
When I heard him speak, it was three years before that.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
But basically, microfinance -- if this is new to you as well --

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
think of that as financial services for the poor.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Think of all the things you get at your bank

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
and imagine those products and services

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
tailored to the needs of someone living on a few dollars a day.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Dr. Yunus shared his story,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
explaining what that was,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
and what he had done with his Grameen Bank.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
He also talked about, in particular, microlending,

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
which is a tiny loan

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
that could help someone start or grow a business.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Now, when I heard him speak, it was exciting for a number of reasons.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
First and foremost, I learned about this new method of change in the world

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
that, for once, showed me, maybe,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
a way to interact with someone

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
and to give, to share of a resource in a way that wasn't weird

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
and didn't make me feel bad --

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
that was exciting.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
But more importantly, he told stories about the poor

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
that were different than any stories I had heard before.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
In fact, those individuals he talked about who were poor was sort of a side note.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
He was talking about strong, smart,

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
hardworking entrepreneurs who woke up every day

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
and were doing things to make their lives and their family's lives better.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
All they needed to do that more quickly and to do it better

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
was a little bit of capital.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
It was an amazing sort of insight for me.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
And I, in fact, was so deeply moved by this --

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
it's hard to express now how much that affected me --

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
but I was so moved that I actually quit my job a few weeks later,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
and I moved to East Africa

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
to try to see for myself what this was about.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
For the first time, actually, in a long time

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
I wanted to meet those individuals, I wanted to meet these entrepreneurs,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
and see for myself what their lives were actually about.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
So I spent three months in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
interviewing entrepreneurs that had received 100 dollars

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
to start or grow a business.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
And in fact, through those interactions,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
for the first time, I was starting to get to be friends

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
with some of those people in that big amorphous group out there

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
that was supposed to be far away.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
I was starting to be friends and get to know their personal stories.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
And over and over again,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
as I interviewed them and spent my days with them,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
I did hear stories of life change

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
and amazing little details of change.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
So I would hear from goat herders

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
who had used that money that they had received to buy a few more goats.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Their business trajectory would change.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
They would make a little bit more money;

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
their standard of living

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
would shift and would get better.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
And they would make really interesting little adjustments in their lives,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
like they would start to send their children to school.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
They might be able to buy mosquito nets.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Maybe they could afford a lock for the door and feel secure.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Maybe it was just that they could put sugar in their tea

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
and offer that to me when I came as their guest

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
and that made them feel proud.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
But there were these beautiful details, even if I talked to 20 goat herders in a row,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and some days that's what happened --

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
these beautiful details of life change

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
that were meaningful to them.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
That was another thing that really touched me.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
It was really humbling to see for the first time,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
to really understand

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
that even if I could have taken a magic wand and fixed everything,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
I probably would have gotten a lot wrong.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Because the best way for people to change their lives

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
is for them to have control and to do that in a way that they believe is best for them.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
So I saw that and it was very humbling.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Anyway, another interesting thing happened while I was there.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
I never once was asked for a donation,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
which had kind of been my mode, right.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
There's poverty, you give money to help --

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
no one asked me for a donation.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
In fact, no one wanted me to feel bad for them at all.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
If anything, they just wanted to be able to do more of what they were doing already

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
and to build on their own capabilities.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
So what I did hear, once in a while,

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
was that people wanted a loan --

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000
I thought that sounded very reasonable and really exciting.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
And by the way, I was a philosophy and poetry major in school,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
so I didn't know the difference between profit and revenue when I went to East Africa.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
I just got this impression that the money would work.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
And my introduction to business

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
was in these $100 little infuses of capital.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
And I learned about profit and revenue, about leverage, all sorts of things,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
from farmers, from seamstresses, from goat herders.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
So this idea

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
that these new stories of business and hope

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
might be shared with my friends and family,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
and through that, maybe we could get some of the money that they needed

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
to be able to continue their businesses as loans,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
that's this little idea that turned into Kiva.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
A few months later, I went back to Uganda

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
with a digital camera and a basic website

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
that my partner, Matthew, and I had kind of built,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
and took pictures of seven of my new friends,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
posted their stories, these stories of entrepreneurship, up on the website,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
spammed friends and family and said, "We think this is legal.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Haven't heard back yet from SEC on all the details,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
but do you say, do you want to help participate in this,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
provide the money that they need?"

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
The money came in basically overnight.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
We sent it over to Uganda.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
And over the next six months, a beautiful thing happened;

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
the entrepreneurs received the money,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.000
they were paid, and their businesses, in fact, grew,

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
and they were able to support themselves

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
and change the trajectory of their lives.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
In October of '05,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
after those first seven loans were paid,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Matt and I took the word beta off of the site.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
We said, "Our little experiment has been a success.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Let's start for real." That was our official launch.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
And then that first year, October '05 through '06,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Kiva facilitated $500,000 in loans.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
The second year, it was a total of 15 million.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
The third year, the total was up to around 40.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
The fourth year, we were just short of 100.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
And today, less than five years in,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Kiva's facilitated

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
more than 150 million dollars, in little 25-dollar bits,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
from lenders and entrepreneurs --

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
more than a million of those, collectively in 200 countries.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
So that's where Kiva is today, just to bring you right up to the present.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
And while those numbers and those statistics

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
are really fun to talk about and they're interesting,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
to me, Kiva's really about stories.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000
It's about retelling

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
the story of the poor,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
and it's about giving ourselves

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
an opportunity to engage

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
that validates their dignity,

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
validates a partnership relationship,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
not a relationship that's based

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
on the traditional sort of donor beneficiary

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
weirdness that can happen.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
But instead a relationship that can promote respect

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
and hope

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000
and this optimism

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
that together we can move forward.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
So what I hope is that,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
not only can the money keep flowing forth through Kiva --

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
that's a very positive and meaningful thing --

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
but I hope Kiva can blur those lines, like I said,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
between the traditional rich and poor categories

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
that we're taught to see in the world,

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
this false dichotomy of us and them, have and have not.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
I hope that Kiva can blur those lines.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Because as that happens,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
I think we can feel free to interact

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
in a way that's more open, more just and more creative,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
to engage with each other and to help each other.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Imagine how you feel

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
when you see somebody on street who is begging

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
and you're about to approach them.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Imagine how you feel;

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
and then imagine the difference when you might see somebody

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
who has a story of entrepreneurship and hard work

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
who wants to tell you about their business.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Maybe they're smiling, and they want to talk to you about what they've done.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
Imagine if you're speaking with somebody

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
who's growing things and making them flourish,

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
somebody who's using their talents

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
to do something productive,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
somebody who's built their own business from scratch,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
someone who is surrounded by abundance,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
not scarcity,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
who's in fact creating abundance,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
somebody with full hands with something to offer,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
not empty hands

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
asking for you to give them something.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Imagine if you could hear a story you didn't expect

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
of somebody who wakes up every day

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
and works very, very hard to make their life better.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
These stories can really change the way that we think about each other.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
And if we can catalyze

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
a supportive community to come around these individuals

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
and to participate in their story

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000
by lending a little bit of money,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
I think that can change the way we believe in each other

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
and each other's potential.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Now for me, Kiva is just the beginning.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
And as I look forward to what is next,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000
it's been helpful to reflect on the things I've learned so far.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
The first one is, as I mentioned, entrepreneurship was a new idea to me.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Kiva borrowers, as I interviewed them and got to know them over the last few years,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
have taught me what entrepreneurship is.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000
And I think, at its core, it's deciding that you want your life to be better.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
You see an opportunity

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
and you decide what you're going to do to try to seize that.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
In short, it's deciding that tomorrow can better than today

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
and going after that.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Second thing that I've learned is that loans are a very interesting tool for connectivity.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
So they're not a donation.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Yeah, maybe it doesn't sound that much different.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
But in fact, when you give something to someone

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
and they say, "Thanks," and let you know how things go,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
that's one thing.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
When you lend them money, and they slowly pay you back over time,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
you have this excuse to have an ongoing dialogue.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
This continued attention -- this ongoing attention --

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
is a really big deal

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
to build different kinds of relationships among us.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
And then third, from what I've heard from the entrepreneurs I've gotten to know,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
when all else is equal,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
given the option to have just money to do what you need to do,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
or money plus the support and encouragement

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
of a global community,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000
people choose the community plus the money.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
That's a much more meaningful combination, a more powerful combination.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
So with that in mind, this particular incident

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
has led to the things that I'm working on now.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
I see entrepreneurs everywhere now, now that I'm tuned into this.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
And one thing that I've seen

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
is there are a lot of supportive communities that already exist in the world.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
With social networks,

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
it's an amazing way, growing the number of people that we all have around us

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
in our own supportive communities, rapidly.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
And so, as I have been thinking about this,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
I've been wondering: how can we engage these supportive communities

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
to catalyze even more entrepreneurial ideas

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
and to catalyze all of us

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
to make tomorrow better than today?

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
As I've researched what's going on in the United States,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
a few interesting little insights have come up.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
So one is that, of course, as we all might expect,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
many small businesses in the U.S. and all over the world

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
still need money to grow and to do more of what they want to do

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
or they might need money during a hard month.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
But there's always a need for resources close by.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Another thing is, it turns out,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
those resources don't usually come from the places you might expect --

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
banks, venture capitalists,

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
other organizations and support structures --

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
they come from friends and family.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Some statistics say 85 percent or more of funding for small businesses

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
comes from friends and family.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
That's around 130 billion dollars a year --

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
it's a lot.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
And third, so as people are doing this friends and family fundraising process,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
it's very awkward, people don't know exactly what to ask for,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
how to ask, what to promise in return,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
even though they have the best of intentions

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
and want to thank those people that are supporting them.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
So to harness the power of these supportive communities in a new way

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
and to allow entrepreneurs to decide for themselves

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
exactly what that financial exchange should look like,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
exactly what fits them and the people around them,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
this week actually,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
we're quietly doing a launch of Profounder,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
which is a crowd funding platform for small businesses to raise what they need

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
through investments from their friends and family.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
And it's investments, not donations, not loans,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
but investments that have a dynamic return.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
So the mapping of participating in the story,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
it actually flows with the up and down.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
So in short, it's a do-it-yourself tool

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
for small businesses to raise these funds.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000
And what you can do is go onto the site, create a profile,

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
create investment terms in a really easy way.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
We make it really, really simple for me

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
as well as anyone else who wants to use the site.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
And we allow entrepreneurs to share a percentage of their revenues.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
They can raise up to a million dollars

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
from an unlimited number of unaccredited, unsophisticated investors --

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
everyday people, heaven forbid --

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
and they can share those returns over time --

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
again, whatever terms they set.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
As investors choose to become involved

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
based on those terms,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
they can either take their rewards back as cash,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
or they can decide in advance

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
to give those returns away to a non-profit.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
So they can be a cash, or a cause, investor.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
It's my hope that this kind of tool can show anybody who has an idea

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.000
a path to go do what they want to do in the world

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
and to gather the people around them that they already have,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
the people that know them best

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
and that love them and want to support them,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
to gather them to make this happen.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
So that's what I'm working on now.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
And to close, I just want to say, look these are tools.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Right now, Profounder's right at the very beginning,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
and it's very palpable; it's very clear to me, that it's just a vessel, it's just a tool.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
What we need are for people to care, to actually go use it,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
just like they've cared enough to use Kiva

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
to make those connections.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000
But the good news is I don't think I need to stand here and convince you to care --

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000
I'm not even going to try.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
I don't think, even though we often hear,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
you know, hear the ethical and moral reasons,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
the religious reasons,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
"Here's why caring and giving will make you happier."

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
I don't think we need to be convinced of that. I think we know;

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000
in fact, I think we know so much,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
and it's such a reality

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
that we care so deeply,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
that in fact, what usually stops us

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
is that we're afraid to try and to mess up,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
because we care so very much about helping each other

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000
and being meaningful in each other's lives.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
So what I think I can do today,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
that best thing I can give you --

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
I've given you my story, which is the best I can do.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
And I think I can remind us that we do care.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
I think we all already know that.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
And I think we know that love is resilient enough

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
for us to get out there and try.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Just a sec.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
(Applause)

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Thanks.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:50.000
(Applause)

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Thanks.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
(Applause)

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
For me, the best way to be inspired to try

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
is to stop and to listen

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000
to someone else's story.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
And I'm grateful that I've gotten to do that here at TED.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
And I'm grateful that whenever I do that,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
guaranteed, I am inspired --

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
I am inspired by the person I am listening to.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
And I believe more and more every time I listen

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
in that that person's potential to do great things in the world

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
and in my own potential to maybe help.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
And that --

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
forget the tools, forget the moving around of resources --

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
that stuff's easy.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Believing in each other,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
really being sure when push comes to shove

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
that each one of us can do amazing things in the world,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
that is what can make our stories into love stories

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000
and our collective story

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000
into one that continually perpetuates hope

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
and good things for all of us.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
So that, this belief in each other,

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
knowing that without a doubt

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
and practicing that every day in whatever you do,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
that's what I believe will change the world and make tomorrow better than today.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Thank you.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:11.000
(Applause)
