WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This technology

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
made a very important impact on us.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
It changed the way our history developed.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
But it's a technology so pervasive,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
so invisible,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
that we, for a long time,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
forgot to take it into account

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
when we talked about

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
human evolution.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
But we see the results of this technology, still.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So let's make a little test.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So everyone of you turns to their neighbor please.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Turn and face your neighbors.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Please, also on the balcony.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Smile. Smile. Open the mouths.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Smile, friendly.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
(Laughter)

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Do you --

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Do you see any Canine teeth?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
(Laughter)

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Count Dracula teeth

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
in the mouths of your neighbors?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Of course not.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Because our dental anatomy

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
is actually made,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
not for tearing down raw meat from bones

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
or chewing fibrous leaves for hours.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
It is made for a diet

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
which is soft, mushy,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
which is reduced in fibers,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
which is very easily chewable

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
and digestible.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Sounds like fast food, doesn't it.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
(Laughter)

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
It's for cooked food.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
We carry in our face the proof

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
that cooking,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
food transformation,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
made us what we are.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
So I would suggest that we change how we classify ourselves.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
We talk about ourselves as omnivores.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I would say, we should call ourselves coctivors --

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
(Laughter)

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
from coquere, to cook.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
We are the animals

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
who eat cooked food.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
No, no, no, no. Better --

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
to live of cooked food.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
So cooking is a very important technology.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
It's technology.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
I don't know how you feel,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
but I like to cook for entertainment.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
And you need some design

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
to be successful.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
So, cooking is a very important technology,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
because it allowed us to acquire

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
what brought you all here:

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
the big brain,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
this wonderful cerebral cortex we have.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Because brains are expensive.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Those have to pay tuition fees know.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
(Laughter)

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
But it's also, metabolically speaking, expensive.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
You now, our brain is two to three percent of the body mass,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
but actually it uses 25 percent of the total energy we use.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
It's very expensive.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Where does the energy come from. Of course, from food.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
If we eat raw food,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
we cannot release really the energy.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
So this ingenuity of our ancestors,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
to invent this most marvelous technology.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Invisible -- everyone of us does it every day, so to speak.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Cooking made it possible

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
that mutations,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
natural selections, our environment,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
could develop us.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
So if we think about

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
this unleashing human potential,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
which was possible by cooking and food,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
why do we talk so badly about food?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Why is it always do and don'ts

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and it's good for you, it's not good for you?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
I think the good news for me

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
would be if we could go back

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
and talk about the unleashing,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
the continuation of the unleashing of human potential.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Now, cooking allowed also

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
that we became a migrant species.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
We walked out of Africa two times.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
We populated all the ecologies.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
If you can cook, nothing can happen to you,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
because whatever you find,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
you will try to transform it.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
It keeps also your brain working.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Now the very easy and simple technology

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
which was developed

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
actually runs after this formula.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Take something which looks like food, transform it,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
and it gives you a good, very easy, accessible energy.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
This technology affected two organs,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
the brain and the gut, which it actually affected.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
The brain could grow, but the gut actually shrunk.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
Okay, it's not obvious to be honest.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
(Laughter)

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
But it shrunk to 60 percent

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
of primate gut

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
of my body mass.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
So because of having cooked food,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
it's easier to digest.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Now having a large brain, as you know,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
is a big advantage,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
because you can actually influence your environment.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
You can influence your own technologies you have invented.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
You can continue to innovate and invent.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Now the big brain did this also with cooking.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
But how did it actually run this show?

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
How did it actually interfere?

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
What kind of criteria did it use?

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000
And this is actually taste reward and energy.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
You know we have up to five tastes,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
three of them sustain us.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Sweet -- energy.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Umami -- this is a meaty taste.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
You need proteins for muscles, recovery.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Salty,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000
because you need salt, otherwise your electric body will not work.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And two tastes which protect you --

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
bitter and sour,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
which are against

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
poisonous and rotten material.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
But of course, they are hard-wired

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
but we use them still in a sophisticated way.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Think about bittersweet chocolate;

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
or think about the acidity

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
of yogurt -- wonderful --

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
mixed with strawberry fruits.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
So we can make mixtures of all this kind of thing

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
because we know

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
that, in cooking, we can transform it

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
to the form.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Reward: this is a more complex

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
and especially integrative

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
form of our brain

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
with various different elements --

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
the external states, our internal states,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
how do we feel, and so on are put together.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
And something which maybe you don't like

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
but you are so hungry that you really will be satisfied to eat.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
So satisfaction was a very important part.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And as I say, energy was necessary.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Now how did the gut actually

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
participate in this development?

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And the gut is a silent voice --

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
it's going more for feelings.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
I use the euphemism digestive comfort --

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
actually -- it's a digestive discomfort,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
which the gut is concerned with.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
If you get a stomach ache, if you get a little bit bloated,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
was not the right food, was not the right cooking manipulation

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
or maybe other things went wrong.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
So my story is a tale of two brains,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
because it might surprise you,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
our gut has a full-fledged brain.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
All the managers in the room say,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
"You don't tell me something new, because we know, gut feeling.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
This is what we are using."

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
(Laughter)

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
And actually you use it and it's actually useful.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Because our gut is connected to our emotional limbic system,

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
they do speak with each other

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
and make decisions.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
But what it means

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
to have a brain there

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
is that, not only the big brain

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
has to talk with the food,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
the food has to talk with the brain,

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
because we have to learn actually

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
how to talk to the brains.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Now if there's a gut brain,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
we should also learn to talk with this brain.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Now 150 years ago,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
anatomists described very, very carefully --

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000
here is a model of a wall of a gut.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
I took the three elements --

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
stomach, small intestine and colon.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
And within this structure,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
you see these two pinkish layers,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
which are actually the muscle.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
And between this muscle, they found nervous tissues,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
a lot of nervous tissues,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
which penetrate actually the muscle --

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
penetrate the submucosa,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
where you have all the elements for the immune system.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
The gut is actually the largest immune system,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
defending your body.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
It penetrates the mucosa.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
This is the layer which actually touches the food you are swallowing

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
and you digest,

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
which is actually the lumen.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Now if you think about the gut,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
the gut is -- if you could stretch it --

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
40 meters long,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
the length of a tennis court.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
If we could unroll it,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
get out all the folds and so on,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
it would have 400 sq. meters of surface.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
And now this brain takes care over this,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
to move it with the muscles and to do defend the surface

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
and, of course, digest our food we cook.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
So if we give you a specification,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
this brain, which is autonomous,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
have 500 million nerve cells,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
100 million neurons --

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
so around the size of a cat brain,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
so there sleeps a little cat --

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
thinks for itself,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
optimizes whatever it digests.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
It has 20 different neuron types.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
It's got the same diversity you find actually in a pig brain,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
where you have 100 billion neurons.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
It has autonomous organized microcircuits,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
has these programs which run.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
It senses the food; it knows exactly what to do.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
It senses it by chemical means

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
and very importantly by mechanical means,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
because it has to move the food --

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
it has to mix all the various elements

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
which we need for digestion.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
This control of muscle is very, very important,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
because, you know, there can be reflexes.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
If you don't like a food, especially if you're a child, you gag.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
It's this brain which makes this reflex.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
And then finally,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
it controls also the secretion of this molecular machinery,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
which actually digests the food we cook.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Now how do the two brains work with each other?

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
I took here a model from robotics --

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
it's called the Subsumption Architecture.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
What it means is that we have a layered control system.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
The lower layer, our gut brain,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
has its own goals -- digestion defense --

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
and we have the higher brain

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
with the goal of integration

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
and generating behaviors.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Now both look -- and this is the blue arrows --

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000
both look to the same food, which is in the lumen

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
and in the area of your intestine.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
The big brain integrates signals,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
which come from the running programs

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
of the lower brain,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
But subsumption means

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
that the higher brain can interfere with the lower.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
It can replace,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
or it can inhibit actually, signals.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
So if we take two types of signals --

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
a hunger signal for example.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
If you have an empty stomach,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
your stomach produces a hormone called ghrelin.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
It's a very big signal;

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
it's sent to the brain says,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
"Go and eat."

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
You have stop signals --

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
we have up to eight stop signals.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
At least in my case,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
they are not listened to.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
(Laughter)

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
So what happens

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
if the big brain in the integration

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
overrides the signal?

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
So if you override the hunger signal,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000
you can have a disorder, which is called anorexia.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Despite generating

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
a healthy hunger signal,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
the big brain ignores it

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
and activates different programs in the gut.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
The more usual case

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
is overeating.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
It actually takes the signal

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
and changes it,

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
and we continue,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
even [though] our eight signals would say, "Stop, enough.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
We have transferred enough energy."

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Now the interesting thing is that,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
along this lower layer -- this gut --

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
the signal becomes stronger and stronger

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
if undigested, but digestible, material

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
could penetrate.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
This we found from bariatric surgery.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
That then the signal would be very, very high.

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
So now back to the cooking question

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
and back to the design.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
We have learned to talk to the big brain --

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
taste and reward, as you know.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Now what would be the language

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
we have to talk to the gut brain

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
that its signals are so strong

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
that the big brain cannot ignore it?

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Then we would generate something

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
all of us would like to have --

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
a balance between the hunger

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
and the satiation.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Now I give you, from our research, a very short claim.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
This is fat digestion.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
You have on your left

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
an olive oil droplet,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
and this olive oil droplet gets attacked by enzymes.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
This is an in vitro experiment.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
It's very difficult to work in the intestine.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Now everyone would expect

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
that when the degradation of the oil happens,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
when the constituents are liberated,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
they disappear, they go away

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
because they [were] absorbed.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Actually, what happens is that a very intricate structure appears.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
And I hope you can see

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
that there are some ring-like structures in the middle image,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
which is water.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
This whole system generates a huge surface

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
to allow more enzymes

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
to attack the remaining oil.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000
And finally, on your right side,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
you see a bubbly,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
cell-like structure appearing,

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
from which the body will absorb the fat.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Now if we could take this language --

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
and this is a language of structures --

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
and make it longer-lasting,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
that it can go through

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
the passage of the intestine,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
it would generate stronger signals.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
So our research --

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
and I think the research also at the universities --

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000
are now fixing on these points

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
to say: how can we actually --

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
and this might sound trivial now to you --

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
how can we change cooking?

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
How can we cook

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
that we have this language developed?

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000
So what we have actually, it's not an omnivore's dilemma.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000
We have a coctivor's opportunity,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
because we have learned over the last two million years

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
which taste and reward --

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.000
quite sophisticated to cook --

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
to please ourselves, to satisfy ourselves.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
If we add the matrix,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000
if we add the structure language, which we have to learn,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
when we learn it, then we can put it back;

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
and around energy,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
we could generate a balance,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
which comes out

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
from our really primordial operation: cooking.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
So, to make cooking really

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
a very important element,

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
I would say even philosophers have to change

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
and have to finally recognize

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
that cooking is what made us.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
So I would say, coquo ergo sum:

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
I cook, therefore I am.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Thank you very much.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
(Applause)
