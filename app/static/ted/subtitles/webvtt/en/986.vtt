00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm a visual artist,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and I'm also one of the co-founders of the Plastic Pollution Coalition.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I've been working with plastic bags,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
which I cut up and sew back together as my primary material for my artwork

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
for the last 20 years.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I turn them into two and three-dimensional pieces

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and sculptures and installations.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Upon working with the plastic, after about the first eight years,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
some of my work started to fissure

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and break down into smaller little bits of plastic.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
And I thought, "Great.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
It's ephemeral just like us."

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Upon educating myself a little further about plastics,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I actually realized this was a bad thing.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
It's a bad thing that plastic breaks down into smaller little bits,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
because it's always still plastic.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And what we're finding

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
is that a lot of it is in the marine environment.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I then, in the last few years,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
learned about the Pacific garbage patch and the gyre.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And my initial reaction --

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and I think this is a lot of people's first reaction

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
to learning about it --

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
is, "Oh my God!

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We've got to go out there and clean this thing up."

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
So I actually developed a proposal

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
to go out with a cargo ship

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
and two decommissioned fishing trawlers,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
a crane, a chipping machine

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and a cold-molding machine.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And my intention was to go out to the gyre,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
raise awareness about this issue

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and begin to pick up the plastic,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
chip it into little bits and cold mold it into bricks

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
that could potentially be used as building materials

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
in underdeveloped communities.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
I began talking with people

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
who actually had been out to the gyre

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and were studying the plastic problem in the marine environment

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and upon doing so,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
I realized actually that cleaning it up

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
would be a very small drop in the bucket

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
relative to how much is being generated

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
every day around the world,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and that actually I needed to back up and look at the bigger picture.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And the bigger picture is:

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
we need to find a way to turn off the faucet.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
We need to cut the spigot

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
of single-use and disposable plastics,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
which are entering the marine environment every day

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
on a global scale.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
So in looking at that, I also realized that I was really angry.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I wasn't just concerned about plastic

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
that you're trying to imagine out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean --

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
of which I have learned there are now

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
11 gyres, potentially, of plastic

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
in five major oceans in the world.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
It's not just that gyre of plastic that I'm concerned about --

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
it's the gyre of plastic in the supermarket.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
I'd go to the supermarket and all of my food is packaged in plastic.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
All of my beverages are packaged in plastic,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
even at the health food market.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
I'm also concerned about the plastic in the refrigerator,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and I'm concerned about the plastic and the toxins that leach from plastic

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
into us and into our bodies.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
So I came together with a group of other people

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
who were all looking at this issue,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and we created the Plastic Pollution Coalition.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
We have many initiatives that we're working on,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
but some of them are very basic.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
One is: if 80 to 90 percent

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
of what we're finding in the ocean --

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
of the marine debris that we're finding in the ocean -- is plastic,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
then why don't we call it what it is.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
It's plastic pollution.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Recycling -- everybody kind of ends their books

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
about being sustainable and greening with the idea of recycling.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
You put something in a bin and you don't have to think about it again.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
What is the reality of that?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
In the United States, less than seven percent of our plastics are recycled.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And if you really look into it,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
particularly when it comes to plastic bottles,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
most of it is only down-cycled,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
or incinerated, or shipped to China.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
It is down-cycled and turned into lesser things,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
while a glass bottle can be a glass bottle again

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
or can be used again --

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
a plastic bottle can never be a plastic bottle again.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
So this is a big issue for us.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Another thing that we're looking at and asking people to think about

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
is we've added a fourth R

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
onto the front

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
of the "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle," three R's,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
and that is refuse.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Whenever possible, refuse single-use and disposable plastics.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Alternatives exist;

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
some of them are very old-school.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
I myself am now collecting these cool Pyrex containers

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and using those instead of Glad and Tupperware containers

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
to store food in.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
And I know that I am doing a service

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
to myself and my family.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
It's very easy to pick up a stainless-steel bottle

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
or a glass bottle,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
if you're traveling and you've forgotten to bring your stainless-steel bottle

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
and fill that up with water or filtered water,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
versus purchasing plastic bottled water.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
I guess what I want to say to everybody here --

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
and I know that you guys know a lot about this issue --

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
is that this is a huge problem in the oceans,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
but this is a problem that we've created as consumers

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
and we can solve.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
We can solve this by raising awareness of the issue

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
and teaching people to choose alternatives.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
So whenever possible, to choose alternatives

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
to single-use plastics.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
We can cut the stem -- tide the stem of this

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
into our oceans

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
and in doing so,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
save our oceans, save our planet, save ourselves.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Thank you. (Applause)
