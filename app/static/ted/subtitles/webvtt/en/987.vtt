WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So yeah, I'm a newspaper cartoonist --

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
political cartoonist.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I don't know if you've heard about it -- newspapers?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
It's a sort of paper-based reader.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
(Laughter)

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It's lighter than an iPad,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
it's a bit cheaper.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
You know what they say?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
They say the print media is dying --

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
who says that? Well, the media.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
But this is no news, right?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
You've read about it already.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
(Laughter)

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
the world has gotten smaller.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
I know it's a cliche, but look,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
look how small,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
how tiny it has gotten.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
And you know the reason why, of course.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
This is because of technology -- yeah.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
(Laughter)

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Any computer designers in the room?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Yeah well,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
you guys are making my life miserable

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
because track pads used to be round,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
a nice round shape.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
That makes a good cartoon.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
But what are you going to do with a flat track pad,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
those square things?

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
There's nothing I can do as a cartoonist.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Well, I know the world is flat now.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
That's true.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And the Internet has reached

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
every corner of the world,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
the poorest, the remotest places.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Every village in Africa now has a cyber cafe.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
(Laughter)

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Don't go asking for a Frappuccino there.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
So we are bridging the digital divide.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
The Third World is connected,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
we are connected.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And what happens next?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Well, you've got mail.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Yeah.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Well, the Internet has empowered us.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
It has empowered you,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
it has empowered me

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and it has empowered some other guys as well.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
(Laughter)

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
You know, these last two cartoons --

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I did them live

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
during a conference in Hanoi.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
And they were not used to that

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
in communist 2.0 Vietnam.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
(Laughter)

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
So I was cartooning live on a wide screen --

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
it was quite a sensation --

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and then this guy came to me.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
He was taking pictures of me and of my sketches,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and I thought, "This is great, a Vietnamese fan."

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
And as he came the second day,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I thought, "Wow, that's really a cartoon lover."

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
And on the third day, I finally understood,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
the guy was actually on duty.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
So by now, there must be a hundred pictures of me

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
smiling with my sketches

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
in the files of the Vietnamese police.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
(Laughter)

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
No, but it's true: the Internet has changed the world.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
It has rocked the music industry;

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
it has changed the way we consume music.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
For those of you old enough to remember,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
we used to have to go to the store

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
to steal it.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
(Laughter)

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And it has changed the way

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
your future employer

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
will look at your application.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
So be careful

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
with that Facebook account --

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
your momma told you, be careful.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And technology has set us free --

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
this is free WiFi.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
But yeah, it has liberated us

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
from the office desk.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
This is your life,

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
enjoy it.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
(Laughter)

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
In short, technology, the internet,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
they have changed our lifestyle.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Tech guru, like this man --

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
that a German magazine called the philosopher of the 21st century --

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
they are shaping the way we do things.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
They are shaping the way we consume.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
They are shaping our very desires.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
(Laughter)

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000
(Applause)

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
You will not like it.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
And technology has even changed

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
our relationship to God.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.000
(Laughter)

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Now I shouldn't get into this.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Religion and political cartoons,

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
as you may have heard,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
make a difficult couple,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
ever since that day of 2005,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
when a bunch of cartoonists in Denmark

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
drew cartoons that had repercussions all over the world --

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
demonstrations, fatwa,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
they provoked violence. People died in the violence.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
This was so sickening;

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
people died because of cartoons.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
I mean --

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
I had the feeling at the time

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
that cartoons had been used by both sides, actually.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
They were used first by a Danish newspaper,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
which wanted to make a point on Islam.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
A Danish cartoonist told me he was one of the 24

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
who received the assignment to draw the prophet --

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
12 of them refused. Did you know that?

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
He told me, "Nobody has to tell me what I should draw.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
This is not how it works."

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
And then, of course, they were used

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
by extremists and politicians on the other side.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
They wanted to stir up controversy.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
You know the story.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
We know that cartoons can be used as weapons.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
History tells us,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
they've been used by the Nazis

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
to attack the Jews.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
And here we are now.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
In the United Nations,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
half of the world is pushing

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
to penalize the offense to religion --

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
they call it the defamation of religion --

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
while the other half of the world is fighting back

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
in defense of freedom of speech.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
So the clash of civilizations is here,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
and cartoons are at the middle of it?

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
This got me thinking.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Now you see me thinking

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
at my kitchen table,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
and since you're in my kitchen,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
please meet my wife.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:28.000
(Laughter)

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
In 2006, a few months after,

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
I went Ivory Coast --

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Western Africa.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Now, talk of a divided place -- the country was cut in two.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000
You had a rebellion in the North,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
the government in the South -- the capital, Abidjan --

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
and in the middle, the French army.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
This looks like a giant hamburger.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
You don't want to be the ham in the middle.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
I was there to report on that story

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
in cartoons.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
I've been doing this for the last 15 years;

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
it's my side job, if you want.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
So you see the style is different.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
This is more serious than maybe editorial cartooning.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
I went to places like Gaza

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
during the war in 2009.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
So this is really journalism in cartoons.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
You'll hear more and more about it.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
This is the future of journalism, I think.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
And of course, I went to see the rebels in the north.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Those were poor guys fighting for their rights.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
There was an ethnic side to this conflict

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
as very often in Africa.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
And I went to see the Dozo.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
The Dozo, they are the traditional hunters

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
of West Africa.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
People fear them --

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
they help the rebellion a lot.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
They are believed to have magical powers.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
They can disappear and escape bullets.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
I went to see a Dozo chief;

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
he told me about his magical powers.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
He said, "I can chop your head off right away

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
and bring you back to life."

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
I said, "Well, maybe we don't have time for this right now."

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
(Laughter)

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
"Another time."

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
So back in Abidjan,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
I was given a chance to lead a workshop

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
with local cartoonists there

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
and I thought, yes,

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
in a context like this, cartoons can really be used as weapons

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
against the other side.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
I mean, the press in Ivory Coast was bitterly divided --

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
it was compared to the media in Rwanda

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
before the genocide --

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
so imagine.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And what can a cartoonist do?

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Sometimes editors would tell their cartoonists

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
to draw what they wanted to see,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
and the guy has to feed his family, right?

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
So the idea was pretty simple.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
We brought together cartoonists

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
from all sides in Ivory Coast.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
We took them away from their newspaper for three days.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000
And I asked them to do a project together,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
tackle the issues affecting their country

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
in cartoons, yes, in cartoons.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Show the positive power of cartoons.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
It's a great tool of communication

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
for bad or for good.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
And cartoons can cross boundaries,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
as you have seen.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
And humor is a good way, I think,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
to address serious issues.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
And I'm very proud of what they did.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
I mean, they didn't agree with each other -- that was not the point.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
And I didn't ask them to do nice cartoons.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
The first day, they were even shouting at each other.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
But they came up with a book,

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
looking back at 13 years

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
of political crisis in Ivory Coast.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
So the idea was there.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
And I've been doing projects like this,

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
in 2009 in Lebanon,

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
this year in Kenya, back in January.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
In Lebanon, it was not a book.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
The idea was to have --

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
the same principal, a divided country --

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000
take cartoonists from all sides

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
and let them do something together.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
So in Lebanon,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
we enrolled the newspaper editors,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
and we got them to publish

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
eight cartoonists from all sides all together on the same page,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000
addressing the issue affecting Lebanon,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
like religion in politics and everyday life.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
And it worked.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
For three days, almost all the newspapers of Beirut

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
published all those cartoonists together --

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
anti-government,

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
pro-government,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Christian,

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Muslim, of course,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
English-speaking, well, you name it.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
So this was a great project.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
And then in Kenya, what we did

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
was addressing the issue of ethnicity,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000
which is a poison in a lot of places in Africa.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000
And we did video clips --

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
you can see them if you go to YouTube/Kenyatoons.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
So, preaching for freedom of speech

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
is easy here,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
but as you have seen

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
in contexts of repression or division,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
again, what can a cartoonist do?

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
He has to keep his job.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Well I believe that in any context anywhere,

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
he always has the choice at least

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
not to do a cartoon

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
that will feed hatred.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
And that's the message I try to convey to them.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
I think we all always have the choice in the end

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
not to do the bad thing.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
But we need to support

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
these independent, critical

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
and responsible voices

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
in Africa, in Lebanon,

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
in your local newspaper,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
in the Apple store.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Today, tech companies

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000
are the world's largest editors.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
They decide what is too offensive

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
or too provocative for you to see.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
So really, it's not about the freedom of cartoonists;

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
it's about your freedoms.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
And for dictators all over the world,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
the good news

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
is when cartoonists,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
journalists and activists shut up.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Thank you.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:11.000
(Applause)
