00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.000
(Music)

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
♫ Here we stand ♫

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
♫ Like an Adam and an Eve ♫

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
♫ Waterfalls ♫

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
♫ The Garden of Eden ♫

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
♫ Two fools in love ♫

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
♫ So beautiful and strong ♫

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
♫ Birds in the trees ♫

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
♫ Are smiling upon them ♫

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
♫ From the age of the dinosaurs ♫

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
♫ Cars would run on gasoline ♫

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
♫ Where? Where have they gone? ♫

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
♫ Now, there's nothing but flowers ♫

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
♫ This was a factory ♫

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
♫Now there are mountains and rivers ♫

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
♫ You got it, you got it ♫

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
♫ We caught a rattlesnake ♫

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
♫ Now we've got something for dinner ♫

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
♫ You got it, you got it ♫

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
♫ This was a parking lot ♫

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
♫ Now it's all covered with flowers ♫

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
♫ You got it, you got it ♫

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
♫ If this is paradise ♫

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
♫ I wish I had a lawnmower ♫

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
♫ You got it, you got it ♫

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
♫ This was a shopping mall ♫

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
♫ Now it's turned into corn field ♫

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
♫ You got it, you got it ♫

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
♫ Don't leave me stranded here ♫

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
♫ I can't get used to this lifestyle ♫

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
(Applause)

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Thomas Dolby: David Byrne.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
(Applause)
