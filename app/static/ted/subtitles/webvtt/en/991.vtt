WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The big residual

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
is always value for money.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
All the time we are trying to get value for money.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
What we don't look for

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
is value for many,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
while we are generating value for money.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Do we care about those four billion people

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
whose income levels are less than two dollars a day,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
the so-called bottom of the pyramid?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
What are the challenges in getting value for money

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
as well as value for many?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We have described here

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
in terms of the performance

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and the price.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
If you have money, of course, you can get the value.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
You can get a Mercedes

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
for a very high price,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
very high performance.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
But if you don't have money, what happens?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Well, you are to ride a bicycle,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
carrying your own weight and also some other weight,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
so that you can earn the bread for the day.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Well, poor do not remain poor;

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
they become lower-middle-class.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And if they do so,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
then, of course, the conditions improve,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and they start riding on scooters.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
But the challenge is, again, they don't get much value,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
because they can't afford anything more than the scooter.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
The issue is, at that price,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
can you give them some extra value?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
A super value,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
in terms of their ability to ride in a car,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
to get that dignity, to get that safety,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
looks practically impossible, isn't it.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Now, this is something

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
that we see on Indian streets

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
all the time.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
But many people see the same thing

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
and think things differently,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and one of them is here, Ratan Tata.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
The great thing about our leaders

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
is that, should they not only have passion in their belly,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
which practically all of them have,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
they're also very innovative.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
An innovator is one who does not know it cannot be done.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
They believe that things can be done.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
But great leaders like Ratan

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
have compassion.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And what you said, Lakshmi, is absolutely true:

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
it's not just Ratan Tata,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
it's the house of Tatas over time.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Let me confirm what she said.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Yes, I went barefoot

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
until I was 12.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
I struggled to [unclear] day

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
was a huge issue.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And when I finished my SSC, the eleventh standard,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I stood eleventh among 125,000 students.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
But I was about to leave the school,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
because my poor mother couldn't afford schooling.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And it was [unclear] Tata Trust, which gave me six rupees per month,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
almost a dollar per month for six years.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
That's how I'm standing before you.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
So that is the House of Tata.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
(Applause)

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Innovation, compassion and passion.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
They combine all that.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And it was that compassion which bothered them,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
because when he saw -- in fact, he told me about eight or nine years ago

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
how he was driving his own car --

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
he drives his own car by the way --

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
and he saw in the rain,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
a family like the one that I showed to you

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
getting drenched with an infant.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
And then he said, "Well, I must give them a car that they can afford,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
one lakh car, $2,000 car."

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Of course, as soon as you say something like this

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
people say it is impossible,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
and that's what was said by Suzuki.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
He said, oh, probably he is going to build a three-wheeler

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
with stepney.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
And you can see the cartoon here.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Well they didn't build that. They built a proper car. Nano.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
And mind you, I'm six feet half an inch,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Ratan is taller than me,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
and we have ample space in the front

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
and ample space in the back in this particular car.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
And incredible car.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
And of course, nothing succeeds like success;

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
the cynics then turned around,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
and one after the other

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
they also started saying, "Yes, we also want to make a car in the Nano Segment.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
We'll manufacture a car in the Nano Segment."

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
How did this great story unfold,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
the making of Nano?

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Let me tell you a bit about it.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
For example, how we started:

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Ratan just began with a five-engineer team,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
young people in their mid-twenties.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And he said,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
"Well, I won't define the vehicle for you,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
but I will define the cost for you.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
It is one lakh, 100,000 rupees,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
and you are to make it within that."

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
And he told them,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
"Question the unquestionable.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Stretch the envelope."

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
And at a point in time,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000
he got so engrossed in the whole challenge,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
that he himself became a member of the team.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Can you believe it?

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
I still am told about this story

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
of that single wiper design in which he participated.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Until midnight, he'd be thinking.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Early morning he'll be coming back with sort of solutions.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
But who was the team leader?

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
The team leader was Girish Wagh,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
a 34 year-old boy in [unclear].

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
And the Nano team average age

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
was just 27 years.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
And they did innovation in design and beyond.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Broke many norms of the standard conventions for the first time.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
For example, that a two-cylinder gas engine

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
was used in a car with a single balancer shaft.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Adhesives were replacing the rivets.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
There was a co-creation, a huge co-creation,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
with vendors and suppliers.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
All ideas on board were welcome.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
100 vendors were co-located adjacent to the plant,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
and innovative business models for automobile dealerships were developed.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Imagine that a fellow

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
who sells cloth, for example, will be selling Nano.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
I mean, it was incredible innovation.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Seeking solutions for non-auto sectors.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
It was an open innovation,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
ideas from all over were welcome.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
The mechanism of helicopters seats and windows was used, by the way,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
as well as a dashboard

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
that was inspired by two-wheelers.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
The fuel lines and lamps

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
were as in two-wheelers.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
And the crux of the matter was, however,

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
getting more from less.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
All the time, you have been given an envelope.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
You can't cross that envelope,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
which is 100,000 rupees, 2,000 dollars.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
And therefore, each component

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
had to have a dual functionality.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
And the seat riser, for example,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
serving as a mounting for the seat

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
as well as a structural part

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
of the functional rigidity.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
Half the number of parts

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
are contained in Nano

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
in comparison to a typical passenger car.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
The length is smaller by eight percent by the way.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
But the current entry-level cars

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
in comparison to that is eight percent less,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
but 21 percent more inside space.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
And what happened

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
was that -- more from less --

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
you can see how much more for how much less.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
When the Model T was launched --

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
and this is, by the way, all the figures

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
that are adjusted to 2007 dollar prices --

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Model T was 19,700 by Ford.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Volkswagon was 11,333.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
And British Motor was around 11,000.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
And Nano was, bang, 2,000 dollars.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
This is why

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
you started

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
actually a new paradigm shift,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.000
where the same people

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
who could not dream of sitting in a car,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
who were carrying their entire family in a scooter,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
started dreaming of being in a car.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
And those dreams are getting fulfilled.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
This is a photograph

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
of a house and a driver and a car

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
near my own home.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
The driver's name is Naran.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
He has bought his own Nano.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
And you can see, there is a physical space

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
that has been created for him,

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.000
parking that car, along with the owner's car,

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
but more importantly, they've created

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
a space in their mind that

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
"Yes, my chauffeur is going to come in his own car and park it."

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
And that's why I call it a transformational innovation.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
It is not just technological,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
it is social innovation that we talk about.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
And that is where, ladies and gentlemen,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
this famous theme

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
of getting more from less for more

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
becomes important.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
I remember talking about this for the first time in Australia,

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
about one and a half years ago,

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
when their academy honored me with a fellowship.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
And unbelievably, in 40 years,

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
I was the first Indian to be honored.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
And the title of my talk

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
was therefore "Indian innovation

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
from Gandhi to Gandhian engineering."

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
And I titled this more from less for more and more people

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
as Gandhian engineering.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
And Gandhian engineering, in my judgment,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
is the one which is going to take the world forward,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
is going to make a difference,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
not just for a few, but for everyone.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Let me move from mobility in a car to individual mobility

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
for those unfortunates

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
who have lost their legs.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Here is an American citizen and his son

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
having an artificial foot.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
What is its price? 20,000 dollars.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
And of course, these feet are so designed

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
that they can walk only on

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
such perfect pavement or roads.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000
Unfortunately, that's not the case in India.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
You can see him walk barefoot

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
on an awkward land, sometimes in a marshy land,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
and so on and so forth.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
More importantly,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
they not only walk far to work,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
and not only do they cycle to work,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
but they cycle for work, as you can see here.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
And they climb up for their work.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
You have to design an artificial foot for such conditions.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
A challenge, of course.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Four billion people, their incomes are less then two dollars a day.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
And if you talk about a 20,000-dollar shoe,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
you're talking about 10,000 days of income.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
You just don't have it.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
And therefore, you ought to look at alternatives.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
And that is how Jaipur Foot was created in India.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
It had a revolutionary prosthetic fitment and delivery system,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
a quick molding and modular components,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
enabling custom-made, on-the-spot limb fitments.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
You could feel it actually in an hour, by the way,

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
whereas the equivalent other feet

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
took something like a day, as so on.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Outer socket made by using heated high-density polyethylene pipes,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
rather than using heated sheets.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
And unique high-ankle design and human-like looks,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
[unclear] and functions.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
And I like to show how it looks

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
and how it works.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
(Music)

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
See, he jumps. You can see what stress it must have.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
(Text: ... any person with a below the knee limb could do this.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000
... above the limb, yes, it would be difficult ...

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
"Did it hurt?"

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
"No ... not at all."

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.000
... he can run a kilometer in four minutes and 30 seconds ...)

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
One kilometer in four minutes and 30 seconds.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:55.000
(Applause)

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
So that's what it is all about.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
And therefore Time took notice

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
of this 28-dollar foot, basically.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
(Applause)

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000
An incredible story.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Let's move on to something else.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
I've been talking about getting more from less for more.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Let's move to health.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
We've talked about mobility and the rest of it, let's talk about health.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
What's happening in the area of health?

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
You know, you have new diseases that require new drugs.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
And if you look at the drug development 10 years ago and now,

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
what has happened?

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000
10 years ago, it used to cost about a quarter billion.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Today it costs 1.5 billion dollars.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Time taken for moving a molecule to marketplace,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
after all the human and animal testing,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
was 10 years, now it is 15 years.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Are you getting more drugs because you are spending more time and more money?

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
No, I'm sorry.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
We used to have 40, now they have come down to 30.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
So actually we are getting less from more

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
for less and less people.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Why less and less people? Because it is so expensive,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
so very few will be able to basically afford that.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Let us just take an example.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Psoriasis is very dreadful

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
disease of the skin.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
The cost of treatment, 20,000 dollars.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000
1,000-dollar antibody injections under the skin, by the way,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
and 20 of them.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Time for development -- it took around 10 years

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
and 700 million dollars.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
Let's start in the spirit

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
of more from less and more for more

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
and start putting some targets.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000
For example, we don't want 20,000 dollars; we don't have it.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Can we do it [for] 100 dollars?

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Time for development, not 10 years.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
We are in a hurry. Five years.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Cost of development -- 300 million dollars.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Sorry. I can't spend more than 10 million dollars.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Looks absolutely audacious.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Looks absolutely ridiculous.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
You know something? This has been achieved in India.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000
These targets have been achieved in India.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
And how they have been achieved ...

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Sir Francis Bacon once said,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
"When you wish to achieve results

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
that have not been achieved before,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
it is an unwise fancy to think

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
that they can be achieved by using methods

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
that have been used before."

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
And therefore, the standard process,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
where you develop a molecule, put it into mice, into men,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
are not yielding those results --

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
the billions of dollars that have been spent.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
The Indian cleverness

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
was using its traditional knowledge,

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
however, scientifically validating it

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
and making that journey from men to mice to men,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
not molecule to mice to men, you know.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
And that is how this difference has come.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
And you can see this blending

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
of traditional medicine, modern medicine, modern science.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
I launched a big program

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
[unclear] CSIR about nine years ago.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
He is giving us not just for Psoriasis,

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000
for cancer and a whole range of things, changing the whole paradigm.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
And you can see this Indian Psoriasis breakthrough

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
obtained by this reverse form of [unclear]

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
by doing things differently.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
You can see before treatment and after treatment.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
This is really getting more from less for more and more people,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
because these are all affordable treatments now.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Let me just remind you

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
of what Mahatma Gandhi had said.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
He had said, "Earth provides enough

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
to satisfy every man's need, but not every man's greed."

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
So the message he was giving us

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
was you must get more from less and less and less

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
so that you can share it for more and more people,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
not only the current generation,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
but the future generations.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
And he also said, "I would prize every invention of science

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
made for the benefit for all."

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
So he was giving you the message that you must have it for more and more people,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
not just a few people.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000
And therefore, ladies and gentlemen,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
this is the theme, getting more

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
from less for more.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
And mind you,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
it is not getting just a little more for just a little less.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
It's not about low cost.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
It's about ultra-low cost.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
You cannot say it's a mere treatment 10,000 dollars,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
but because you are poor I'll give it for 9,000.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Sorry, it doesn't work. You have to give it for 100 dollars, 200 dollars.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Is it possible? It has been made possible, by the way,

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
for certain other different reasons.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
So you are not talking about low cost, you are talking about ultra-low cost.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
You are not talking about affordability,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
you are talking about extreme affordability.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Because of the four billion people whose income is under two dollars a day.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
You're not talking exclusive innovation.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
You're talking about inclusive innovation.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
And therefore, you're not talking about incremental innovation,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
you're talking about disruptive innovation.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
The ideas have to be such

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000
that you think in completely different terms.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
And I would also add,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
it is not only getting more from less for more

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
by more and more people, the whole world working for it.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
I was very touched when I saw a breakthrough the other day.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000
You know, incubators for infants, for example.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
They're not available in Africa.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
They're not available in Indian villages.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
And infants die.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
And incubator costs 2,000 dollars.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
And there's a 25-dollar incubator

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
giving that performance that had been created.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
And by whom?

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
By young students from Standford University

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
on an extreme affordability project that they had, basically.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Their heart is in the right place, like Ratan Tata.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
It's not just innovation, compassion and passion --

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
compassion in the heart and passion in the belly.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
That's the new world that we want to create.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
And that is why the message is that of Gandhian engineering.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to end before time.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
I was also afraid of those 18 minutes.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000
I've still one and a half to go.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
The message, the final message, is this:

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
India gave a great gift to the world.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
What was that?

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
[In the] 20th century, we gave Gandhi to the world.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000
The 21st century gift,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
which is very, very important for the whole world,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
whether it is global economic meltdown,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
whether it is climate change --

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
any problem that you talk about

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
is gaining more from less for more and more --

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
not only the current generations,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000
for the future generations.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.000
And that can come only from Gandhian engineering.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
So ladies and gentlemen, I'm very happy to announce,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
this gift of the 21st century

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
to the world from India,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Gandhian engineering.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:17:00.000
(Applause)

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Lakshmi Pratury: Thank you, Dr. Mashelkar. (R.A. Mashelkar: Thank you very much.)

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
LP: A quick question for you.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Now, when you were a young boy in this school,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
what were your thoughts, like what did you think you could become?

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000
What do you think that drove you?

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Was there a vision you had? What is it that drove you?

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
RAM: I'll tell you a story that drove me, that transformed my life.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
I remember, I went to a poor school,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000
because my mother could not gather the 21 rupees,

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
that half a dollar that was required

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
within the stipulated time.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
It was [unclear] high school.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
But it was a poor school with rich teachers, honestly.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
And one of them was [unclear] who taught us physics.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
One day he took us out into the sun

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000
and tried to show us how to find

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000
the focal length of a convex lens.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
The lens was here. The piece of paper was there. He moved it up and down.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
And there was a bright spot up there.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
And then he said, "This is the focal length."

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.000
But then he held it for a little while, Lakshmi.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
And then the paper burned.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000
When the paper burned, for some reason he turned to me,

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
and he said, "Mashelkar, like this,

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
if you do not diffuse your energies,

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
if you focus your energies,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
you can achieve anything in the world."

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
That gave me a great message: focus and you can achieve.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
I said, "Whoa, science is so wonderful,

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
I have to become a scientist."

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
But more importantly, focus and you can achieve.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
And that message, very frankly,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
is valuable for society today.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
What does that focal length do?

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
It has parallel lines, which are sun rays.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000
And the property of parallel lines

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
is that they never meet.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
What does that convex lens do?

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
It makes them meet.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
This is convex lens leadership.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
You know what today's leadership is doing? Concave length.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
They divide them farther.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
So I learned the lesson

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
of convex lens leadership from that.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000
And when I was at National Chemical Laboratory [unclear].

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
When I was at Council of Scientific Industry Research --

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
40 laboratories -- when two laboratories were not talking to each other,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000
I would [unclear].

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.000
And currently I'm president of Global Research Alliance,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
60,000 scientists in nine counties, right from India to the U.S.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
I'm trying to build a global team,

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
which will look at the global grand challenges that the world is facing.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
That was the lesson. That was the inspirational moment.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000
LP: Thank you very much. (RAM: Thank you.)

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
(Applause)
