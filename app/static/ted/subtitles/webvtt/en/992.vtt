00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I'm going to talk to you

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
about power in this 21st century.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
And basically, what I'd like to tell you

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
is that power is changing,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and there are two types of changes

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I want to discuss.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
One is power transition,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
which is change of power amongst states.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And there the simple version of the message

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
is it's moving from West to East.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The other is power diffusion,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
the way power is moving

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
from all states West or East

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
to non-state actors.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Those two things

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
are the huge shifts of power

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
in our century.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And I want to tell you about them each separately

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and then how they interact

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and why, in the end, there may be some good news.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
When we talk about power transition,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
we often talk about the rise of Asia.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
It really should be called

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
the recovery or return of Asia.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
If we looked at the world

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
in 1800,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
you'd find that more than half of the world's people

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
lived in Asia

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
and they made more than half the world's product.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Now fast forward to 1900:

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
half the world's people -- more than half -- still live in Asia,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
but they're now making

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
only a fifth of the world's product.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
What happened? The Industrial Revolution,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
which meant that all of a sudden,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Europe and America

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
became the dominant center of the world.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
What we're going to see in the 21st century

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
is Asia gradually returning

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
to being more than half of the world's population

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and more than half of the world's product.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
That's important and it's an important shift.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
But let me tell you a little bit about

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
the other shift that I'm talking about,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
which is power diffusion.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
To understand power diffusion

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
put this in your mind:

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
computing and communications costs

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
have fallen a thousandfold

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
between 1970

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and the beginning of this century.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Now that's a big abstract number.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
But to make it more real,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
if the price of an automobile

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
had fallen as rapidly

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
as the price of computing power,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
you could buy a car today

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
for five dollars.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Now when the price of any technology

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
declines that dramatically,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
the barriers to entry go down.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Anybody can play in the game.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
So in 1970,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
if you wanted to communicate

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
from Oxford to Johannesburg

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
to New Delhi

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
to Brasilia

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and anywhere simultaneously,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
you could do it.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
The technology was there.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
But to be able to do it,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
you had to be very rich --

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
a government, a multinational corporation,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
maybe the Catholic Church --

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
but you had to be pretty wealthy.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Now, anybody has that capacity,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
which previously was restricted by price

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
just to a few actors.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
If they have the price of entry into an Internet cafe --

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
the last time I looked, it was something like a pound an hour --

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
and if you have Skype, it's free.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
So capabilities

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
that were once restricted

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
are now available to everyone.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And what that means

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
is not that the age of the State is over.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
The State still matters.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
But the stage is crowded.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
The State's not alone. There are many, many actors.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Some of that's good:

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Oxfam,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
a great non-governmental actor.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Some of it's bad:

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Al Qaeda, another non-governmental actor.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
But think of what it does

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
to how we think in traditional terms and concepts.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
We think in terms of war

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
and interstate war.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And you can think back to 1941

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
when the government of Japan

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
It's worth noticing

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
that a non-state actor

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
attacking the United States in 2001

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
killed more Americans

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
than the government of Japan did in 1941.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
You might think of that

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
as the privatization of war.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
So we're seeing a great change

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
in terms of diffusion of power.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Now the problem is

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
that we're not thinking about it in very innovative ways.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
So let me step back

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
and ask: what's power?

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Power is simple the ability

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
to affect others

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
to get the outcomes you want,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
and you can do it in three ways.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
You can do it with threats

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
of coercion, "sticks,"

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
you can do it with payments,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
"carrots,"

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
or you can do it by getting others

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
to want what you want.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
And that ability to get others to want what you want,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
to get the outcomes you want

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
without coercion or payment,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
is what I call soft power.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
And that soft power has been much neglected

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
and much misunderstood,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
and yet it's tremendously important.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
Indeed, if you can learn

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
to use more soft power,

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
you can save a lot

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
on carrots and sticks.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Traditionally, the way people thought about power

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
was primarily in terms of military power.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
For example, the great Oxford historian

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
who taught here at this university, A.J.P. Taylor,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
defined a great power

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
as a country able to prevail in war.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
But we need a new narrative

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
if we're to understand power in the 21st century.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
It's not just prevailing at war,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
though war still persists.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
It's not whose army wins;

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
it's also whose story wins.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And we have to think much more in terms of narratives

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
and whose narrative is going to be effective.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Now let me go back

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
to the question

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
of power transition

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
between states

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
and what's happening there.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
the narratives that we use now

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000
tend to be the rise and fall

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
of the great powers.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
And the current narrative is all about

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
the rise of China

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
and the decline of the United States.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Indeed, with the 2008 financial crisis,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
many people said this was

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
the beginning of the end of American power.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
The tectonic plates

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
of world politics were shifting.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
And president Medvedev of Russia, for example,

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
pronounced in 2008

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
this was the beginning of the end

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000
of United States power.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
But in fact,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
this metaphor of decline

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
is often very misleading.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
If you look at history, in recent history,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
you'll see the cycles of belief

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
in American decline

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000
come and go every 10 or 15 years or so.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
In 1958,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
after the Soviets put up Sputnik,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
it was "That's the end of America."

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
In 1973, with the oil embargo

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
and the closing of the gold window,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000
that was the end of America.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
In the 1980s,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
as America went through a transition in the Reagan period,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
between the rust belt economy of the midwest

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
to the Silicon Valley economy of California,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
that was the end of America.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
But in fact, what we've seen

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
is none of those were true.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Indeed, people were over-enthusiastic

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
in the early 2000s,

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
thinking America could do anything,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
which led us into some disastrous

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
foreign policy adventures,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
and now we're back to decline again.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
The moral of this story

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
is all these narratives about rise and fall and decline

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
tell us a lot more about psychology

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
than they do about reality.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
If we try to focus on the reality,

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000
then what we need to focus on

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
is what's really happening

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
in terms of China and the United States.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Goldman Sachs has projected

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
that China, the Chinese economy,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
will surpass that of the U.S.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
by 2027.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
So we've got, what,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
17 more years to go or so

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
before China's bigger.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Now someday,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
with a billion point three people getting richer,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.000
they are going to be bigger than the United States.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
But be very careful about these projections

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
such as the Goldman Sachs projection

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
as though that gives you an accurate picture

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
of power transition in this century.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Let me mention three reasons why it's too simple.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
First of all, it's a linear projection.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
You know, everything says,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
here's the growth rate of China, here's the growth rate of the U.S.,

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
here it goes -- straight line.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000
History is not linear.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
There are often bumps along the road, accidents along the way.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
The second thing is

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
that the Chinese economy

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
passes the U.S. economy in, let's say, 2030,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
which it may it,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
that will be a measure of total economic size,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
but not of per capita income --

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
won't tell you about the composition of the economy.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
China still has large areas

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
of underdevelopment

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
and per capita income is a better measure

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
of the sophistication of the economy.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
And that the Chinese won't catch up or pass the Americans

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
until somewhere in the latter part,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
after 2050, of this century.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
The other point that's worth noticing

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
is how one-dimensional

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
this projection is.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
You know, it looks at economic power

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
measured by GDP.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Doesn't tell you much about military power,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
doesn't tell you very much about soft power.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
It's all very one-dimensional.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
And also, when we think about the rise of Asia,

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
or return of Asia

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
as I called it a little bit earlier,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
it's worth remembering Asia's not one thing.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
If you're sitting in Japan,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
or in New Delhi,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
or in Hanoi,

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000
your view of the rise of China

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
is a little different than if you're sitting in Beijing.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Indeed, one of the advantages

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
that the Americans will have

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000
in terms of power in Asia

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
is all those countries

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
want an American insurance policy

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
against the rise of China.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
It's as though Mexico and Canada

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
were hostile neighbors to the United States,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
which they're not.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
So these simple projections

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
of the Goldman Sachs type

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
are not telling us what we need to know

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000
about power transition.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
But you might ask, well so what in any case?

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Why does it matter? Who cares?

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
Is this just a game

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
that diplomats and academics play?

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
The answer is it matters quite a lot.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Because, if you believe in decline

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
and you get the answers wrong on this,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
the facts, not the myths,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
you may have policies which are very dangerous.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Let me give you an example from history.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
The Peloponnesian War

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
was the great conflict

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
in which the Greek city state system

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
tore itself apart

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
two and a half millennia ago.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
What caused it?

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Thucydides, the great historian of the the Peloponnesian War,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
said it was the rise in the power of Athens

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
and the fear it created in Sparta.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Notice both halves of that explanation.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Many people argue

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
that the 21st century

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
is going to repeat the 20th century,

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
in which World War One,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
the great conflagration

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000
in which the European state system

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
tore itself apart

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000
and destroyed its centrality in the world,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
that that was caused by

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
the rise in the power of Germany

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
and the fear it created in Britain.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
So there are people who are telling us

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
this is going to be reproduced today,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
that what we're going to see

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
is the same thing now in this century.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
No, I think that's wrong.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
It's bad history.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
For one thing, Germany had surpassed Britain

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
in industrial strength by 1900.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
And as I said earlier,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
China has not passed the United States.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
But also, if you have this belief

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
and it creates a sense of fear,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
it leads to overreaction.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
And the greatest danger we have

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
of managing this power transition

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
of the shift toward the East is fear.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
To paraphrase Franklin Roosevelt

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
from a different context,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
the greatest thing we have to fear is fear itself.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
We don't have to fear the rise of China

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
or the return of Asia.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
And if we have policies

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
in which we take it

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
in that larger historical perspective,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
we're going to be able

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
to manage this process.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Let me say a word now

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
about the distribution of power

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
and how it relates to power diffusion

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000
and then pull these two types together.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
If you ask how is power distributed in the world today,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
it's distributed much like

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
a three-dimensional chess game.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Top board:

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
military power among states.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000
The United States is the only superpower,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
and it's likely to remain that way

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000
for two or three decades.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.000
China's not going to replace the U.S. on this military board.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Middle board of this three-dimensional chess game:

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
economic power among states.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Power is multi-polar.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
There are balancers --

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
the U.S., Europe,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000
China, Japan

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
can balance each other.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
The bottom board of this three-dimensional,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
the board of transnational relations,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
things that cross borders outside the control of governments,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
things like climate change, drug trade,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
financial flows,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
pandemics,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
all these things that cross borders

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
outside the control of governments,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000
there nobody's in charge.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
It makes no sense to call this unipolar

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
or multi-polar.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Power is chaotically distributed.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
And the only way you can solve these problems --

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
and this is where many greatest challenges

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
are coming in this century --

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
is through cooperation,

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
through working together,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
which means that soft power becomes more important,

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000
that ability to organize networks

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
to deal with these kinds of problems

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
and to be able to get cooperation.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Another way of putting it

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
is that as we think of power in the 21st century,

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
we want to get away from the idea

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000
that power's always zero sum --

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
my gain is your loss and vice versa.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Power can also be positive sum,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
where your gain can be my gain.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000
If China develops greater energy security

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
and greater capacity

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
to deal with its problems of carbon emissions,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
that's good for us

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
as well as good for China

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
as well as good for everybody else.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
So empowering China

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
to deal with its own problems of carbon

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
is good for everybody,

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
and it's not a zero sum, I win, you lose.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
It's one in which we can all gain.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000
So as we think about power

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
in this century,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
we want to get away from this view

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
that it's all I win, you lose.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Now I don't mean to be Pollyannaish about this.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Wars persist. Power persists.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Military power is important.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Keeping balances is important.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
All this still persists.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Hard power is there,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
and it will remain.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
But unless you learn how to mix

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
hard power with soft power

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
into strategies that I call smart power,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
you're not going to deal with the new kinds of problems

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
that we're facing.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
So the key question that we need to think about as we look at this

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000
is how do we work together

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000
to produce global public goods,

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
things from which all of us can benefit?

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
How do we define our national interests

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
so that it's not just zero sum,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
but positive sum.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
In that sense, if we define our interests,

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
for example, for the United States

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
the way Britain defined its interests in the 19th century,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000
keeping an open trading system,

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
keeping a monetary stability, keeping freedom of the seas --

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
those were good for Britain,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
they were good for others as well.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
And in the 21st century, you have to do an analog to that.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
How do we produce global public goods,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
which are good for us,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
but good for everyone at the same time?

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
And that's going to be the good news dimension

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
of what we need to think about

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
as we think of power in the 21st century.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000
There are ways to define our interests

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
in which, while protecting ourselves with hard power,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
we can organize with others in networks

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000
to produce, not only public goods,

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
but ways that will enhance our soft power.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
So if one looks at the statements

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
that have been made about this,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000
I am impressed that when Hillary Clinton

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
described the foreign policy

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
of the Obama administration,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
she said that the foreign policy of the Obama administration

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
was going to be smart power,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
as she put it, "using all the tools

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
in our foreign policy tool box."

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
And if we're going to deal

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
with these two great power shifts that I've described,

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
the power shift represented by transition among states,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
the power shift represented

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
by diffusion of power away from all states,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000
we're going to have to develop a new narrative of power

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
in which we combine hard and soft power

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
into strategies of smart power.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
And that's the good news I have. We can do that.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Thank you very much.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:54.000
