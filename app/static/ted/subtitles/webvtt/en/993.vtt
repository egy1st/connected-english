00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Sustainability represents

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
the what, the where and the how

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
of what is caught.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The who and the why are what's important to me.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I want to know the people behind my dinner choices.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I want to know how I impact them.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I want to know how they impact me.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I want to know why they fish.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
I want to know how they rely on the water's bounty

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
for their living.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Understanding all of this enables us

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
to shift our perception of seafood

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
away from a commodity

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
to an opportunity

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
to restore our ecosystem.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It allows for us to celebrate the seafood

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
that we're also so fortunate to eat.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So what do we call this?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I think we call it restorative seafood.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Where sustainability is the capacity

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
to endure and maintain,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
restorative is the ability to replenish and progress.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Restorative seafood allows for an evolving and dynamic system

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and acknowledges our relationship with the ocean

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
as a resource,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
suggesting that we engage to replenish the ocean

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and to encourage its resiliency.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
It is a more hopeful, it is a more human,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and is a more useful way of understanding our environment.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Wallet guides -- standard issue

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
by lots in the marine conservation world --

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
are very handy; they're a wonderful tool.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Green, yellow and red lists [of] seafood species.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
The association is very easy: buy green, don't buy red,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
think twice about yellow.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
But in my mind, it's really not enough

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
to just eat green list.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
We can't sustain this without the measure of our success

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
really changing the fate of the species

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
in the yellow and the red.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
But what if we eat only in the green list?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
You've got pole-caught yellowfin tuna here --

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
comes from sustainable stocks.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Pole caught -- no bycatch.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Great for fishermen. Lots of money. Supporting local economies.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
But it's a lion of the sea. It's a top predator.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
What's the context of this meal?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Am I sitting down in a steakhouse to a 16-ounce portion of this?

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Do I do this three times a week?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
I might still be in the green list,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
but I'm not doing myself, or you,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
or the oceans any favors.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
The point is that we have to have a context,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
a gauge for our actions in all this.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Example: I've heard that red wine is great for my health --

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
antioxidants and minerals -- heart healthy.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
That's great! I love red wine!

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
I'm going to drink so much of it. I'm going to be so healthy.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Well, how many bottles is it

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
before you tell me that I have a problem?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Well folks, we have a protein problem.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
We have lost this sensibility

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
when it regards our food,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and we are paying a cost.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
The problem is we are hiding that cost beneath the waves.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
We are hiding that cost

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
behind the social acceptance of expanding waistlines.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And we are hiding that cost behind monster profits.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
So the first thing about this idea of restorative seafood

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
is that it really takes into account our needs.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Restorative seafood might best be represented

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
not by Jaws, or by Flipper, or the Gordon's fisherman,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
but rather, by the Jolly Green Giant.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Vegetables:

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
they might yet save the oceans.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Well I'd like to respectfully submit

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
that broccoli green might then be the new blue.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
We must continue to eat

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
the best seafood possible, if at all.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
But we also must eat it with a ton of vegetables.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
The best part about restorative seafood though

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
is that it comes on the half-shell

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
with a bottle of Tabasco and lemon wedges.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
It comes in a five-ounce portion of tilapia

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
breaded with Dijon mustard and crispy, broiled breadcrumbs

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
and a steaming pile of pecan quinoa pilaf

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
with crunchy, grilled broccoli

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
so soft and sweet and charred and smoky on the outside

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
with just a hint of chili flake.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Whooo!

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
This is an easy sell.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
And the best part is all of those ingredients are available

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
to every family at the neighborhood Walmart.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Jamie Oliver is campaigning

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
to save America from the way we eat.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Sylvia is campaigning to save the oceans

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
from the way we eat.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
There's a pattern here.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Forget nuclear holocaust;

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
it's the fork that we have to worry about.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
We have ravaged our Earth

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
and then used the food that we've sourced

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
to handicap ourselves in more ways than one.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
So I think we have this whole eating thing wrong.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
And so I think it's time

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
we change what we expect from our food.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Sustainability is complicated

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
but dinner is a reality that we all very much understand.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
So let's start there.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
There's been a lot of movement recently in greening our food systems.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Dan Barber and Alice Waters

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
are leading passionately the green food Delicious Revolution.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
But green foods often represent

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
a way for us to disregard

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
the responsibility as eaters.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Just because it comes from a green source

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
doesn't mean we can treat it with disregard on the plate.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000
We have eco-friendly shrimp.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000
We can make them; we have that technology.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
But we can never have any eco-friendly all-you-can-eat shrimp buffet.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
It doesn't work.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Heart-healthy dinner is a very important part

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
of restorative seafood.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000
While we try to manage declining marine populations,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
the media's recommending increased consumption of seafood.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Studies say that tens of thousands

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
of American grandmothers, grandfathers, mothers and fathers

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
might be around for another birthday

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
if we included more seafood.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
That's a reward I am not willing to pass up.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
But it's not all about the seafood.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
It's about the way that we look at our plates.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
As a chef, I realize the easiest thing for me to do

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
is reduce the portion sizes on my plate.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
A couple things happened.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
I made more money.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
People started buying appetizers and salads,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
because they knew they weren't going to fill up on the entrees alone.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
People spent more time engaging in their meals,

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
engaging with each other over their meals.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
People got, in short, more of what they came there for

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
even though they got less protein.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
They got more calories over the course of a diversified meal.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
They got healthier. I made more money.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
This is great.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Environmental consideration was served with every plate,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
but it was served with a heaping mound

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
of consideration for human interests at the same time.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
One of the other things we did

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
was begin to diversify the species that we served --

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
small silverfish, anchovies, mackerel, sardines were uncommon.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Shellfish, mussels, oysters,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
clams, tilapia, char -- these were the common species.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
We were directing tastes

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
towards more resilience, more restorative options.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
This is what we need to favor.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
This is what the green list says.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
But this is also how we can actually begin to restore our environment.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
But what of those big predators,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
those fashionable species,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
that green list tuna that I was talking about earlier?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Well, if you must, I have a recipe for you.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
It pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000
so here we go.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Start with a 16-ounce portion of big fish.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Get a knife. Cut it into four portions.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Put it on four plates.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Mound up those four plates with vegetables

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
and then open up the very best bottle of Burgundy you have,

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
light the candles and celebrate it.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Celebrate the opportunity you have to eat this.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Invite your friends and neighbors over

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
and repeat once a year,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
maybe.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
I expect a lot from food.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000
I expect health

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
and joy and family and community.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
I expect that producing ingredients,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
preparing dishes and eating meals

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000
is all part of the communion of human interests.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000
I was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
And he taught me very early on

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
about the privilege that eating represents.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
I remember well the meals of my childhood.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
They were reasonable portions of protein

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
served with copious quantities of vegetables

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
and small amounts of starch, usually rice.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000
This is still how I largely eat today.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.000
I get sick when I go to steakhouses.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
I get the meat sweats.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
It's like a hangover from protein.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
It's disgusting.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000
But of all the dire news that you'll hear

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
and that you have heard about the state of our oceans,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
I have the unfortunate burden of delivering to you

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
possibly the very worst of it

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
and that is this whole time

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
your mother was right.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Eat your vegetables.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000
It's pretty straightforward.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
So what are we looking for in a meal?

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Well for health, I'm looking for wholesome ingredients

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
that are good for my body.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
For joy, I'm looking for butter and salt

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
and sexy things that make things taste less like penance.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
For family, I'm looking for recipes

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
that genuflect to my own personal histories.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
For community though, we start at the very beginning.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
There's no escaping the fact

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000
that everything we eat has a global impact.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
So try and learn as best you can what that impact is

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
and then take the first step to minimize it.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
We've seen an image of our blue planet,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
our world bank.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
But it is more than just a repository of our resources;

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000
it's also the global geography

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
of the communion we call dinner.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
So if we all take only what we need,

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
then we can begin to share the rest,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
we can begin to celebrate,

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
we can begin to restore.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
We need to savor vegetables.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
We need to savor smaller portions of seafood.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000
And we need to save dinner.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000
Thank you.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
(Applause)
