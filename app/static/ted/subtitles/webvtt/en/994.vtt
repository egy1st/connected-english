WEBVTT

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.499
I'm a bug lover, myself --

00:00:02.523 --> 00:00:04.276
not from childhood, by the way,

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.870
but rather late.

00:00:06.897 --> 00:00:08.276
When I bachelored,

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.993
majoring in zoology
at Tel Aviv University,

00:00:11.017 --> 00:00:13.154
I kind of fell in love with bugs.

00:00:13.178 --> 00:00:14.916
And then, within zoology,

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.080
I took the course
or the discipline of entomology,

00:00:18.104 --> 00:00:20.355
the science of insects.

00:00:20.744 --> 00:00:23.942
And then I thought to myself,
how can I be practical

00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:26.942
or help in the science of entomology?

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.533
And then I moved to the world
of plant protection --

00:00:30.557 --> 00:00:33.059
plant protection from insects,

00:00:33.083 --> 00:00:34.897
from bad bugs.

00:00:34.921 --> 00:00:37.276
And then within plant protection,

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.561
I came into the discipline
of biological pest control,

00:00:41.585 --> 00:00:43.275
which we actually define

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:46.276
as the use of living organisms

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.800
to reduce populations
of noxious plant pests.

00:00:50.824 --> 00:00:53.926
So it's a whole discipline
in plant protection

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.407
aimed at the reduction of chemicals.

00:00:58.196 --> 00:01:00.242
And biological pest control, by the way,

00:01:00.266 --> 00:01:03.034
or these "good bugs"
that we are talking about,

00:01:03.058 --> 00:01:06.890
they've existed in the world
for thousands and thousands of years,

00:01:06.914 --> 00:01:08.517
for a long, long time.

00:01:08.541 --> 00:01:12.123
But only in the last 120 years,

00:01:12.228 --> 00:01:15.618
people started, or people
knew more and more

00:01:15.642 --> 00:01:20.028
how to exploit, or how to use,
this biological control phenomenon,

00:01:20.052 --> 00:01:23.432
or in fact, natural control phenomenon,

00:01:23.456 --> 00:01:25.694
for their own needs.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.788
Because biological control phenomenon --
you can see it in your backyard.

00:01:29.812 --> 00:01:32.768
Just take a magnifying glass.
You see what I have here?

00:01:32.792 --> 00:01:36.806
That's a magnifier, times 10.

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.828
You just open it, twist leaves,

00:01:39.852 --> 00:01:43.276
and you see a whole new world
of minute insects,

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.276
or little spiders of one millimeter,
one-and-a-half, two millimeters long,

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.300
and you can distinguish
between the good ones and the bad ones.

00:01:51.324 --> 00:01:55.864
So this phenomenon of natural control
exists literally everywhere.

00:01:55.888 --> 00:01:57.942
Here, in front of this building, I'm sure.

00:01:57.966 --> 00:01:59.488
Just have a look at the plants.

00:01:59.905 --> 00:02:03.566
So it's everywhere,
and we need to know how to exploit it.

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:06.046
Well, let's go hand by hand

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.276
and browse through just a few examples.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.815
What is a pest?

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:14.149
What damage does it actually
inflict on the plant?

00:02:14.173 --> 00:02:16.434
And what is the natural enemy,

00:02:16.458 --> 00:02:19.441
the biological control agent,
or the "good bug"

00:02:19.465 --> 00:02:20.666
that we're talking about?

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.703
In general, I'm going to talk
about insects and spiders,

00:02:25.727 --> 00:02:27.950
or mites, let us call them.

00:02:27.974 --> 00:02:30.743
Insects, those six-legged organisms

00:02:30.767 --> 00:02:34.845
and spiders or mites,
the eight-legged organisms.

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:36.276
Let's have a look at that.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.528
Here is a devastating pest, a spider mite,

00:02:39.552 --> 00:02:42.424
because it does a lot
of webbing, like a spider.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.322
You see the mother in between,

00:02:44.346 --> 00:02:46.756
and two daughters, probably,
on the left and right,

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.848
and a single egg on the right-hand side.

00:02:48.872 --> 00:02:51.360
And then you see
what kind of damage it can inflict.

00:02:51.384 --> 00:02:53.926
On your right-hand side,
you can see a cucumber leaf,

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.391
in the middle, a cotton leaf,

00:02:55.415 --> 00:02:58.613
and on the left, a tomato leaf
with these little stipplings.

00:02:58.637 --> 00:03:01.690
They can literally turn
from green to white,

00:03:01.714 --> 00:03:07.276
because of the sucking, piercing
mouth parts of those spiders.

00:03:07.758 --> 00:03:11.428
But here comes nature,
that provides us with a good spider.

00:03:11.452 --> 00:03:14.834
This is a predatory mite --
just as small as a spider mite;

00:03:14.858 --> 00:03:17.662
one, two millimeters long,
not more than that --

00:03:17.686 --> 00:03:22.100
running quickly, hunting,
chasing the spider mites.

00:03:22.124 --> 00:03:25.992
And here, you can see this lady
in action on your left-hand side --

00:03:26.016 --> 00:03:31.642
just pierces, sucks the body fluids
on the left-hand side of the pest mite.

00:03:31.666 --> 00:03:34.276
And after five minutes,
this is what you see:

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.619
just a typical dead corpse --

00:03:36.643 --> 00:03:40.276
the shriveled, sucked-out,
dead corpse of the spider mite,

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:45.164
and next to it, two satiated
individuals, predatory mites,

00:03:45.188 --> 00:03:48.685
a mother on the left-hand side,
a young nymph on the right-hand side.

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.631
By the way, a meal for them for 24 hours,

00:03:51.655 --> 00:03:55.905
is about five of the spider mites,
of the bad mites,

00:03:55.929 --> 00:04:00.814
and-or 15 to 20 eggs of the pest mites.

00:04:00.838 --> 00:04:03.276
By the way, they are always hungry.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.539
(Laughter)

00:04:05.563 --> 00:04:07.870
And here is another example: aphids.

00:04:07.894 --> 00:04:09.748
It's springtime now in Israel.

00:04:09.772 --> 00:04:12.277
When temperatures rise sharply,

00:04:12.301 --> 00:04:15.574
you can see those bad ones,
those aphids, all over the plants --

00:04:15.598 --> 00:04:18.276
in your hibiscus, in your lantana,

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:22.276
in the young, fresh foliage
of the so-called spring flush.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.276
By the way, with aphids you have
only females, like Amazons.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.725
Females giving rise to females,
giving rise to other females.

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:30.978
No males at all.

00:04:31.002 --> 00:04:33.438
Parthenogenesis, as it's so called.

00:04:33.462 --> 00:04:35.577
And they're very happy
with that, apparently.

00:04:35.601 --> 00:04:36.626
(Laughter)

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.276
Here we can see the damage.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:45.060
Those aphids secrete a sticky,
sugary liquid called honeydew,

00:04:45.084 --> 00:04:49.103
and this just clogs
the upper parts of the plant.

00:04:49.127 --> 00:04:52.840
Here you see a typical cucumber leaf
that turned from green to black

00:04:52.864 --> 00:04:57.583
because of a black fungus, sooty mold,
which is covering it.

00:04:57.607 --> 00:05:02.935
And here comes the salvation,
through this parasitic wasp.

00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:05.061
Here we are not talking about a predator.

00:05:05.085 --> 00:05:07.549
Here we are talking a parasite --

00:05:07.573 --> 00:05:09.446
not a two-legged parasite,

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.479
but an eight-legged parasite, of course.

00:05:12.503 --> 00:05:14.277
This is a parasitic wasp,

00:05:14.301 --> 00:05:20.056
again, two millimeters long, slender,
a very quick and sharp flier.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.864
And here you can see
this parasite in action,

00:05:22.888 --> 00:05:25.555
like in an acrobatic maneuver.

00:05:25.579 --> 00:05:27.276
She stands vis-Ã -vis

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.627
in front of the victim
at the right-hand side,

00:05:29.651 --> 00:05:34.825
bending its abdomen
and inserting a single egg

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:36.956
into the body fluids of the aphid.

00:05:37.638 --> 00:05:39.795
By the way, the aphid tries to escape.

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:44.078
She kicks and bites
and secretes different liquids,

00:05:44.102 --> 00:05:46.152
but nothing will happen, in fact --

00:05:46.176 --> 00:05:49.586
only the egg of the parasitoid
will be inserted

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.748
into the body fluids of the aphid.

00:05:51.772 --> 00:05:54.708
And after a few days,
depending upon temperature,

00:05:54.732 --> 00:05:56.149
the egg will hatch

00:05:56.173 --> 00:06:01.144
and the larva of this parasite
will eat the aphid from the inside.

00:06:01.168 --> 00:06:02.219
(Laughter)

00:06:02.243 --> 00:06:04.487
This is all natural. This is all natural.

00:06:04.511 --> 00:06:06.510
This is not fiction, nothing at all.

00:06:06.534 --> 00:06:09.485
Again -- in your backyard.
In your backyard.

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:11.014
(Laughter)

00:06:11.038 --> 00:06:12.503
(Applause)

00:06:12.527 --> 00:06:18.984
But this is the end result: mummies.

00:06:19.094 --> 00:06:24.276
This is the visual result
of a dead aphid encompassing inside,

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:30.195
a developing parasitoid that,
after a few minutes, you see halfway out.

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:32.425
The birth is almost complete.

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:35.623
You can see, by the way,
in different movies, etc.,

00:06:35.647 --> 00:06:37.276
it takes just a few minutes.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.802
And if this is a female,
she'll immediately mate with a male

00:06:40.826 --> 00:06:43.662
and off she goes,
because time is very short.

00:06:43.686 --> 00:06:46.276
This female can live
only three to four days,

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.162
and she needs to give rise
to around 400 eggs.

00:06:50.186 --> 00:06:53.588
That means she has 400 bad aphids

00:06:53.612 --> 00:06:56.593
to put her eggs into their body fluids.

00:06:57.204 --> 00:06:59.180
This is, of course, not the end of it.

00:06:59.204 --> 00:07:01.586
There is a whole wealth
of other natural enemies

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.276
and this is just the last example.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.793
Again, we'll start first with the pest:

00:07:05.817 --> 00:07:07.276
the thrips.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.603
By the way, all these weird names --

00:07:09.627 --> 00:07:13.126
I didn't bother you with the Latin
names of these creatures,

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:14.390
just the popular names.

00:07:14.414 --> 00:07:18.526
But this is a nice,
slender, very bad pest.

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:20.898
If you can see this: sweet peppers.

00:07:20.922 --> 00:07:23.921
This is not just an exotic,
ornamental sweet pepper.

00:07:23.945 --> 00:07:26.492
This is a sweet pepper
which is not consumable

00:07:26.516 --> 00:07:29.276
because it is suffering
from a viral disease

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.465
transmitted by those thrip adults.

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:36.427
And here comes the natural enemy,
minute pirate bug --

00:07:36.451 --> 00:07:39.030
"minute," because it is rather small.

00:07:39.054 --> 00:07:42.473
Here you can see the adult,
black, and two young ones.

00:07:42.497 --> 00:07:44.042
And again, in action.

00:07:44.066 --> 00:07:46.877
This adult pierces the thrips,

00:07:47.614 --> 00:07:49.860
sucking it within just several minutes,

00:07:49.884 --> 00:07:53.114
going to the other prey,
continuing all over the place.

00:07:53.138 --> 00:07:57.433
And if we spread those minute
pirate bugs, the good ones,

00:07:57.457 --> 00:08:00.353
for example, in a sweet pepper plot,

00:08:00.377 --> 00:08:01.946
they go to the flowers.

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:07.054
And look -- this flower is flooded
with predatory bugs, with the good ones,

00:08:07.078 --> 00:08:10.276
after wiping out the bad ones, the thrips.

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.884
So this is a very positive situation.

00:08:12.908 --> 00:08:16.208
No harm to the developing fruit.
No harm to the fruit set.

00:08:16.232 --> 00:08:19.296
Everything is just fine
under these circumstances.

00:08:20.045 --> 00:08:21.506
But again, the question is,

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:25.731
here you saw them on a one-to-one basis --
the pest, the natural enemy.

00:08:26.097 --> 00:08:29.068
What we do is actually this.

00:08:29.544 --> 00:08:32.973
In Northeast Israel,
in Kibbutz Sde Eliyahu,

00:08:32.997 --> 00:08:37.366
there is a facility that mass-produces
those natural enemies.

00:08:37.711 --> 00:08:44.189
In other words, what we do there
is amplify the natural control,

00:08:44.213 --> 00:08:46.190
or the biological control phenomenon.

00:08:46.214 --> 00:08:51.091
And in 30,000 square meters
of state-of-the-art greenhouses,

00:08:51.115 --> 00:08:54.419
there, we are mass-producing
those predatory mites,

00:08:54.443 --> 00:08:56.138
those minute pirate bugs,

00:08:56.162 --> 00:08:59.058
those parasitic wasps, etc.

00:08:59.082 --> 00:09:00.409
Many different parts.

00:09:00.433 --> 00:09:02.689
By the way, they have
a very nice landscape --

00:09:02.713 --> 00:09:05.089
you see the Jordanian Mountains
on the one hand,

00:09:05.113 --> 00:09:07.090
and the Jordan Valley on the other hand,

00:09:07.114 --> 00:09:11.167
and a good, mild winter
and a nice, hot summer,

00:09:11.191 --> 00:09:15.186
which is an excellent condition
to mass-produce those creatures.

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:19.450
And by the way, mass-production --
it is not genetic manipulation.

00:09:19.474 --> 00:09:23.521
There are no GMOs -- genetically
modified organisms -- whatsoever.

00:09:23.545 --> 00:09:25.276
We take them from nature,

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:29.597
and the only thing that we do
is give them the optimal conditions,

00:09:29.621 --> 00:09:32.276
under the greenhouses
or in the climate rooms,

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:35.717
in order to proliferate,
multiply and reproduce.

00:09:36.367 --> 00:09:38.058
And that's what we get.

00:09:38.082 --> 00:09:39.939
You see under a microscope.

00:09:39.963 --> 00:09:43.107
You see in the upper left corner?
You see a single predatory mite.

00:09:43.131 --> 00:09:46.526
And this is the whole bunch
of predatory mites.

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:48.870
You see this ampul. You see this one.

00:09:48.894 --> 00:09:52.070
I have one gram of those predatory mites.

00:09:52.391 --> 00:09:55.939
One gram is 80,000 individuals.

00:09:56.503 --> 00:10:02.089
80,000 individuals are good enough
to control one acre,

00:10:02.113 --> 00:10:03.951
4,000 square meters,

00:10:03.975 --> 00:10:05.828
of a strawberry plot

00:10:05.852 --> 00:10:08.781
against spider mites for the whole season

00:10:08.805 --> 00:10:10.218
of almost one year.

00:10:10.982 --> 00:10:14.530
And we can produce
from this, believe you me,

00:10:14.554 --> 00:10:18.956
several dozens of kilograms
on an annual basis.

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:23.188
So this is what I call
amplification of the phenomenon.

00:10:23.212 --> 00:10:27.011
And no, we do not disrupt the balance.

00:10:27.035 --> 00:10:28.276
On the contrary,

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:31.183
because we bring it to every cultural plot

00:10:31.207 --> 00:10:33.960
where the balance was already disrupted

00:10:33.984 --> 00:10:35.276
by the chemicals.

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:37.177
Here we come with those natural enemies

00:10:37.201 --> 00:10:40.108
in order to reverse
a little bit of the wheel

00:10:40.132 --> 00:10:44.114
and to bring more natural balance
to the agricultural plot

00:10:44.138 --> 00:10:45.979
by reducing those chemicals.

00:10:46.003 --> 00:10:47.558
That's the whole idea.

00:10:47.582 --> 00:10:49.020
And what is the impact?

00:10:49.044 --> 00:10:52.276
In this table, you can
actually see what is an impact

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:56.028
of a successful biological
control by good bugs.

00:10:56.648 --> 00:11:03.017
For example, in Israel, where we employ
more than 1,000 hectares --

00:11:03.041 --> 00:11:05.716
10,000 dunams in Israeli terms --

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:08.365
of biological pests
controlling sweet pepper

00:11:08.389 --> 00:11:09.913
under protection,

00:11:09.937 --> 00:11:13.592
75 percent of the pesticides
were actually reduced.

00:11:13.616 --> 00:11:16.101
And Israeli strawberries, even more --

00:11:16.125 --> 00:11:17.899
80 percent of the pesticides,

00:11:17.923 --> 00:11:22.491
especially those aimed
against pest mites in strawberries.

00:11:22.846 --> 00:11:24.722
So the impact is very strong.

00:11:25.984 --> 00:11:28.132
And there goes the question,

00:11:28.156 --> 00:11:31.133
especially if you ask
growers, agriculturists:

00:11:31.157 --> 00:11:32.850
Why biological control?

00:11:32.874 --> 00:11:34.652
Why good bugs?

00:11:34.676 --> 00:11:37.442
By the way, the number of answers you get

00:11:37.466 --> 00:11:39.597
equals the number of people you ask.

00:11:41.054 --> 00:11:45.612
But if we go, for example,
to this place, Southeast Israel,

00:11:45.636 --> 00:11:49.112
the Arava area
above the Great Rift Valley,

00:11:49.136 --> 00:11:54.181
where the pearl of Israeli
agriculture is located,

00:11:54.205 --> 00:11:57.798
especially under greenhouse conditions,
or under screenhouse conditions --

00:11:57.822 --> 00:12:00.611
if you drive all the way
to Eilat, you see this

00:12:00.635 --> 00:12:02.548
just in the middle of the desert.

00:12:02.572 --> 00:12:04.081
And if you zoom in,

00:12:04.105 --> 00:12:05.808
you can definitely watch this:

00:12:06.196 --> 00:12:08.383
grandparents with their grandchildren,

00:12:08.407 --> 00:12:11.276
distributing the natural
enemies, the good bugs,

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:13.673
instead of wearing special clothes

00:12:13.697 --> 00:12:15.897
and gas masks and applying chemicals.

00:12:16.485 --> 00:12:19.071
So safety, with respect
to the application,

00:12:19.095 --> 00:12:22.514
is the number one answer
that we get from growers,

00:12:22.538 --> 00:12:24.511
for "Why biological control?"

00:12:25.689 --> 00:12:29.659
Number two, many growers
are, in fact, petrified

00:12:29.683 --> 00:12:32.866
by the idea of resistance,

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:37.443
that the pests will become
resistant to the chemicals,

00:12:37.467 --> 00:12:41.276
just like in our case, that bacteria
becomes resistant to antibiotics.

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:44.068
It's the same, and it can
happen very quickly.

00:12:44.908 --> 00:12:49.276
Fortunately, in either biological control
or even natural control,

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:52.361
resistance is extremely rare.

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:54.489
It hardly happens.

00:12:54.513 --> 00:12:57.865
Because this is evolution,
this is the natural ratio,

00:12:57.889 --> 00:13:01.743
unlike resistance, which happens
in the case of chemicals.

00:13:01.767 --> 00:13:04.743
And thirdly, public demand.

00:13:05.236 --> 00:13:10.040
The more the public demands
the reduction of chemicals,

00:13:10.064 --> 00:13:13.909
the more growers become aware of the fact

00:13:13.933 --> 00:13:16.675
that they should, wherever they can
and wherever possible,

00:13:16.699 --> 00:13:20.630
replace the chemical control
with biological control.

00:13:20.734 --> 00:13:22.796
Even here, there is another grower,

00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:26.547
you see, very interested in the bugs,
the bad ones and the good ones,

00:13:26.571 --> 00:13:28.766
wearing this magnifier
already on her head,

00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:31.199
just walking safely in her crop.

00:13:31.867 --> 00:13:35.127
Finally, I want to get to my vision,

00:13:35.151 --> 00:13:37.103
or, in fact, to my dream.

00:13:37.611 --> 00:13:39.634
Because, you see, this is the reality.

00:13:39.658 --> 00:13:41.134
Have a look at the gap.

00:13:41.158 --> 00:13:43.276
If we take the overall turnover

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:45.745
of the biocontrol industry worldwide,

00:13:45.769 --> 00:13:47.643
it's 250 million dollars.

00:13:48.762 --> 00:13:51.856
And look at the overall pesticide industry

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:53.734
in all the crops throughout the world.

00:13:54.077 --> 00:13:56.948
I think it's times 100
or something like that.

00:13:56.972 --> 00:13:58.678
Twenty-five billion.

00:13:58.702 --> 00:14:01.317
So there is a huge gap to bridge.

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.964
So actually, how can we do it?

00:14:03.988 --> 00:14:08.868
How can we bridge, or let's say,
narrow, this gap over the years?

00:14:08.892 --> 00:14:12.640
First of all, we need to find more robust,

00:14:12.664 --> 00:14:15.276
good and reliable biological solutions,

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:19.923
more good bugs that we can
either mass-produce

00:14:19.947 --> 00:14:22.451
or actually conserve in the field.

00:14:23.013 --> 00:14:27.599
Secondly, to create even more intensive
and strict public demand

00:14:27.623 --> 00:14:30.875
for the reduction of chemicals
in agricultural fresh produce.

00:14:31.716 --> 00:14:35.474
And thirdly, also to increase
awareness by the growers

00:14:35.498 --> 00:14:37.649
to the potential of this industry.

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:40.799
And this gap really narrows.

00:14:40.823 --> 00:14:43.438
Step by step, it does narrow.

00:14:44.557 --> 00:14:46.762
So I think my last slide is:

00:14:46.786 --> 00:14:49.051
All we are saying --
we can actually sing it --

00:14:49.075 --> 00:14:50.869
Give nature a chance.

00:14:50.893 --> 00:14:54.059
I'm saying it on behalf
of all the biocontrol practitioners

00:14:54.083 --> 00:14:55.397
and implementers,

00:14:55.421 --> 00:14:57.642
in Israel and abroad,

00:14:57.666 --> 00:14:59.698
really give nature a chance.

00:14:59.722 --> 00:15:00.881
Thank you.

00:15:00.905 --> 00:15:02.976
(Applause)
