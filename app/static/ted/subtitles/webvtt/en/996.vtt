00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I love video games.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I'm also slightly in awe of them.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
I'm in awe of their power

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
in terms of imagination, in terms of technology,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
in terms of concept.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
But I think, above all,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I'm in awe at their power

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
to motivate, to compel us,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
to transfix us,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
like really nothing else we've ever invented

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
has quite done before.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And I think that we can learn some pretty amazing things

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
by looking at how we do this.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
And in particular, I think we can learn things

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
about learning.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Now the video games industry

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
is far and away the fastest growing

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
of all modern media.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
From about 10 billion in 1990,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
it's worth 50 billion dollars globally today,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and it shows no sign of slowing down.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
In four years' time,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
it's estimated it'll be worth over 80 billion dollars.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
That's about three times the recorded music industry.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
This is pretty stunning,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
but I don't think it's the most telling statistic of all.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The thing that really amazes me

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
is that, today,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
people spend about

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
eight billion real dollars a year

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
buying virtual items

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
that only exist

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
inside video games.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
This is a screenshot from the virtual game world, Entropia Universe.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Earlier this year,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
a virtual asteroid in it

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
sold for 330,000 real dollars.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And this

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
is a Titan class ship

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
in the space game, EVE Online.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And this virtual object

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
takes 200 real people

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
about 56 days of real time to build,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
plus countless thousands of hours

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
of effort before that.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And yet, many of these get built.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
At the other end of the scale,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
the game Farmville that you may well have heard of,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
has 70 million players

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
around the world

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
and most of these players

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
are playing it almost every day.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
This may all sound

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
really quite alarming to some people,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
an index of something worrying

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
or wrong in society.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
But we're here for the good news,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and the good news is

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
that I think we can explore

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
why this very real human effort,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
this very intense generation of value, is occurring.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And by answering that question,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I think we can take something

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
extremely powerful away.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
And I think the most interesting way

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
to think about how all this is going on

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
is in terms of rewards.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And specifically, it's in terms

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
of the very intense emotional rewards

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
that playing games offers to people

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
both individually

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
and collectively.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Now if we look at what's going on in someone's head

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
when they are being engaged,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
two quite different processes are occurring.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
On the one hand, there's the wanting processes.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
This is a bit like ambition and drive -- I'm going to do that. I'm going to work hard.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
On the other hand, there's the liking processes,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
fun and affection

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
and delight

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
and an enormous flying beast with an orc on the back.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
It's a really great image. It's pretty cool.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
It's from the game World of Warcraft with more than 10 million players globally,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
one of whom is me, another of whom is my wife.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
And this kind of a world,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
this vast flying beast you can ride around,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
shows why games are so very good

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
at doing both the wanting and the liking.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Because it's very powerful. It's pretty awesome.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
It gives you great powers.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Your ambition is satisfied, but it's very beautiful.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
It's a very great pleasure to fly around.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And so these combine to form

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
a very intense emotional engagement.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
But this isn't the really interesting stuff.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
The really interesting stuff about virtuality

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
is what you can measure with it.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Because what you can measure in virtuality

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
is everything.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Every single thing that every single person

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
who's ever played in a game has ever done can be measured.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
The biggest games in the world today

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
are measuring more than one billion points of data

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
about their players, about what everybody does --

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
far more detail than you'd ever get from any website.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
And this allows something very special

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
to happen in games.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
It's something called the reward schedule.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
And by this, I mean looking

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
at what millions upon millions of people have done

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
and carefully calibrating the rate,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
the nature, the type, the intensity of rewards in games

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
to keep them engaged

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
over staggering amounts of time and effort.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Now, to try and explain this

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
in sort of real terms,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000
I want to talk about a kind of task

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
that might fall to you in so many games.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Go and get a certain amount of a certain little game-y item.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Let's say, for the sake of argument,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
my mission is to get 15 pies

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
and I can get 15 pies

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
by killing these cute, little monsters.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Simple game quest.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Now you can think about this, if you like,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000
as a problem about boxes.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
I've got to keep opening boxes.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
I don't know what's inside them until I open them.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
And I go around opening box after box until I've got 15 pies.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Now, if you take a game like Warcraft,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
you can think about it, if you like,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
as a great box-opening effort.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
The game's just trying to get people to open about a million boxes,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
getting better and better stuff in them.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
This sounds immensely boring

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
but games are able

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
to make this process

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
incredibly compelling.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
And the way they do this

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000
is through a combination of probability and data.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Let's think about probability.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
If we want to engage someone

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
in the process of opening boxes to try and find pies,

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
we want to make sure it's neither too easy,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
nor too difficult, to find a pie.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
So what do you do? Well, you look at a million people --

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
no, 100 million people, 100 million box openers --

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
and you work out, if you make the pie rate

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000
about 25 percent --

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000
that's neither too frustrating, nor too easy.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
It keeps people engaged.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
But of course, that's not all you do -- there's 15 pies.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Now, I could make a game called Piecraft,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
where all you had to do was get a million pies

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
or a thousand pies.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
That would be very boring.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Fifteen is a pretty optimal number.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000
You find that -- you know, between five and 20

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
is about the right number for keeping people going.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
But we don't just have pies in the boxes.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
There's 100 percent up here.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
And what we do is make sure that every time a box is opened,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
there's something in it, some little reward

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
that keeps people progressing and engaged.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
In most adventure games,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
it's a little bit in-game currency, a little bit experience.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
But we don't just do that either.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
We also say there's going to be loads of other items

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
of varying qualities and levels of excitement.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
There's going to be a 10 percent chance you get a pretty good item.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
There's going to be a 0.1 percent chance

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
you get an absolutely awesome item.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And each of these rewards is carefully calibrated to the item.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
And also, we say,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.000
"Well, how many monsters? Should I have the entire world full of a billion monsters?"

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
No, we want one or two monsters on the screen at any one time.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
So I'm drawn on. It's not too easy, not too difficult.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
So all this is very powerful.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
But we're in virtuality. These aren't real boxes.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
So we can do

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
some rather amazing things.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000
We notice, looking at all these people opening boxes,

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
that when people get to about 13 out of 15 pies,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
their perception shifts, they start to get a bit bored, a bit testy.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
They're not rational about probability.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
They think this game is unfair.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
It's not giving me my last two pies. I'm going to give up.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
If they're real boxes, there's not much we can do,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
but in a game we can just say, "Right, well.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000
When you get to 13 pies, you've got 75 percent chance of getting a pie now."

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Keep you engaged. Look at what people do --

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000
adjust the world to match their expectation.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Our games don't always do this.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And one thing they certainly do at the moment

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
is if you got a 0.1 percent awesome item,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
they make very sure another one doesn't appear for a certain length of time

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
to keep the value, to keep it special.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000
And the point is really

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
that we evolved to be satisfied by the world

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
in particular ways.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Over tens and hundreds of thousands of years,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
we evolved to find certain things stimulating,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
and as very intelligent, civilized beings,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
we're enormously stimulated by problem solving and learning.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
But now, we can reverse engineer that

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
and build worlds

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000
that expressly tick our evolutionary boxes.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
So what does all this mean in practice?

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Well, I've come up

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
with seven things

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
that, I think, show

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
how you can take these lessons from games

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
and use them outside of games.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
The first one is very simple:

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000
experience bars measuring progress --

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
something that's been talked about brilliantly

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000
by people like Jesse Schell earlier this year.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
It's already been done at the University of Indiana in the States, among other places.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
It's the simple idea that instead of grading people incrementally

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
in little bits and pieces,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.000
you give them one profile character avatar

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
which is constantly progressing

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
in tiny, tiny, tiny little increments which they feel are their own.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
And everything comes towards that,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
and they watch it creeping up, and they own that as it goes along.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Second, multiple long and short-term aims --

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
5,000 pies, boring,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
15 pies, interesting.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
So, you give people

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
lots and lots of different tasks.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
You say, it's about

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
doing 10 of these questions,

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
but another task

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
is turning up to 20 classes on time,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
but another task is collaborating with other people,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
another task is showing you're working five times,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
another task is hitting this particular target.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
You break things down into these calibrated slices

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
that people can choose and do in parallel

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
to keep them engaged

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
and that you can use to point them

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
towards individually beneficial activities.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Third, you reward effort.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000
It's your 100 percent factor. Games are brilliant at this.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Every time you do something, you get credit; you get a credit for trying.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000
You don't punish failure. You reward every little bit of effort --

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000
a little bit of gold, a little bit of credit. You've done 20 questions -- tick.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
It all feeds in as minute reinforcement.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Fourth, feedback.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
This is absolutely crucial,

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000
and virtuality is dazzling at delivering this.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
If you look at some of the most intractable problems in the world today

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
that we've been hearing amazing things about,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
it's very, very hard for people to learn

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
if they cannot link consequences to actions.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Pollution, global warming, these things --

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
the consequences are distant in time and space.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
It's very hard to learn, to feel a lesson.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
But if you can model things for people,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
if you can give things to people that they can manipulate

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
and play with and where the feedback comes,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
then they can learn a lesson, they can see,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
they can move on, they can understand.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
And fifth,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000
the element of uncertainty.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Now this is the neurological goldmine,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
if you like,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
because a known reward

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000
excites people,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
but what really gets them going

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
is the uncertain reward,

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
the reward pitched at the right level of uncertainty,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
that they didn't quite know whether they were going to get it or not.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
The 25 percent. This lights the brain up.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
And if you think about

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
using this in testing,

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000
in just introducing control elements of randomness

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
in all forms of testing and training,

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
you can transform the levels of people's engagement

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
by tapping into this very powerful

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
evolutionary mechanism.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000
When we don't quite predict something perfectly,

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
we get really excited about it.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000
We just want to go back and find out more.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
As you probably know, the neurotransmitter

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
associated with learning is called dopamine.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
It's associated with reward-seeking behavior.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000
And something very exciting is just beginning to happen

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
in places like the University of Bristol in the U.K.,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
where we are beginning to be able to model mathematically

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
dopamine levels in the brain.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000
And what this means is we can predict learning,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
we can predict enhanced engagement,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
these windows, these windows of time,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
in which the learning is taking place at an enhanced level.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
And two things really flow from this.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
The first has to do with memory,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
that we can find these moments.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
When someone is more likely to remember,

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
we can give them a nugget in a window.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
And the second thing is confidence,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
that we can see how game-playing and reward structures

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
make people braver, make them more willing to take risks,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
more willing to take on difficulty,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
harder to discourage.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
This can all seem very sinister.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
But you know, sort of "our brains have been manipulated; we're all addicts."

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000
The word "addiction" is thrown around.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
There are real concerns there.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
But the biggest neurological turn-on for people

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
is other people.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
This is what really excites us.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
In reward terms, it's not money;

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
it's not being given cash -- that's nice --

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
it's doing stuff with our peers,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
watching us, collaborating with us.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
And I want to tell you a quick story about 1999 --

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
a video game called EverQuest.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000
And in this video game,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
there were two really big dragons, and you had to team up to kill them --

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
42 people, up to 42 to kill these big dragons.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
That's a problem

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000
because they dropped two or three decent items.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
So players addressed this problem

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
by spontaneously coming up with a system

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
to motivate each other,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
fairly and transparently.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
What happened was, they paid each other a virtual currency

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
they called "dragon kill points."

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
And every time you turned up to go on a mission,

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
you got paid in dragon kill points.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
They tracked these on a separate website.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
So they tracked their own private currency,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
and then players could bid afterwards

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000
for cool items they wanted --

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
all organized by the players themselves.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Now the staggering system, not just that this worked in EverQuest,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
but that today, a decade on,

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
every single video game in the world with this kind of task

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000
uses a version of this system --

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000
tens of millions of people.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
And the success rate

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
is at close to 100 percent.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
This is a player-developed,

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000
self-enforcing, voluntary currency,

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
and it's incredibly sophisticated

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
player behavior.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
And I just want to end by suggesting

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
a few ways in which these principles

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
could fan out into the world.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Let's start with business.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
I mean, we're beginning to see some of the big problems

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
around something like business are

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
recycling and energy conservation.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000
We're beginning to see the emergence of wonderful technologies

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
like real-time energy meters.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.000
And I just look at this, and I think, yes,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
we could take that so much further

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
by allowing people to set targets

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
by setting calibrated targets,

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
by using elements of uncertainty,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
by using these multiple targets,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000
by using a grand, underlying reward and incentive system,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
by setting people up

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
to collaborate in terms of groups, in terms of streets

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
to collaborate and compete,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
to use these very sophisticated

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
group and motivational mechanics we see.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
In terms of education,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
perhaps most obviously of all,

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
we can transform how we engage people.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000
We can offer people the grand continuity

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
of experience and personal investment.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
We can break things down

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
into highly calibrated small tasks.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000
We can use calculated randomness.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000
We can reward effort consistently

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
as everything fields together.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
And we can use the kind of group behaviors

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
that we see evolving when people are at play together,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
these really quite unprecedentedly complex

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.000
cooperative mechanisms.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Government, well, one thing that comes to mind

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
is the U.S. government, among others,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
is literally starting to pay people

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
to lose weight.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
So we're seeing financial reward being used

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000
to tackle the great issue of obesity.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
But again, those rewards

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000
could be calibrated so precisely

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
if we were able to use the vast expertise

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
of gaming systems to just jack up that appeal,

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
to take the data, to take the observations,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000
of millions of human hours

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
and plow that feedback

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
into increasing engagement.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000
And in the end, it's this word, "engagement,"

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
that I want to leave you with.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
It's about how individual engagement

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.000
can be transformed

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
by the psychological and the neurological lessons

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
we can learn from watching people that are playing games.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
But it's also about collective engagement

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
and about the unprecedented laboratory

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
for observing what makes people tick

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
and work and play and engage

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
on a grand scale in games.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
And if we can look at these things and learn from them

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000
and see how to turn them outwards,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
then I really think we have something quite revolutionary on our hands.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Thank you very much.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
(Applause)
