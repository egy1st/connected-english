00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
So there are a few things

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
that bring us humans together in the way that an election does.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
We stand in elections; we vote in elections;

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
we observe elections.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Our democracies rely on elections.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We all understand why we have elections,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and we all leave the house on the same day

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
to go and vote.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We cherish the opportunity to have our say,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
to help decide the future of the country.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The fundamental idea is that politicians

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
are given mandate to speak for us,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
to make decisions on our behalf

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
that affect us all.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Without that mandate, they would be corrupt.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Well unfortunately, power corrupts,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
and so people will do lots of things

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
to get power and to stay in power,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
including doing bad things to elections.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
You see, even if the idea

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
of the election is perfect,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
running a countrywide election is a big project,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and big projects are messy.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Whenever there is an election,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
it seems like something always goes wrong,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
someone tries to cheat,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
or something goes accidentally awry --

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
a ballot box goes missing here,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
chads are left hanging over here.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
To make sure as few things as possible go wrong,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
we have all these procedures around the election.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
So for example, you come to the polling station,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
and a poll station worker asks for your ID

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
before giving you a ballot form

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and asking you to go into a voting booth

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
to fill out your vote.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
When you come back out, you get to drop your vote

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
into the ballot box

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
where it mixes with all the other votes,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
so that no one knows how you voted.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Well, what I want us to think about for a moment

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
is what happens after that,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
after you drop your vote into the ballot box.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
And most people would go home

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
and feel sure that their vote has been counted,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
because they trust

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
that the election system works.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
They trust that election workers and election observers

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
do their jobs and do their jobs correctly.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
The ballot boxes go to counting places.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
They're unsealed and the votes are poured out

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and laboriously counted.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Most of us have to trust

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
that that happens correctly for our own vote,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
and we all have to trust that that happens correctly

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
for all the votes in the election.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
So we have to trust a lot of people.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
We have to trust a lot of procedures.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
And sometimes we even have to trust computers.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
So imagine hundreds of millions of voters

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
casting hundreds of millions of votes,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
all to be counted correctly

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
and all the things that can possibly go wrong

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
causing all these bad headlines,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and you cannot help but feel exhausted at the idea

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
of trying to make elections better.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Well in the face of all these bad headlines,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
researchers have taken a step back

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
and thought about how we can do elections differently.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
They've zoomed out and looked at the big picture.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
And the big picture is this:

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
elections should be verifiable.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Voters should be able to check

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
that their votes are counted correctly,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
without breaking election secrecy,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
which is so very important.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
And that's the tough part.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
How do we make an election system completely verifiable

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
while keeping the votes

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
absolutely secret?

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Well, the way we've come up with

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
uses computers

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
but doesn't depend on them.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And the secret is the ballot form.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
And if you look closely at these ballot forms,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
you'll notice that the candidate list

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
is in a different order on each one.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And that means, if you mark your choices on one of them

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
and then remove the candidate list,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
I won't be able to tell from the bit remaining

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
what your vote is for.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
And on each ballot form there is this encrypted value

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
in the form of this 2D barcode

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
on the right.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
And there's some complicated cryptography

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000
going on in there,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
but what's not complicated

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
is voting with one of these forms.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
So we can let computers do all the complicated cryptography for us,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
and then we'll use the paper for verification.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
So this is how you vote.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000
You get one of these ballot forms at random,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
and then you go into the voting booth,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
and you mark your choices,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
and you tear along a perforation.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
And you shred the candidate list.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000
And the bit that remains, the one with your marks --

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
this is your encrypted vote.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
So you let a poll station worker

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
scan your encrypted vote.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
And because it's encrypted,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
it can be submitted, stored

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
and counted centrally

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
and displayed on a website

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
for anyone to see, including you.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
So you take this encrypted vote

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
home as your receipt.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000
And after the close of the election,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000
you can check that your vote was counted

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
by comparing your receipt

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
to the vote on the website.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
And remember, the vote is encrypted

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
from the moment you leave the voting booth,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
so if an election official wants to find out how you voted,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
they will not be able to.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
If the government wants to find out how you voted,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
they won't be able to.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
No hacker can break in

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
and find out how you voted.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
No hacker can break in and change your vote,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
because then it won't match your receipt.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Votes can't go missing

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000
because then you won't find yours when you look for it.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
But the election magic doesn't stop there.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Instead, we want to make the whole process

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
so transparent

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
that news media and international observers

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
and anyone who wants to

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000
can download all the election data

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.000
and do the count themselves.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
They can check that all the votes were counted correctly.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
They can check

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
that the announced result of the election

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
is the correct one.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.000
And these are elections

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
by the people, for the people.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
So the next step for our democracies

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
are transparent

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
and verifiable elections.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Thank you.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.000
(Applause)
