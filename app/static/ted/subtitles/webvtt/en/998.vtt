00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I guess the story actually has to start

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
maybe back in the the 1960s,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
when I was seven or eight years old,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
watching Jacques Cousteau documentaries on the living room floor

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
with my mask and flippers on.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Then after every episode, I had to go up to the bathtub

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and swim around the bathtub and look at the drain,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
because that's all there was to look at.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And by the time I turned 16,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
I pursued a career in marine science,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
in exploration and diving,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and lived in underwater habitats, like this one off the Florida Keys,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
for 30 days total.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Brian Skerry took this shot. Thanks, Brian.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And I've dived in deep-sea submersibles around the world.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
And this one is the deepest diving submarine in the world,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
operated by the Japanese government.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And Sylvia Earle and I

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
were on an expedition in this submarine

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
20 years ago in Japan.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And on my dive, I went down 18,000 feet,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
to an area that I thought

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
would be pristine wilderness area on the sea floor.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
But when I got there, I found

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
lots of plastic garbage and other debris.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And it was really a turning point in my life,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
where I started to realize

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
that I couldn't just go have fun doing science and exploration.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
I needed to put it into a context.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I needed to head towards conservation goals.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
So I began to work

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
with National Geographic Society and others

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and led expeditions to Antarctica.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I led three diving expeditions to Antarctica.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Ten years ago was a seminal trip,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
where we explored that big iceberg, B-15,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
the largest iceberg in history, that broke off the Ross Ice Shelf.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And we developed techniques

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
to dive inside and under the iceberg,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
such as heating pads on our kidneys

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
with a battery that we dragged around,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
so that, as the blood flowed through our kidneys,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
it would get a little boost of warmth

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
before going back into our bodies.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
But after three trips to Antarctica,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
I decided that it might be nicer to work in warmer water.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And that same year, 10 years ago,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I headed north to the Phoenix Islands.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And I'm going to tell you that story here in a moment.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
But before I do, I just want you to ponder this graph for a moment.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
You may have seen this in other forms,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
but the top line is the amount of protected area

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
on land, globally,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and it's about 12 percent.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
And you can see that it kind of hockey sticks up

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
around the 1960s and '70s,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and it's on kind of a nice trajectory right now.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
And that's probably because

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
that's when everybody got aware of the environment

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
and Earth Day

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and all the stuff that happened in the '60s with the Hippies and everything

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
really did, I think, have an affect on global awareness.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000
But the ocean-protected area

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
is basically flat line

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
until right about now -- it appears to be ticking up.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And I do believe that we are at the hockey stick point

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
of the protected area in the ocean.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I think we would have gotten there a lot earlier

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
if we could see what happens in the ocean

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
like we can see what happens on land.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
But unfortunately, the ocean is opaque,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and we can't see what's going on.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And therefore we're way behind on protection.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
But scuba diving, submersibles

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and all the work that we're setting about to do here

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
will help rectify that.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
So where are the Phoenix Islands?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
They were the world's largest marine-protected area

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
up until last week

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
when the Chagos Archipelago was declared.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
It's in the mid-Pacific. It's about five days from anywhere.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
If you want to get to the Phoenix Islands,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
it's five days from Fiji,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
it's five days from Hawaii, it's five days from Samoa.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
It's out in the middle of the Pacific,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
right around the Equator.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I had never heard of the islands 10 years ago,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
nor the country, Kiribati, that owns them,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
till two friends of mine who run a liveaboard dive boat in Fiji

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
said, "Greg, would you lead a scientific expedition up to these islands?

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
They've never been dived."

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
And I said, "Yeah.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
But tell me where they are and the country that owns them."

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
So that's when I first learned of the Islands

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
and had no idea what I was getting into.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
But I was in for the adventure.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Let me give you a little peek here of the Phoenix Islands-protected area.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
It's a very deep-water part of our planet.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
The average depths are about 12,000 ft.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
There's lots of seamounts in the Phoenix Islands,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
which are specifically part of the protected area.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Seamounts are important for biodiversity.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
There's actually more mountains in the ocean than there are on land.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
It's an interesting fact.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
And the Phoenix Islands is very rich in those seamounts.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
So it's a deep -- think about it in a big three-dimensional space,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
very deep three-dimensional space

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
with herds of tuna, whales,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
all kinds of deep sea marine life

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
like we've seen here before.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
That's the vessel that we took up there

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
for these studies, early on,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and that's what the Islands look like -- you can see in the background.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
They're very low to the water,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
and they're all uninhabited, except one island

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
has about 35 caretakers on it.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
And they've been uninhabited for most of time

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
because even in the ancient days,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
these islands were too far away

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
from the bright lights of Fiji and Hawaii and Tahiti

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
for those ancient Polynesian mariners

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
that were traversing the Pacific so widely.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
But we got up there,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
and I had the unique and wonderful scientific opportunity and personal opportunity

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
to get to a place that had never been dived

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
and just get to an island and go, "Okay, where are we going to dive?

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Let's try there,"

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
and then falling into the water.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Both my personal and my professional life changed.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Suddenly, I saw a world

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
that I had never seen before in the ocean --

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
schools of fish that were so dense

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
they dulled the penetration of sunlight from the surface,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
coral reefs that were continuous

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
and solid and colorful,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
large fish everywhere,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
manta rays.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
It was an ecosystem. Parrotfish spawning --

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
this is about 5,000 longnose parrotfish spawning

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
at the entrance to one of the Phoenix Islands.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
You can see the fish are balled up

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
and then there's a little cloudy area there

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
where they're exchanging the eggs and sperm for reproduction --

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000
events that the ocean is supposed to do,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000
but struggles to do in many places now

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
because of human activity.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
The Phoenix Islands and all the equatorial parts of our planet

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
are very important for tuna fisheries,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
especially this yellowfin tuna that you see here.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Phoenix Islands is a major tuna location.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
And sharks -- we had sharks on our early dives,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
up to 150 sharks at once,

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
which is an indication

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000
of a very, very healthy, very strong, system.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
So I thought the scenes

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
of never-ending wilderness

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
would go on forever,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
but they did finally come to an end.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
And we explored the surface of the Islands as well --

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
very important bird nesting site,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
some of the most important bird-nesting sites in the Pacific, in the world.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
And we finished our trip.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
And that's the area again.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000
You can see the Islands -- there are eight islands --

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000
that pop out of the water.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
The peaks that don't come out of the water are the seamounts.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Remember, a seamount turns into an island when it hits the surface.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
And what's the context of the Phoenix Islands?

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Where do these exist?

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Well they exist in the Republic of Kiribati,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
and Kiribati is located in the Central Pacific

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
in three island groups.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
In the west we have the Gilbert Islands.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
In the center we have the Phoenix Islands,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
which is the subject that I'm talking about.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
And then over to the east we have the Line Islands.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000
It's the largest atoll nation in the world.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
And they have

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000
about 110,000 people

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
spread out over 33 islands.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
They control 3.4 million cubic miles of ocean,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
and that's between one and two percent

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
of all the ocean water on the planet.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
And when I was first going up there,

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000
I barely knew the name of this country 10 years ago,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
and people would ask me,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
"Why are you going to this place called Kiribati?"

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
And it reminded me of that old joke

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
where the bank robber comes out of the courthouse handcuffed,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
and the reporter yells, "Hey, Willy. Why do you rob banks?"

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
And he says, "cause that's where all the money is."

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
And I would tell people, "Why do I go to Kiribati?

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Because that's where all the ocean is."

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000
They basically are one nation

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
that controls most of the equatorial waters

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
of the Central Pacific Ocean.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000
They're also a country

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
that is in dire danger.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Sea levels are rising,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
and Kiribati, along with 42 other nations in the world,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000
will be under water within 50 to 100 years

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
due to climate change

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
and the associated sea-level rise from thermal expansion

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
and the melting of freshwater into the ocean.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.000
The Islands rise only one to two meters

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
above the surface.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Some of the islands have already gone under water.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
And these nations are faced with a real problem.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
We as a world are faced with a problem.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
What do we do with displaced fellow Earthlings

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
who no longer have a home on the planet?

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
The president of the Maldives

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
conducted a mock cabinet meeting

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000
underwater recently

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
to highlight the dire straits of these countries.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
So it's something we need to focus on.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
But back to the Phoenix Islands,

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
which is the subject of this Talk.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
After I got back, I said,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
okay, this is amazing, what we found.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
I'd like to go back and share it with the government of Kiribati,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
who are over in Tarawa,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
the westernmost group.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
So I started contacting them --

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
because they had actually given me a permit to do this --

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
and I said, "I want to come up and tell you what we found."

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And for some reason they didn't want me to come,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000
or it was hard to find a time and a place, and it took a while,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
but finally they said, "Okay, you can come.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
But if you come, you have to buy lunch

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
for everybody who comes to the seminar."

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
So I said, "Okay, I'm happy to buy lunch.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Just get whatever anybody wants."

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
So David Obura, a coral reef biologist, and I went to Tarawa,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
and we presented for two hours

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
on the amazing findings of the Phoenix Islands.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
And the country never knew this. They never had any data from this area.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
They'd never had any information from the Phoenix Islands.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
After the talk, the Minister of Fisheries walked up to me

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000
and he said, "Greg, do you realize

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
that you are the first scientist

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
who has ever come back

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
and told us what they did?"

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
He said, "We often issue these permits

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
to do research in our waters,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
but usually we get a note two or three years later,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
or a reprint.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
But you're the first one who's ever come back and told us what you did.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
And we really appreciate that. And we're buying you lunch today.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
And are you free for dinner?"

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
And I was free for dinner,

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
and I went out to dinner with the Minister of Fisheries in Kiribati.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
And over the course of dinner,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
I learned that Kiribati gains most of its revenue --

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
it's a very poor country --

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
but it gains what revenue is has

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000
by selling access to foreign nations

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
to take fish out of its waters,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
because Kiribati does not have the capacity

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
to take the fish itself.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
And the deal that they strike

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
is the extracting country

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
gives Kiribati five percent

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
of the landed value.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
So if the United States

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
removes a million dollars'

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
worth of lobsters from a reef,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Kiribati gets 50,000 dollars.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
And, you know, it didn't seem like a very good deal to me.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000
So I asked the Minister over dinner,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000
I said, "Would you consider a situation

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000
where you would still get paid --

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
we do the math and figure out what the value of the resource is --

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000
but you leave fish and the sharks

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
and the shrimp in the water?"

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
He stopped, and he said, "Yes, we would like to do that

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
to deal with our overfishing problem,

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000
and I think we would call it a reverse fishing license."

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000
He coined the term "reverse fishing license."

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
So I said, "Yes, a 'reverse fishing license.'"

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
So we walked away from this dinner

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
really not knowing where to go at that point.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
I went back to the States and started looking around

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
to see if I could find examples

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
where reverse fishing licenses

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
had been issued,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
and it turned out there were none.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
There were no oceanic deals

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
where countries were compensated for not fishing.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
It had occurred on land,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
in rainforests of South America and Africa,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
where landowners had been paid

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
not to cut the trees down.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
And Conservation International had struck some of those deals.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000
So I went to Conservation International

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
and brought them in as a partner

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
and went through the process

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
of valuing the fishery resource,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
deciding how much Kiribati should be compensated,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
what the range of the fishes were,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
brought in a whole bunch of other partners --

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
the government of Australia,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
the government of New Zealand, the World Bank.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
The Oak Foundation and National Geographic

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
have been big funders of this as well.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
And we basically founded the park

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
on the idea of an endowment

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000
that would pay the equivalent lost fishing license fees

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
to this very poor country

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
to keep the area intact.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Halfway through this process, I met the president of Kiribati,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000
President Anote Tong.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
He's a really important leader,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
a real visionary, forward-thinking man,

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000
and he told me two things when I approached him.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000
He said, "Greg, there's two things I'd like you to do.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
One is, remember I'm a politician,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000
so you've got to go out and work with my ministers

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
and convince the people of Kiribati that this is a good idea.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Secondly, I'd like you to create principles

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
that will transcend my own presidency.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
I don't want to do something like this

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000
if it's going to go away after I'm voted out of office."

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
So we had very strong leadership, very good vision

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
and a lot of science, a lot of lawyers involved.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Many, many steps were taken to pull this off.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
And it was primarily because Kiribati realized

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
that this was in their own self-interest to do this.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000
They realized that this was a common cause

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
that they had found

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
with the conservation community.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Then in 2002,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000
when this was all going full-swing,

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000
a coral-bleaching event happened in the Phoenix Islands.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Here's this resource that we're looking to save,

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
and it turns out it's the hottest heating event

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
that we can find on record.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
The ocean heated up as it does sometimes,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
and the hot spot formed and stalled

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
right over the Phoenix Islands for six months.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
It was over 32 degrees Celsius for six months

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
and it basically killed

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
60 percent of the coral.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
So suddenly we had this area that we were protecting,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000
but now it appeared to be dead, at least in the coral areas.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Of course the deep-sea areas and the open ocean areas were fine,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
but the coral, which everybody likes to look at, was in trouble.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Well, the good news is it's recovered

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000
and recovering fast,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
faster than any reef we've seen.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
This picture was just taken by Brian Skerry a few months ago

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.000
when we returned to the Phoenix Islands

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
and discovered that, because it is a protected area

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
and has healthy fish populations

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000
that keep the algae grazed down

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
and keep the rest of the reef healthy,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
the coral is booming, is just booming back.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
It's almost like if a person

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
has multiple diseases,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:19.000
it's hard to get well, you might die,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
but if you only have one disease to deal with, you can get better.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
And that's the story with climate-change heating.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000
It's the only threat,

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
the only influence that the reef had to deal with.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
There was no fishing, there was no pollution, there was no coastal development,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000
and the reef is on a full-bore recovery.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Now I remember that dinner I had with the Minister of Fisheries 10 years ago

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
when we first brought this up and I got quite animated during the dinner

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
and said, "Well, I think that the conservation community

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
might embrace this idea, Minister."

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
He paused and put his hands together and said,

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
"Yes, Greg,

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
but the devil will be in the details," he said.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
And it certainly was.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000
The last 10 years have been detail after detail

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
ranging from creating legislation

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
to multiple research expeditions

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
to communication plans,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
as I said, teams of lawyers,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
MOUs,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
creating the Phoenix Islands Trust Board.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
And we are now in the process of raising the full endowment.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Kiribati has frozen extracting activities

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
at its current state while we raise the endowment.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
We just had our first PIPA Trust Board meeting three weeks ago.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
So it's a fully functional

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
up-and-running entity

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000
that negotiates the reverse fishing license with the country.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
And the PIPA Trust Board holds that license

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
and pays the country for this.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
So it's a very solid, very well thought-out,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
very well grounded system,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
and it was a bottom-up system,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000
and that was very important with this work,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
from the bottom up to secure this.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
So the conditions for success here are listed.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000
You can read them yourselves.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000
But I would say the most important one in my mind

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
was working within the market forces

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
of the situation.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
And that insured that we could move this forward

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
and it would have both the self-interest of Kiribati

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
as well as the self-interest of the world.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
And I'll leave you with one final slide,

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
that is: how do we scale this up?

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000
How do we realize Sylvia's dream?

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
Where eventually do we take this?

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Here's the Pacific

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
with large MPAs

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000
and large conservation zones on it.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
And as you can see,

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
we have a patchwork across this ocean.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
I've just described to you the one story

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000
behind that rectangular area in the middle, the Phoenix Islands,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000
but every other green patch on that

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
has its own story.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
And what we need to do now

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
is look at the whole Pacific Ocean

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
in its entirety

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
and make a network of MPAs

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.000
across the Pacific

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
so that we have our world's largest ocean

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
protected and self-sustaining

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
over time.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Thank you very much. (Applause)
