Clearing them is slow, expensive and dangerous. The founder of Apopo, Bart Weetjens, talks about his extraordinary project: training rats to sniff out land mines. He shows clips of his \"hero rats\" in action, and previews his work's next phase: teaching them to turn up tuberculosis in the lab.", "author": "Bart Weetjens", "keywords": "TED, talks, Africa, TEDx, animals, smell, technology, war", "talk_id": "1019", "lang": ["el", "eo", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "cs", "id", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "lt", "ro", "pl", "fr", "bg", "hr", "de", "hu", "fa", "bs", "fi", "ja", "he", "ko", "sk"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/BartWeetjens_2010X", "views": "611,179"}
