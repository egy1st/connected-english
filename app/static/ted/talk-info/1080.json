By pushing to improve surgical techniques, he helps to improve their lives; and by commissioning their portraits, he celebrates their humanity. NOTE: This talk contains images of disfigured and badly injured faces that may be disturbing -- and Hutchison provides thoughtful answers as to why a disfigured face can shock us so deeply. Squeamish? Hide your screen from 12:10 - 13:19, but do keep listening. Portraits shown in this talk come from Mark Gilbert.", "author": "Iain Hutchison", "keywords": "TED, talks, body language, community, culture, design, medical research, science and art, Surgery, science", "talk_id": "1080", "lang": ["en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "cs", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "ro", "pl", "fr", "bg", "hr", "de", "ja", "he", "ko", "sv", "uk"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/IainHutchison_2010G", "views": "660,849"}
