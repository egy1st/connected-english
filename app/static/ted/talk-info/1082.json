As Hillis explains it, genomics shows us a list of the ingredients of the body -- while proteomics shows us what those ingredients produce. Understanding what's going on in your body at the protein level may lead to a new understanding of how cancer happens.", "author": "Danny Hillis", "keywords": "TED, talks, cancer, genetics, medical research", "talk_id": "1082", "lang": ["el", "en", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "es", "ru", "nl", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "ro", "pl", "fr", "bg", "de", "hu", "ja", "he", "ka", "sr", "ko", "vi"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/DannyHillis_2010P", "views": "465,547"}
