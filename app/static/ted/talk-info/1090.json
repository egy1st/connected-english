He shows the power of interactive exercises, and calls for teachers to consider flipping the traditional classroom script -- give students video lectures to watch at home, and do \"homework\" in the classroom with the teacher available to help.", "author": "Sal Khan", "keywords": "TED, talks, culture, education, global issues, online video, teaching", "talk_id": "1090", "lang": ["el", "en", "af", "vi", "ca", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "uk", "cs", "id", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "lv", "zh-Hans", "lt", "th", "ro", "pl", "fr", "bg", "ms", "hr", "de", "da", "fa", "hi", "fi", "hu", "ja", "he", "ka", "sr", "sq", "ko", "sv", "ur", "sk", "ku", "uz"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/SalmanKhan_2011", "views": "5,581,813"}
