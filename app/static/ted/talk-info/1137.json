He pulls from passive data sets -- like the calls we make, the garbage we throw away -- to create surprising visualizations of city life. And he and his team create dazzling interactive environments from moving water and flying light, powered by simple gestures caught through sensors.", "author": "Carlo Ratti", "keywords": "TED, talks, cities, design, entertainment, technology", "talk_id": "1137", "lang": ["el", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "cs", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "ro", "pl", "fr", "bg", "hr", "de", "hu", "fa", "hy", "ja", "he", "sr", "sq", "ko", "uk"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/CarloRatti_2011", "views": "747,050"}
