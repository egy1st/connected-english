In a breakthrough experiment, Aaron O'Connell has blurred that distinction by creating an object that is visible to the unaided eye, but provably in two places at the same time. In this talk he suggests an intriguing way of thinking about the result.", "author": "Aaron O'Connell", "keywords": "TED, talks, philosophy, physics, science, quantum physics", "talk_id": "1160", "lang": ["en", "vi", "ca", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "cs", "id", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "lt", "ro", "pl", "fr", "bg", "hr", "de", "hu", "fa", "ja", "he", "ko", "uk", "sl", "el"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/AaronOConnell_2011", "views": "1,483,125"}
