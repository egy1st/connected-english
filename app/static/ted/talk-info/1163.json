He's found fossils with extraordinarily well-preserved blood vessels and soft tissues, but never intact DNA. So, in a new approach, he's taking living descendants of the dinosaur (chickens) and genetically engineering them to reactivate ancestral traits \u2014 including teeth, tails, and even hands \u2014 to make a \"Chickenosaurus\".", "author": "Jack Horner", "keywords": "TED, talks, dinosaurs, genetics, paleontology, science", "talk_id": "1163", "lang": ["zh-Hant", "el", "en", "vi", "it", "hy", "pt-BR", "cs", "gl", "id", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "tr", "zh-Hans", "th", "ro", "pl", "fr", "bg", "hr", "de", "da", "hu", "ja", "he", "ko", "sv", "sk", "ar"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/JackHorner_2011", "views": "3,390,422"}
