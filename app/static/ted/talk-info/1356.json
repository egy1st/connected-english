So she asked scientist Tyrone Hayes to brief her on one he studied closely: atrazine, a herbicide used on corn. (Hayes, an expert on amphibians, is a critic of atrazine, which displays a disturbing effect on frog development.) Onstage together at TEDWomen, Hayes and Chaffer tell their story.", "author": "Tyrone Hayes + Penelope Jagessar Chaffer", "keywords": "TED, talks, animals, biology, children, film, plastic, science, sex, pregnancy, public health, science and art, pollution, cancer, chemistry, environment, health, ecology, activism, agriculture, sustainability", "talk_id": "1356", "lang": ["el", "en", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "zh-Hans", "th", "ro", "pl", "fr", "bg", "hr", "de", "hu", "fa", "ja", "he", "ko", "vi"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/TyroneHayes_2010W", "views": "553,551"}
