These issues, which are wrapped up in America's unexamined history, are rarely talked about with this level of candor, insight and persuasiveness.", "author": "Bryan Stevenson", "keywords": "TED, talks, crime, culture, global issues, inequality, law, race, criminal justice, justice system", "talk_id": "1378", "lang": ["el", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "cs", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hans", "zh-Hant", "tr", "hr", "th", "ro", "pl", "fr", "bg", "de", "hu", "fa", "hy", "ja", "he", "sr", "sq", "ko", "sv", "ms", "mn", "id"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/BryanStevenson_2012", "views": "6,363,126"}
