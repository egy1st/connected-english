In this powerful talk, which focuses on a deadly shooting at sunset, he suggests that even close-up eyewitnesses to a crime can create \"memories\" they could not have seen. Why? Because the brain abhors a vacuum. Editor's note: In the original version of this talk, Scott Fraser misspoke about available footage of Two World Trade Center (Tower 2). The misstatement has been edited out for clarity.", "author": "Scott Fraser", "keywords": "TED, talks, TEDx, crime, global issues, government, law, memory, mind, prison, science, psychology, neuroscience, cognitive science, brain, sight, forensics", "talk_id": "1560", "lang": ["el", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "cs", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "ro", "pl", "fr", "de", "hu", "ja", "he", "sr", "sq", "ko", "sv", "mk", "ka"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/ScottFraser_2012X", "views": "1,284,570"}
