The image has inspired an annual father-daughter ritual, where Addis and his daughter pose for the same picture, on the same corner, each year. Addis shares 15 treasured photographs from the series, and explores why this small, repeated ritual means so much.", "author": "Steven Addis", "keywords": "TED, talks, children, parenting, photography", "talk_id": "1634", "lang": ["el", "af", "vi", "it", "ar", "bg", "ga", "cs", "et", "id", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "ne", "zh-Hans", "lt", "en", "th", "ro", "pl", "fr", "hy", "sl", "hr", "bo", "da", "fa", "fi", "hu", "ja", "he", "sr", "sq", "ko", "sv", "sk", "de", "uk", "mr", "pt-BR", "my", "mn", "ku"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/StevenAddis_2012", "views": "1,554,064"}
