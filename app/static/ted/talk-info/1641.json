So: Why haven't we found a way to effectively kill mosquitos yet? Hadyn Parry presents a fascinating solution: genetically engineering male mosquitos to make them sterile, and releasing the insects into the wild, to cut down on disease-carrying species.", "author": "Hadyn Parry", "keywords": "TED, talks, animals, biotech, disease, global issues, insects, pandemic, science, technology, engineering, biomimicry, synthetic biology, DNA, genetics, public health, ecology, health, illness, innovation", "talk_id": "1641", "lang": ["en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "cs", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "ro", "pl", "fr", "bg", "de", "da", "fa", "hu", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "uk", "id"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/HadynParry_2012S", "views": "1,020,524"}
