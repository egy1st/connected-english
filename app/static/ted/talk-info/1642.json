And yet, when faced with major, data-supported, end-of-the-world problems in real life, too often we retreat into partisan shouting and stalemate. Jonathan Haidt shows us a few of the very real asteroids headed our way -- some pet causes of the left wing, some of the right -- and suggests how both wings could work together productively to benefit humanity as a whole.", "author": "Jonathan Haidt", "keywords": "TED, talks, global issues, politics, society, psychology", "talk_id": "1642", "lang": ["el", "en", "vi", "it", "pt-BR", "es", "ru", "nl", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "th", "ro", "pl", "fr", "de", "hu", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "mk", "ar"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/JonathanHaidt_2012S", "views": "663,194"}
