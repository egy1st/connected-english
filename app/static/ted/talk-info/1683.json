Please read \"Criticisms &amp; Updates\" below for more details.) \"Desertification is a fancy word for land that is turning to desert,\" begins Allan Savory in this quietly powerful talk. And it's happening to about two-thirds of the world's grasslands, accelerating climate change and causing traditional grazing societies to descend into social chaos.
