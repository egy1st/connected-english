Now 19, he returns to the TED stage to present a new take on an old topic: fission. Wilson, who has won backing to create a company to realize his vision, explains why he's so excited about his innovative design for small modular fission reactors -- and why it could be the next big step in solving the global energy crisis.", "author": "Taylor Wilson", "keywords": "TED, talks, innovation, nuclear energy, physics, science, technology, youth, alternative energy, chemistry, invention, energy, engineering, sustainability, future, space, electricity", "talk_id": "1727", "lang": ["el", "en", "vi", "it", "cs", "ar", "pt-BR", "id", "es", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "zh-Hans", "th", "ro", "fr", "ru", "de", "da", "fa", "fi", "hu", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "hr"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/TaylorWilson_2013", "views": "2,486,098"}
