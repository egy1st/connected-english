His years-long projects beautifully capture the human side of a global story that all too often involves death, destruction or decay. Here, he tells a deeply personal story of the craft that nearly killed him, and shows breathtaking images from his latest work, Genesis, which documents the world's forgotten people and places.", "author": "Sebasti\u00e3o Salgado", "keywords": "TED, talks, Brazil, activism, environment, global issues, photography", "talk_id": "1729", "lang": ["el", "vi", "ca", "it", "cs", "ar", "pt-BR", "eu", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "lt", "en", "th", "ro", "fr", "de", "hu", "fa", "ja", "he", "sr", "sq", "ko", "pl", "uk"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/SebastiaoSalgado_2013", "views": "1,945,292"}
