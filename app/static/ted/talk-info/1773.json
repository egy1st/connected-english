But when she tried to tell people about it, she learned an even more shocking truth: People didn't want to know. In a talk that's part history lesson, part call-to-action, Margaret Heffernan demonstrates the danger of willful blindness, and praises ordinary people like Benefield who are willing to speak up.", "author": "Margaret Heffernan", "keywords": "TED, talks, TEDx, culture, global issues, women in business, corruption", "talk_id": "1773", "lang": ["el", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "th", "ro", "pl", "fr", "bg", "de", "hu", "fa", "fi", "ja", "he", "sr", "sq", "ko", "sv", "sk", "uk"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/MargaretHeffernan_2013X", "views": "1,774,877"}
