In an impassioned talk, she charts the rise of a new class of plutocrats (those who are extremely powerful because they are extremely wealthy), and suggests that globalization and new technology are actually fueling, rather than closing, the global income gap. Freeland lays out three problems with plutocracy \u2026 and one glimmer of hope.", "author": "Chrystia Freeland", "keywords": "TED, talks, business, economics, global issues, inequality, money", "talk_id": "1791", "lang": ["el", "vi", "ca", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "id", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "en", "th", "ro", "pl", "fr", "bg", "hr", "de", "hu", "ja", "he", "sr", "sq", "ko", "uk", "fa"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/ChrystiaFreeland_2013G", "views": "2,116,327"}
