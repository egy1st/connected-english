So he organized a group of volunteer EMTs -- many on foot -- ready to drop everything and dash to save lives in their neighborhood. Today, United Hatzlah uses a smartphone app and a fleet of \"ambucycles\" to help nearby patients until an ambulance arrives. With an average response time of 3 minutes, last year, they treated 207,000 people in Israel. And the idea is going global.", "author": "Eli Beer", "keywords": "TED, talks, health, health care, medicine, peace, TEDMED", "talk_id": "1799", "lang": ["el", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "cs", "id", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "nb", "tr", "zh-Hans", "en", "th", "ro", "pl", "fr", "bg", "uk", "de", "fa", "hu", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "ur", "ms"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/EliBeer_2013P", "views": "1,117,129"}
