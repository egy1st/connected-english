That was until the voices in her head started talking. Initially innocuous, these internal narrators became increasingly antagonistic and dictatorial, turning her life into a living nightmare. Diagnosed with schizophrenia, hospitalized, drugged, Longden was discarded by a system that didn't know how to help her. Longden tells the moving tale of her years-long journey back to mental health, and makes the case that it was through learning to listen to her voices that she was able to survive.", "author": "Eleanor Longden", "keywords": "TED, talks, health, health care, mental health", "talk_id": "1800", "lang": ["eu", "el", "vi", "it", "cs", "ar", "pt-BR", "az", "id", "es", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hans", "zh-Hant", "tr", "hr", "lt", "en", "th", "ro", "pl", "fr", "bg", "ru", "de", "da", "fa", "bs", "fi", "hy", "hu", "ja", "he", "sr", "sq", "ko", "sv"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/EleanorLongden_2013", "views": "4,918,119"}
