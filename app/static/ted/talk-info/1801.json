Filmed right as controversy over her Broadway production of Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark was at its peak, she candidly describes the tensions inherent within her creative process, as she strives both to capture the essence of a story--and produce images and experiences unlike anything else.", "author": "Julie Taymor", "keywords": "TED, talks, creativity, entertainment, fear, film, theater", "talk_id": "1801", "lang": ["el", "en", "vi", "ca", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "cs", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "zh-Hans", "th", "ro", "pl", "fr", "de", "hu", "fa", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "uk", "tr"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/JulieTaymor_2011", "views": "1,034,471"}
