And he asks: What do we know about sleep? Not a lot, it turns out, for something we do with one-third of our lives. In this talk, Foster shares three popular theories about why we sleep, busts some myths about how much sleep we need at different ages -- and hints at some bold new uses of sleep as a predictor of mental health.", "author": "Russell Foster", "keywords": "TED, talks, health, mental health, neuroscience, science, consciousness, biology, brain, mind, memory, cognitive science", "talk_id": "1810", "lang": ["el", "zh", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "cs", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hans", "zh-Hant", "tr", "lv", "hr", "en", "th", "ro", "pl", "fr", "bg", "de", "hu", "bs", "fi", "ja", "he", "uz", "sr", "sq", "mn", "ko", "sv", "mk", "sk", "uk", "ku"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/RussellFoster_2013G", "views": "8,023,959"}
