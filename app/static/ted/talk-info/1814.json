Not for her a life of sketching and stretching canvases. Instead, she selects a topic and then paints it--literally. She covers everything in a scene--people, chairs, food, you name it--in a mask of paint that mimics what's below it. In this eye-opening talk Meade shows off photographs of some of the more outlandish results, and shares a new project involving people, paint and milk.", "author": "Alexa Meade", "keywords": "TED, talks, creativity, design, art, painting, photography", "talk_id": "1814", "lang": ["el", "en", "zh", "vi", "ca", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "cs", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hans", "zh-Hant", "tr", "hr", "lt", "th", "ro", "pl", "fr", "bg", "de", "hu", "fa", "ja", "he", "sr", "sq", "ko", "sr", "uk", "my", "id"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/AlexaMeade_2013G", "views": "2,817,315"}
