But when, in 1995, the wolves began to come back (thanks to an aggressive management program), something interesting happened: the rest of the park began to find a new, more healthful balance. In a bold thought experiment, George Monbiot imagines a wilder world in which humans work to restore the complex, lost natural food chains that once surrounded us.", "author": "George Monbiot", "keywords": "TED, talks, animals, biodiversity, deextinction, science, ecology, environment, activism, oceans, community, climate change, sustainability, conservation", "talk_id": "1816", "lang": ["el", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "cs", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "ro", "pl", "fr", "bg", "de", "da", "hu", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "uk"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/GeorgeMonbiot_2013G", "views": "1,094,316"}
