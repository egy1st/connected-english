(Do you remember where you were?) So exhibits at the soon-to-open 9/11 Memorial Museum will reflect the diversity of the world's experiences of that day. In a moving talk, designer Jake Barton gives a peek at some of those installations, as well as several other projects that aim to make the observer an active participant in the exhibit.", "author": "Jake Barton", "keywords": "TED, talks, collaboration, design, museums", "talk_id": "1817", "lang": ["el", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "id", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "th", "ro", "pl", "fr", "de", "hu", "fa", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/JakeBarton_2013S", "views": "815,471"}
