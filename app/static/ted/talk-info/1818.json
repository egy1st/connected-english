In this charming, moving talk, he shows how he reads -- and celebrates the progression of clever tools and adaptive computer technologies that make it possible. With their help, and the help of volunteers, he's become a lawyer, an academic, and, most of all, a voracious reader. Welcome to the blind reading revolution.", "author": "Ron McCallum", "keywords": "TED, talks, TEDx, choice, design, disability, sight, technology, books, blindness", "talk_id": "1818", "lang": ["el", "en", "zh", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "cs", "id", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "ro", "pl", "fr", "bg", "uk", "fr-CA", "de", "fa", "fi", "hu", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "ms"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/RonMcCallum_2013X", "views": "719,502"}
