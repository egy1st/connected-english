In this charming talk, he shows off some recent psychedelic images, including photographs of crystals as they interact with soundwaves. And, in a live demo, he shows what really happens when you mix paint with magnetic liquid--or when you set fire to whiskey.", "author": "Fabian Oefner", "keywords": "TED, talks, photography, science, science and art, microbiology, nanoscale, physics, creativity, sound, demo, film, beauty, art", "talk_id": "1834", "lang": ["el", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "cs", "id", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "en", "th", "ro", "pl", "fr", "bg", "de", "fa", "hu", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "sv", "uk", "my", "ka"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/FabianOefner_2013G", "views": "1,897,070"}
