Typical bone regeneration -- wherein bone is taken from a patient\u2019s hip and grafted onto damaged bone elsewhere in the body -- is limited and can cause great pain just a few years after operation. In an informative talk, Molly Stevens introduces a new stem cell application that harnesses bone\u2019s innate ability to regenerate and produces vast quantities of bone tissue painlessly.", "author": "Molly Stevens", "keywords": "TED, talks, biotech, medicine, science, technology, synthetic biology, molecular biology, medical research, biomechanics, materials, design, biology, engineering, future, health, health care", "talk_id": "1845", "lang": ["el", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "en", "th", "ro", "fr", "hu", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "uk"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/MollyStevens_2013G", "views": "1,271,819"}
