But about eight years ago, people started moving in. Photographer Iwan Baan shows how people build homes in unlikely places, touring us through the family apartments of Torre David, a city on the water in Nigeria, and an underground village in China. Glorious images celebrate humanity's ability to survive and make a home -- anywhere.", "author": "Iwan Baan", "keywords": "TED, talks, cities, creativity, culture, design, photography", "talk_id": "1846", "lang": ["et", "en", "vi", "ca", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "id", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "zh-Hans", "th", "ro", "pl", "fr", "bg", "de", "hu", "fa", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "sk", "uk"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/IwanBaan_2013Z", "views": "1,589,649"}
