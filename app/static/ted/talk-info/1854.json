Other centers represented everything he hated about contemporary architecture: wasteful, glass towers requiring tons of energy whose design had absolutely nothing to do with Africa. In this charming talk, Vilalta shows how he champions an alternative approach: to harness nature, reference design tradition and create beautiful, modern, iconic buildings fit for a community.", "author": "Xavier Vilalta", "keywords": "TED, talks, Africa, TED Fellows, architecture, design", "talk_id": "1854", "lang": ["el", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "id", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hans", "zh-Hant", "tr", "ro", "pl", "fr", "bg", "de", "hu", "fa", "ja", "he", "sq", "ko", "uk", "sr", "hr"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/XavierVilalta_2013G", "views": "1,049,167"}
