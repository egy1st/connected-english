Fresh from his lab, Gr\u00e9goire Courtine shows a new method -- combining drugs, electrical stimulation and a robot -- that could re-awaken the neural pathways and help the body learn again to move on its own. See how it works, as a paralyzed rat becomes able to run and navigate stairs.", "author": "Gr\u00e9goire Courtine", "keywords": "TED, talks, biotech, health care, neuroscience, science, technology, animals, disability, biology, medicine, medical research, brain, innovation", "talk_id": "1860", "lang": ["el", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "cs", "es", "ru", "sr", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "th", "ro", "pl", "fr", "bg", "de", "fa", "fi", "hu", "ja", "he", "ko"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/GregoireCourtine_2013G", "views": "990,214"}
