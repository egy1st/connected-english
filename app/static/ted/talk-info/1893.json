In this thoughtful talk, economist Marco Annunziata looks at how technology is transforming the industrial sector, creating machines that can see, feel, sense and react -- so they can be operated far more efficiently. Think: airplane parts that send an alert when they need to be serviced, or wind turbines that communicate with one another to generate more electricity. It's a future with exciting implications for us all.", "author": "Marco Annunziata", "keywords": "TED, talks, economics, technology, infrastructure", "talk_id": "1893", "lang": ["el", "en", "vi", "ca", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "th", "pl", "fr", "bg", "de", "hu", "fa", "ja", "he", "ro", "sr", "sq", "ko", "sk", "uk"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/MarcoAnnunziata_2013S", "views": "1,510,261"}
