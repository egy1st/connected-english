Biomedical engineer Mark Kendall demos the Nanopatch, a one-centimeter-by-one-centimeter square vaccine that can be applied painlessly to the skin. He shows how this tiny piece of silicon can overcome four major shortcomings of the modern needle and syringe, at a fraction of the cost.", "author": "Mark Kendall", "keywords": "TED, talks, Vaccines, biology, health, medicine, science, technology, public health, health care, disease, bioethics, medical research, innovation, nanoscale, demo, microbiology, pharmaceuticals, product design, biotech, illness, future", "talk_id": "1905", "lang": ["el", "vi", "ca", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "cs", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hans", "zh-Hant", "tr", "hr", "en", "th", "ro", "pl", "ta", "fr", "hu", "fa", "ja", "he", "ko", "sv"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/MarkKendall_2013G", "views": "1,080,633"}
