Millions of views (and a best-selling book) later, the Facebook COO talks with the woman who pushed her to give that first talk, Pat Mitchell. Sandberg opens up about the reaction to her idea, and explores the ways that women still struggle with success.", "author": "Sheryl Sandberg", "keywords": "TED, talks, feminism, leadership, women, women in business, work, gender equality", "talk_id": "1906", "lang": ["el", "vi", "it", "ar", "id", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "en", "th", "ro", "be", "fr", "bg", "uk", "de", "hu", "fa", "ja", "he", "sq", "ko", "pl", "sl", "pt-BR"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/SherylSandberg_2013W", "views": "2,711,760"}
