Great big numbers and great big hopes were followed by some disappointing first results. But the head of edX, Anant Agarwal, makes the case that MOOCs still matter -- as a way to share high-level learning widely and supplement (but perhaps not replace) traditional classrooms. Agarwal shares his vision of blended learning, where teachers create the ideal learning experience for 21st century students.", "author": "Anant Agarwal", "keywords": "TED, talks, Internet, education, technology, teaching", "talk_id": "1913", "lang": ["el", "vi", "ca", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "cs", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "en", "ro", "pl", "fr", "bg", "de", "hu", "fa", "ja", "he", "sr", "sq", "ko", "uk", "hr"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/AnantAgarwal_2013G", "views": "1,396,008"}
