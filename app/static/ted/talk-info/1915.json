So at age 13, Pope started an online petition for the American toy company Hasbro to change the pink-and-purple color scheme on the classic toy and incorporate boys into its TV marketing. In a heartening talk, Pope makes the case for gender-neutral toys and gives a rousing call to action to all kids who feel powerless.", "author": "McKenna Pope", "keywords": "TED, talks, TEDYouth, activism, toy, youth", "talk_id": "1915", "lang": ["el", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "cs", "gl", "id", "es", "ru", "az", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hans", "zh-Hant", "tr", "th", "ro", "fr", "bg", "uk", "hr", "bn", "de", "hu", "fa", "ja", "he", "sr", "sq", "ko", "ur", "sk", "pl", "ms", "sl", "my"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/McKennaPope_2013Y", "views": "1,023,459"}
