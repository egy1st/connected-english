Nicolas Perony studies how individual animals -- be they Scottish Terriers, bats or meerkats -- follow simple rules that, collectively, create larger patterns of behavior. And how this complexity born of simplicity can help them adapt to new circumstances, as they arise.", "author": "Nicolas Perony", "keywords": "TED, talks, TEDx, animals, complexity", "talk_id": "1916", "lang": ["el", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "cs", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "lt", "en", "ro", "pl", "fr", "hu", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "uk"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/NicolasPerony_2013X", "views": "1,021,892"}
