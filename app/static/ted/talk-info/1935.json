But the repair doesn't happen quickly enough to allow recovery from degenerative conditions like motor neuron disease (also known as Lou Gehrig's disease or ALS). Siddharthan Chandran walks through some new techniques using special stem cells that could allow the damaged brain to rebuild faster.", "author": "Siddharthan Chandran", "keywords": "TED, talks, brain, health, neuroscience, science, synthetic biology, cognitive science, molecular biology, biotech, aging, health care, medicine, medical research, disability, future, innovation", "talk_id": "1935", "lang": ["el", "vi", "ca", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "cs", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hans", "zh-Hant", "tr", "hr", "en", "th", "ro", "pl", "fr", "bg", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "uk"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/SiddharthanChandran_2013G", "views": "1,389,825"}
