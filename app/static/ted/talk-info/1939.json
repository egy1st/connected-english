And as a brain surgery patient herself, she is driven to know more about the neural activity that underlies invention, creativity, thought. She meshes these two passions in a rather mind-blowing talk on two cutting-edge brain studies that might point to a new frontier in understanding how (and what) we think.", "author": "Mary Lou Jepsen", "keywords": "TED, talks, brain, creativity, neuroscience, science, engineering, biotech, intelligence, Surgery, cognitive science, computers, interface design, medical imaging, technology, memory, visualizations, medical research", "talk_id": "1939", "lang": ["el", "zh", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "cs", "es", "ru", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "lt", "en", "ro", "fr", "bg", "hr", "de", "hu", "fa", "ja", "he", "sr", "sq", "ko", "sk", "pl", "uk"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/MaryJepsen_2013", "views": "1,036,110"}
