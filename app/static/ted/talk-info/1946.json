And he asks a big question: Instead of warehousing these criminals, shouldn't we be using what we know about the brain to help them rehabilitate? Put another way: If the brain can grow new neural pathways after an injury ... could we help the brain re-grow morality?", "author": "Dan Reisel", "keywords": "TED, talks, brain, crime, culture, global issues, science, psychology, cognitive science, behavioral economics, empathy, morality, prison, neuroscience", "talk_id": "1946", "lang": ["el", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "cs", "gl", "es", "ru", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "th", "ro", "pl", "fr", "bg", "hr", "de", "hu", "fa", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/DanielReisel_2013", "views": "886,266"}
