Herr lost both legs in a climbing accident 30 years ago; now, as the head of the MIT Media Lab's Biomechatronics group, he shows his incredible technology in a talk that's both technical and deeply personal \u2014 with the help of ballroom dancer Adrianne Haslet-Davis, who lost her left leg in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, and performs again for the first time on the TED stage.", "author": "Hugh Herr", "keywords": "TED, talks, dance, prosthetics, technology, bionics", "talk_id": "1959", "lang": ["el", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hans", "zh-Hant", "tr", "lv", "hr", "en", "th", "ro", "pl", "fr", "bg", "fa", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "sv", "sk"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/HughHerr_2014", "views": "13,313,364"}
