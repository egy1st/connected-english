Only we haven't seen any of them -- yet. Jeremy Kasdin and his team are looking to change that with the design and engineering of an extraordinary piece of equipment: a flower petal-shaped \"starshade\" positioned 50,000 km from a telescope to enable imaging of planets about distant stars. It is, he says, the \"coolest possible science.\"", "author": "Jeremy Kasdin", "keywords": "TED, talks, Planets, astronomy, space, technology, science, telescopes", "talk_id": "1976", "lang": ["el", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "th", "ro", "pl", "fr", "hr", "de", "da", "fa", "hu", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "sk", "uk", "lt"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/JeremyKasdin_2014", "views": "1,421,463"}
