But, with the help of improv theater, he came to realize that there could be joy in getting lost. A call for scientists to stop thinking of research as a direct line from question to answer, but as something more creative. It's a message that will resonate, no matter what your field.", "author": "Uri Alon", "keywords": "TED, talks, creativity, science, theater, science and art, teaching, social change, medical research", "talk_id": "2020", "lang": ["el", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "es", "ru", "pt", "zh-Hant", "zh-Hans", "th", "ro", "fr", "bg", "da", "fa", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "pl", "hu", "uk"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/UriAlon_2013G", "views": "1,124,598"}
