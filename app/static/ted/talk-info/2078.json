The two are developing the Lowline, an underground greenspace the size of a football field. They're building it in a trolley terminal abandoned in 1948, using technology that harvests sunlight above-ground and directs it down below. It's a park that can thrive, even in winter.", "author": "Dan Barasch", "keywords": "TED, talks, New York, architecture, cities", "talk_id": "2078", "lang": ["el", "en", "vi", "ca", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "id", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "lt", "ro", "pl", "fr", "bg", "de", "hu", "fa", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "uk", "my", "hr"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/DanBarasch_2014S", "views": "934,640"}
