When this talk was given, 50 million people had been forcefully displaced from their homes by conflict and war; now the number is 65.3 million. There were 3 million Syrian refugees in 2014; now there are 4.9 million. Inside this overwhelming crisis are the individual human stories -- of care, growth and family, in the face of lost education, lost home, lost future. Melissa Fleming of the UN's refugee agency tells the refugees' stories -- and asks us to help them rebuild their world.", "author": "Melissa Fleming", "keywords": "TED, talks, education, global issues, poverty, war, Syria, refugees", "talk_id": "2110", "lang": ["pt-BR", "el", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "et", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "zh-Hans", "th", "ro", "pl", "fr", "bg", "hu", "fa", "hi", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "sk", "uk", "id", "tr"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/MelissaFleming_2014G", "views": "1,342,967"}
