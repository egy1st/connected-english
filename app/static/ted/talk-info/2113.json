What he learned from a childhood across Africa was that while good leaders can't make much of a difference in societies with strong institutions, in countries with weak structures, leaders could make or break a country. In a passionate talk the entrepreneur and TED Fellow looks at different generations of African leaders and imagines how to develop the leadership of the future.", "author": "Fred Swaniker", "keywords": "TED, talks, Africa, TED Fellows, entrepreneur", "talk_id": "2113", "lang": ["hr", "el", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "lt", "ro", "fr", "de", "fa", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "uk", "pl"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/FredSwaniker_2014G", "views": "1,361,999"}
