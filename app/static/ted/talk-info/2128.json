Rather than building a large building with small units, he built flexible half-homes that each family could expand on. It was a complex problem, but with a simple solution \u2014 one that he arrived at by working with the families themselves. With a chalkboard and beautiful images of his designs, Aravena walks us through three projects where clever rethinking led to beautiful design with great benefit.", "author": "Alejandro Aravena", "keywords": "TED, talks, architecture, cities, design, infrastructure", "talk_id": "2128", "lang": ["el", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "th", "ro", "pl", "fr", "hr", "de", "fa", "ja", "he", "sr", "sq", "ko", "mk", "uk", "cs"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/AlejandroAravena_2014G", "views": "2,005,880"}
