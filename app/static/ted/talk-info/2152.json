When Khalida Brohi lost a close friend to the practice, she resolved to campaign against it. Yet she met resistance from an unlikely source: the very community she hoped to protect. In this powerful, honest talk, Brohi shares how she took a hard look at her own process, and offers sharp insights for other passionate activists.", "author": "Khalida Brohi", "keywords": "TED, talks, Middle East, activism, feminism, violence, women", "talk_id": "2152", "lang": ["el", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "cs", "id", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "pl", "fr", "hr", "da", "fa", "hu", "ja", "he", "sr", "mn", "ko", "sv", "uk"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/KhalidaBrohi_2014G", "views": "1,214,786"}
