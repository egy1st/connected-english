Spurred by the jaw-dropping losses of the 1990s, new laws (and transparent data) are helping slow the rate of deforestation in Brazil. Is it enough? Not yet. He has five ideas about what we should do next. And he asks if the lessons learned in Brazil could be applied to an even bigger problem: global climate change.", "author": "Tasso Azevedo", "keywords": "TED, talks, climate change, politics, science, ecology, trees, conservation, plants, environment, social change, sustainability, green, global commons", "talk_id": "2166", "lang": ["el", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "ro", "fr", "hu", "fa", "ja", "he", "mn", "ko", "sv", "sk", "uk", "de", "pl"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/TassoAzevedo_2014G", "views": "947,377"}
