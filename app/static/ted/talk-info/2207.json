Now as a prison reform advocate he works to change the culture of American jails and prisons, where young people are frequently subjected to violence beyond imagination. Nazario tells his chilling story and suggests ways to help, rather than harm, teens in jail.", "author": "Ismael Nazario", "keywords": "TED, talks, TEDx, activism, cities, crime, prison, social change, violence, youth", "talk_id": "2207", "lang": ["el", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "lt", "ro", "fr", "hr", "hu", "fa", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "uk", "sl", "pl"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/IsmaelNazario_2014X", "views": "1,503,406"}
