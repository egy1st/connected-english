For the first time, he recounts the experience \u2014 from what it was like to live in a dark, underground chamber, chained to his bed, to the unexpected conversations he had with his captors. With lyricism and power, he explains why he continues his work today. Since 2000, attacks on humanitarian aid workers have tripled \u2014 and he wonders what that rise may signal to the world.", "author": "Vincent Cochetel", "keywords": "TED, talks, TEDx, global issues, peace, war", "talk_id": "2211", "lang": ["el", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "id", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "th", "pl", "fr", "hu", "fa", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "uk", "sl", "ro"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/VincentCochetel_2014X", "views": "1,200,460"}
