But for Batoor, a member of a displaced ethnic group called the Hazara, moving home to Pakistan proved dangerous too. And finding a safer place wasn't as simple as buying a plane ticket. Instead, he was forced to pay a human smuggler, and join the deadly tidal wave of migrants seeking asylum by boat. He documents the harrowing ocean trip with powerful photographs.", "author": "Barat Ali Batoor", "keywords": "TED, talks, global issues, immigration, photography", "talk_id": "2231", "lang": ["el", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "id", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "lt", "th", "ro", "pl", "fr", "hr", "de", "hu", "fa", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "sv"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/BaratAliBatoor_2014X", "views": "1,042,008"}
