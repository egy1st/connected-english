Planetary scientist Nathalie Cabrol takes us inside the search for microbes on Mars, a hunt which counterintuitively leads us to the remote lakes of the Andes mountains. This extreme environment \u2014 with its thin atmosphere and scorched land \u2014 approximates the surface of Mars about 3.5 billion years ago. How microbes adapt to survive here may just show us where to look on Mars \u2014 and could help us understand why some microbial pathways lead to civilization while others are a dead end.", "author": "Nathalie Cabrol", "keywords": "TED, talks, Planets, exploration, microbiology, space, solar system, Mars, astrobiology", "talk_id": "2235", "lang": ["el", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "cs", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hans", "zh-Hant", "tr", "ro", "fr", "bg", "fr-CA", "hu", "fa", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "sk", "uk", "th", "pl"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/NathalieCabrol_2015", "views": "1,262,849"}
