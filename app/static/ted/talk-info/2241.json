In an eye-opening talk, she describes her decade-long quest to isolate a gene that allows rice to survive prolonged flooding. She shows how the genetic improvement of seeds saved the Hawaiian papaya crop in the 1990s \u2014 and makes the case that modern genetics is sometimes the most effective method to advance sustainable agriculture and enhance food security for our planet\u2019s growing population.", "author": "Pamela Ronald", "keywords": "TED, talks, agriculture, food, global issues, sustainability", "talk_id": "2241", "lang": ["en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hans", "zh-Hant", "tr", "hr", "th", "fr", "bg", "de", "fa", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "sv", "sk", "cs", "pl"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/PamelaRonald_2015", "views": "1,823,602"}
