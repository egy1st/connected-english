His insight exploits something we're just beginning to understand about bacteria: their power of quorum sensing, or doing something together once they reach critical mass. Danino, a TED Fellow, explains how quorum sensing works -- and how clever bacteria working together could someday change cancer treatment.", "author": "Tal Danino", "keywords": "TED, talks, TED Fellows, bacteria, biology, cancer, health", "talk_id": "2245", "lang": ["pt-BR", "en", "el", "vi", "it", "sv", "ar", "cs", "gl", "id", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hans", "zh-Hant", "tr", "hr", "lt", "th", "ro", "fr", "bg", "uk", "de", "fa", "hi", "ja", "he", "sr", "sq", "ko", "sk", "my", "hu", "pl"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/TalDanino_2015U", "views": "1,330,157"}
