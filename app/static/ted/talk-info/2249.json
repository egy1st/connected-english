But what is making bee colonies so vulnerable? Photographer Anand Varma raised bees in his backyard \u2014 in front of a camera \u2014 to get an up close view. This project, for National Geographic, gives a lyrical glimpse into a beehive, and reveals one of the biggest threats to its health, a mite that preys on baby bees in their first 21 days of life. With footage set to music from Rob Moose and the Magik*Magik Orchestra, Varma shows the problem ... and what's being done to solve it.
