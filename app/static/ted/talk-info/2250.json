They share a moving song about their experiences \u2014 one that reveals their hopes, regrets and fears. \"I'm not an angel,\" sings one, \"but I'm not the devil.\"\u00a0Filmed at an independent TEDx event inside Muncy State Prison,\u00a0it's a rare and poignant look inside the world of people imprisoned with no hope of parole. (Note: The prison's Office of Victim Advocacy has ensured that victims were treated fairly and respectfully around this TEDx event.)", "author": "The Lady Lifers", "keywords": "TED, talks, music, prison, live music, entertainment", "talk_id": "2250", "lang": ["el", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "id", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "lt", "ro", "pl", "fr", "fr-CA", "da", "fa", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "ur", "uk", "my", "th", "et"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/TheLadyLifers_2014X", "views": "1,407,066"}
