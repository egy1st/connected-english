Yet they're absent from our digital lives; the devices and apps we interact with have no way of knowing how we feel. Scientist\u00a0Rana el Kaliouby\u00a0aims to change that. She demos a powerful new technology that reads your facial expressions and matches them to corresponding emotions.\u00a0This\u00a0\"emotion engine\"\u00a0has big implications, she says, and could change not just how we interact with machines -- but with each other.", "author": "Rana el Kaliouby", "keywords": "TED, talks, compassion, computers, psychology, technology, emotions", "talk_id": "2279", "lang": ["el", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "th", "ro", "fr", "hr", "fa", "ja", "he", "sr", "sq", "ko", "sv", "uk", "my", "hu", "ku"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/RanaelKaliouby_2015W", "views": "1,614,986"}
