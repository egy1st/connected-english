In this hilarious, fast-paced talk, he explains the two techniques designers use to communicate instantly -- clarity and mystery -- and when, why and how they work. He celebrates beautiful, useful pieces of design, skewers less successful work, and shares the thinking behind some of his own iconic book covers.", "author": "Chip Kidd", "keywords": "TED, talks, TED Books, books, creativity, design, literature", "talk_id": "2287", "lang": ["el", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "lt", "ro", "pl", "fr", "bg", "hr", "de", "hi", "fi", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "uk", "mr", "hu", "zh"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/ChipKidd_2015S", "views": "2,001,925"}
