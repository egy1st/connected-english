In America, for example, one in three women will have an abortion in their lifetime, yet the strong emotions sparked by the topic -- and the highly politicized rhetoric around it -- leave little room for thoughtful, open debate. In this personal, thoughtful talk, Aspen Baker makes the case for being neither \u201cpro-life\u201d nor \u201cpro-choice\u201d but rather \"pro-voice\" -- and for the roles that listening and storytelling can play when it comes to discussing difficult topics.", "author": "Aspen Baker", "keywords": "TED, talks, culture, decision-making, morality, society, storytelling, women", "talk_id": "2297", "lang": ["el", "en", "vi", "ca", "it", "sv", "ar", "pt-BR", "cs", "id", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "lt", "ro", "fr", "bg", "hr", "fa", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "pl", "uk", "mr", "de"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/AspenBaker_2015W", "views": "1,792,529"}
