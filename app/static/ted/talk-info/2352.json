These units were opened secretly, and radically alter how prisoners are treated -- even preventing them from hugging their children. Potter, a TED Fellow, shows us who is imprisoned here, and how the government is trying to keep them hidden. \"The message was clear,\" he says. \"Don't talk about this place.\" Find sources for this talk at  willpotter.com/cmu", "author": "Will Potter", "keywords": "TED, talks, TED Fellows, communication, crime, journalism, prison, privacy, criminal justice, justice system", "talk_id": "2352", "lang": ["el", "en", "vi", "ca", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "cs", "id", "es", "ru", "pt", "zh-Hans", "zh-Hant", "tr", "hr", "ro", "pl", "fr", "hu", "fa", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "uk", "nl"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/WillPotter_2015F", "views": "4,514,026"}
