As Hilary Cottam shows, in the UK a typical family in crisis can be eligible for services from more than 70 different agencies, but it's unlikely that any one of them can really make a difference. Cottam, a social entrepreneur herself, asks us to think about the ways we solve deep and complex social problems. How can we build supportive, enthusiastic relationships between those in need and those that provide help?", "author": "Hilary Cottam", "keywords": "TED, talks, big problems, community, social change", "talk_id": "2364", "lang": ["en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "es", "ru", "nl", "zh-Hant", "tr", "ne", "zh-Hans", "fr", "hu", "fa", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "uk", "pl", "pt"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/HilaryCottam_2015G", "views": "782,287"}
