So why is America one of the only countries in the world that offers no national paid leave to new working mothers? In this incisive talk, Jessica Shortall makes the impassioned case that the reality of new working motherhood in America is both hidden and horrible: millions of women, every year, are forced back to work within just weeks of giving birth. Her idea worth spreading: the time has come for us to recognize the economic, physical and psychological costs of our approach to working mothers and their babies, and to secure our economic future by providing paid leave to all working parents.", "author": "Jessica Shortall", "keywords": "TED, talks, activism, big problems, economics, future, humanity, family, health, health care, government, parenting, society, social change, work, TEDx, women in business, women", "talk_id": "2384", "lang": ["pt-BR", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "id", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "pl", "fr", "de", "da", "fa", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "sk", "uk", "my", "gl", "th"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/JessicaShortall_2015X", "views": "1,522,200"}
