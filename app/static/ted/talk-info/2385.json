As she admits, it's easy to get sad about the state of coral reefs; they're in the news lately because of how quickly they're bleaching, dying and turning to slime. But the good news is that we're learning more and more about these amazing marine invertebrates -- including how to help them (and help them help us). This biologist and TED Senior Fellow offers a glimpse into the wonderful and mysterious lives of these hard-working and fragile creatures.", "author": "Kristen Marhaver", "keywords": "TED, talks, animals, biology, environment, climate change, microbiology, mission blue, nature, oceans, science, pollution, water, TED Fellows, marine biology, coral reefs", "talk_id": "2385", "lang": ["en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "cs", "id", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "th", "pl", "fr", "hr", "de", "hu", "fa", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "sv", "uk", "sk"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/KristenMarhaver_2015Z", "views": "900,128"}
