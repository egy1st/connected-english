Using fluid dynamics, he created computational simulations of how air moves on airplanes, and what he found is disturbing -- when a person sneezes on a plane, the airflow actually helps to spread pathogens to other passengers. Wang shares an unforgettable animation of how a sneeze travels inside a plane cabin as well as his prize-winning solution: a small, fin-shaped device that increases fresh airflow in airplanes and redirects pathogen-laden air out of circulation.", "author": "Raymond Wang", "keywords": "TED, talks, TEDYouth, aircraft, bacteria, design, illness, engineering, flight, health, innovation, invention, physics, science, transportation", "talk_id": "2391", "lang": ["el", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "cs", "id", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hans", "zh-Hant", "nb", "tr", "hr", "th", "ro", "pl", "fr", "hu", "fa", "da", "ja", "he", "te", "sr", "ko", "sv", "mk", "sk", "sl", "my", "de"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/RaymondWang_2015Y", "views": "1,828,216"}
