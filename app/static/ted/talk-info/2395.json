Taylor creates sculptures of human forms and mundane life on land and sinks them to the ocean floor, where they are subsumed by the sea and transformed from lifeless stone into vibrant habitats for corals, crustaceans and other creatures. The result: Enigmatic, haunting and colorful commentaries about our transient existence, the sacredness of the ocean and its breathtaking power of regeneration.", "author": "Jason deCaires Taylor", "keywords": "TED, talks, mission blue, art, fish, life, nature, oceans, water, entertainment, design, creativity, ecology, science and art, coral reefs", "talk_id": "2395", "lang": ["en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "cs", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hans", "zh-Hant", "tr", "lv", "hr", "th", "ro", "pl", "fr", "de", "da", "fa", "hu", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "mk", "uk", "my"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/JasondeCairesTaylor_2015Z", "views": "1,651,816"}
