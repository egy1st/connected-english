In conversation with TED's Bruno Giussani, Guterres discusses the historical causes of the current crisis and outlines the mood of the European countries that are trying to screen, shelter and resettle hundreds of thousands of desperate families. Bigger picture: Guterres calls for a multilateral turn toward acceptance and respect -- to defy groups like ISIS's anti-refugee propaganda and recruiting machine.", "author": "Ant\u00f3nio Guterres", "keywords": "TED, talks, Europe, future, government, global issues, immigration, humanity, interview, policy, society, social change, terrorism", "talk_id": "2397", "lang": ["eo", "en", "el", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "cs", "id", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hans", "zh-Hant", "nb", "tr", "hr", "fr", "bg", "de", "hu", "fa", "he", "sr", "ko", "mk", "th", "sv", "ja", "gl"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/AntonioGuterres_2015G", "views": "1,188,864"}
