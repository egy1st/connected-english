In this talk, civil and environmental engineer David Sedlak shares four practical solutions to the ongoing urban water crisis. His goal: to shift our water supply towards new, local sources of water and create a system that is capable of withstanding any of the challenges climate change may throw at us in the coming years.", "author": "David Sedlak", "keywords": "TED, talks, TEDx, chemistry, climate change, design, engineering, environment, future, global issues, industrial design, innovation, public health, sustainability, urban planning, water, population, infrastructure", "talk_id": "2404", "lang": ["en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "id", "es", "ru", "pt", "zh-Hant", "zh-Hans", "th", "de", "fa", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "uk", "fr", "cs"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/DavidSedlak_2015X", "views": "1,150,140"}
