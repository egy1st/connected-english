Would you think that the computer had expressed itself and been creative, or would you feel like you had fallen for a cheap trick? In this talk, writer Oscar Schwartz examines why we react so strongly to the idea of a computer writing poetry -- and how this reaction helps us understand what it means to be human.", "author": "Oscar Schwartz", "keywords": "TED, talks, TEDx, algorithm, composing, creativity, computers, identity, language, literature, technology, poetry, TEDYouth, writing, AI", "talk_id": "2411", "lang": ["el", "en", "it", "pt-BR", "cs", "gl", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "lt", "th", "fr", "bg", "de", "fa", "hu", "ja", "he", "sq", "ko", "sv", "sr", "my", "uk", "vi", "ar", "pl"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/OscarSchwartz_2015X", "views": "876,253"}
