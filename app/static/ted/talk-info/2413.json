Economist Yanis Varoufakis, the former Minister of Finance for Greece, says that it's because you can be in politics today but not be in power -- because real power now belongs to those who control the economy. He believes that the mega-rich and corporations are cannibalizing the political sphere, causing financial crisis. In this talk, hear his dream for a world in which capital and labor no longer struggle against each other, \"one that is simultaneously libertarian, Marxist and Keynesian.\"", "author": "Yanis Varoufakis", "keywords": "TED, talks, activism, big problems, economics, democracy, business, finance, global issues, investment, government, politics, Europe, society, capitalism, money, United States", "talk_id": "2413", "lang": ["el", "en", "zh", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "id", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "zh-Hans", "ro", "fr", "hr", "de", "hu", "fa", "fi", "da", "ja", "he", "ka", "sr", "sq", "ko", "sv", "mk", "uk", "gl", "bg", "ku", "tr"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/YanisVaroufakis_2015G", "views": "2,949,374"}
