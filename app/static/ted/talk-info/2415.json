In this tour-de-force talk, art historian Elizabeth Lev guides us across the famous building's ceiling and Michelangelo's vital depiction of traditional stories, showing how the painter reached beyond the religious iconography of the time to chart new artistic waters. Five hundred years after the artist painted it, says Lev, the Sistine Chapel forces us to look around as if it were a mirror and ask, \"Who am I, and what role do I play in this great theater of life?\"", "author": "Elizabeth Lev", "keywords": "TED, talks, Christianity, creativity, beauty, culture, history, God, museums, painting, visualizations, religion, art", "talk_id": "2415", "lang": ["eo", "el", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hans", "zh-Hant", "tr", "th", "fr", "de", "hu", "fa", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "pl", "ro"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/ElizabethLev_2015G", "views": "1,739,533"}
