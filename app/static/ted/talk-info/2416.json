Troubled by the way this law both harmed patients and created a barrier to biomedical innovation, Tania Simoncelli and her colleagues at the ACLU challenged it. In this riveting talk, hear the story of how they took a case everybody told them they would lose all the way to the Supreme Court.", "author": "Tania Simoncelli", "keywords": "TED, talks, activism, biotech, genetics, cancer, Debate, government, health, law, health care, medical research, nature, medicine, policy, public health, society, science, technology, TEDx, innovation, pharmaceuticals", "talk_id": "2416", "lang": ["pt-BR", "el", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "gl", "es", "ru", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "th", "fr", "bg", "de", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "my", "fa", "cs"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/TaniaSimoncelli_2014X", "views": "1,131,654"}
