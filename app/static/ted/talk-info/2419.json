The process of creating these robots leads to better automata that can be used for fieldwork, service, and search and rescue. But these robots don't just mimic the natural world -- they help us understand our own biology better, unlocking previously unknown secrets of the spinal cord.", "author": "Auke Ijspeert", "keywords": "TED, talks, animals, biomechanics, biotech, design, engineering, future, invention, innovation, biology, nature, robots, physics, technology, neuroscience", "talk_id": "2419", "lang": ["en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "es", "ru", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "fr", "bg", "de", "fa", "ja", "he", "ko", "uk", "nl", "hu", "pl", "el", "ro"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/AukeIjspeert_2015G", "views": "2,016,922"}
