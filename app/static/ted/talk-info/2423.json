But, says economist Dambisa Moyo, dogmatic capitalism isn't creating the growth we need. As she shows, in both state-sponsored and market-driven models, capitalism is failing to solve social ills, fostering corruption and creating income inequality. Moyo surveys the current economic landscape and suggests that we have to start thinking about capitalism as a spectrum so we can blend the best of different models together to foster growth.", "author": "Dambisa Moyo", "keywords": "TED, talks, business, capitalism, china, democracy, economics, future, finance, global issues, government, money, society, policy, United States, global development, markets", "talk_id": "2423", "lang": ["nl", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "id", "es", "ru", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "fr", "de", "hu", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "fa", "pl"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/DambisaMoyo_2015G", "views": "1,587,978"}
