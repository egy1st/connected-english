Sabeti immediately released her research online, so virus trackers and scientists from around the world could join in the urgent fight. In this talk, she shows how open cooperation was key to halting the virus ... and to attacking the next one to come along. \"We had to work openly, we had to share and we had to work together,\" Sabeti says. \"Let us not let the world be defined by the destruction wrought by one virus, but illuminated by billions of hearts and minds working in unity.\"", "author": "Pardis Sabeti", "keywords": "TED, talks, Africa, big problems, future, disease, ebola, genetics, global issues, humanity, health, illness, innovation, medicine, medical research, pandemic, public health, science", "talk_id": "2425", "lang": ["el", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "cs", "id", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "zh-Hans", "th", "ro", "pl", "fr", "sl", "de", "fa", "hi", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "sv", "uk", "mr", "gl", "hr", "tr", "hu"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/PardisSabeti_2015W", "views": "1,375,171"}
