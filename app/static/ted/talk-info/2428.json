Even today, many doctors still use race as a medical shortcut; they make important decisions about things like pain tolerance based on a patient's skin color instead of medical observation and measurement. In this searing talk, Roberts lays out the lingering traces of race-based medicine -- and invites us to be a part of ending it. \"It is more urgent than ever to finally abandon this backward legacy,\" she says, \"and to affirm our common humanity by ending the social inequalities that truly divide us.\"", "author": "Dorothy Roberts", "keywords": "TED, talks, big problems, activism, disease, inequality, health, health care, illness, medicine, medical research, public health, race, social change, law, Slavery, sociology, society", "talk_id": "2428", "lang": ["vi", "en", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "gl", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "zh-Hans", "th", "fr", "de", "fa", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "tr"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/DorothyRoberts_2015P", "views": "1,231,879"}
