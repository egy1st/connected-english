For trans people who don't fit neatly into the gender binary, public restrooms are a major source of anxiety and the place where they are most likely to be questioned or harassed. In this poetically rhythmic talk, Ivan Coyote grapples with complex and intensely personal issues of gender identity and highlights the need for gender-neutral bathrooms in all public places.", "author": "Ivan Coyote", "keywords": "TED, talks, design, gender, Gender spectrum, future, LGBT, social change, identity, TEDx, storytelling, Transgender", "talk_id": "2433", "lang": ["zh-Hant", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "cs", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "tr", "zh-Hans", "th", "fr", "de", "fa", "ja", "he", "ka", "sr", "ko", "uk", "pl", "ro"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/IvanCoyote_2015X", "views": "1,689,004"}
