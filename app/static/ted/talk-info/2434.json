Conservation photographer Thomas Peschak visits incredible seascapes around the world, and his photos reveal these hidden ecosystems. \"You can't love something and become a champion for it if you don't know it exists,\" he says. Join Peschak in a new, immersive TED Talk format as he shares his stunning work and his dream for a future of respectful coexistence with the ocean.", "author": "Thomas Peschak", "keywords": "TED, talks, adventure, biodiversity, beauty, animals, curiosity, conservation, environment, fish, exploration, global issues, future, nature, mission blue, photography, sustainability, water, oceans, science and art, ecology, marine biology", "talk_id": "2434", "lang": ["el", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "cs", "et", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "lv", "zh-Hans", "th", "ro", "pl", "fr", "bg", "fr-CA", "de", "fa", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "sk", "uk", "ku"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/ThomasPeschak_2015Z", "views": "1,101,284"}
