In this mind-bending talk, Adams breaks down what happened when, in September 2015, LIGO detected an unthinkably small anomaly, leading to one of the most exciting discoveries in the history of physics.", "author": "Allan Adams", "keywords": "TED, talks, astronomy, cosmos, curiosity, exploration, nature, physics, science, technology, universe, space", "talk_id": "2439", "lang": ["el", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "cs", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "th", "ro", "pl", "be", "fr", "bg", "hr", "de", "hu", "fa", "fi", "ja", "he", "ka", "sr", "ko", "sv", "my", "lv"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/AllanAdams_2016", "views": "2,710,262"}
