But as the company took off, co-founder Travis Kalanick wondered if there was a way to get people using Uber along the same routes to share rides, reducing costs and carbon footprint along the way. The result: uberPOOL, the company's carpooling service, which in its first eight months took 7.9 million miles off the roads and 1,400 metric tons of carbon dioxide out of the air in Los Angeles. Now, Kalanick says carpooling could work for commuters in the suburbs, too. \"With the technology in our pockets today, and a little smart regulation,\" he says, \"we can turn every car into a shared car, and we can reclaim our cities starting today.\"", "author": "Travis Kalanick", "keywords": "TED, talks, business, Brand, cars, cities, economics, entrepreneur, environment, future, green, innovation, Internet, investment, mobility, invention, technology, software, transportation, pollution, society, potential, web, sustainability, driverless cars", "talk_id": "2443", "lang": ["el", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "fr", "bg", "de", "fa", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "uk", "pl"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/TravisKalanick_2016", "views": "1,852,013"}
