In this insightful talk, he offers four ways to change the way we treat refugees, so they can make an immediate contribution to their new homes. \"There's nothing inevitable about refugees being a cost,\" Betts says. \"They're human beings with skills, talents, aspirations, with the ability to make contributions -- if we let them.\"", "author": "Alexander Betts", "keywords": "TED, talks, big problems, disaster relief, economics, Europe, fear, failure, future, global issues, government, Middle East, policy, potential, security, social change, refugees, Syria", "talk_id": "2449", "lang": ["eu", "el", "en", "vi", "ca", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "fr", "de", "hu", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "mk", "fa"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/AlexanderBetts_2016", "views": "960,505"}
