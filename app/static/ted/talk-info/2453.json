In this searching talk, Adam Foss, a prosecutor with the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office in Boston, makes his case for a reformed justice system that replaces wrath with opportunity, changing people's lives for the better instead of ruining them.", "author": "Adam Foss", "keywords": "TED, talks, big problems, choice, compassion, decision-making, education, government, inequality, criminal justice, law, race, policy, social change, society, justice system", "talk_id": "2453", "lang": ["ar", "el", "en", "vi", "it", "pt-BR", "es", "ru", "nl", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "sv", "hu", "fa", "pl", "mn", "lv", "fr", "ro", "ka"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/AdamFoss_2016", "views": "2,290,432"}
