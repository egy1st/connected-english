In a rare interview with TED Curator Chris Anderson, Torvalds discusses with remarkable openness the personality traits that prompted his unique philosophy of work, engineering and life. \"I am not a visionary, I'm an engineer,\" Torvalds says. \"I'm perfectly happy with all the people who are walking around and just staring at the clouds ... but I'm looking at the ground, and I want to fix the pothole that's right in front of me before I fall in.\"", "author": "Linus Torvalds", "keywords": "TED, talks, code, data, computers, communication, engineering, Internet, invention, interview, programming, technology, web", "talk_id": "2464", "lang": ["el", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "cs", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "th", "ro", "fr", "bg", "hu", "fa", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "sv", "uk", "et", "gl", "id", "az"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/LinusTorvalds_2016", "views": "4,916,229"}
