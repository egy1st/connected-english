To defeat it, says medical researcher and educator Paula Hammond, we need a new and powerful mode of attack. With her colleagues at MIT, Hammond engineered a nanoparticle one-hundredth the size of a human hair that can treat the most aggressive, drug-resistant cancers. Learn more about this molecular superweapon and join Hammond's quest to fight a disease that affects us all.", "author": "Paula Hammond", "keywords": "TED, talks, biotech, cancer, big problems, biomechanics, disease, genetics, engineering, health, invention, medicine, medical research, microbiology, nanoscale, technology, science", "talk_id": "2467", "lang": ["en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "cs", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "tr", "zh-Hans", "th", "ro", "fr", "de", "fa", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "mk", "uk", "zh-Hant", "hu", "pl"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/PaulaHammond_2015P", "views": "1,601,937"}
