As astronomer Tabetha Boyajian investigated this perplexing celestial object, a colleague suggested something unusual: Could it be an alien-built megastructure? Such an extraordinary idea would require extraordinary evidence. In this talk, Boyajian gives us a look at how scientists search for and test hypotheses when faced with the unknown.", "author": "Tabetha Boyajian", "keywords": "TED, talks, exploration, extraterrestrial life, NASA, nature, Planets, astronomy, science, universe, technology, telescopes", "talk_id": "2468", "lang": ["el", "en", "vi", "it", "sv", "ar", "pt-BR", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "th", "fr", "hu", "fa", "ja", "he", "ka", "sr", "ko", "uk", "pl"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/TabethaBoyajian_2016", "views": "7,289,511"}
