Using synthetic biology, Lisa Nip hopes to harness special powers from microbes on Earth -- such as the ability to withstand radiation -- to make humans more fit for exploring space. \"We're approaching a time during which we'll have the capacity to decide our own genetic destiny,\" Nip says. \"Augmenting the human body with new abilities is no longer a question of how, but of when.\"", "author": "Lisa Nip", "keywords": "TED, talks, TEDx, bacteria, biology, environment, engineering, exploration, evolution, future, innovation, microbiology, intelligence, nature, Planets, potential, science, astrobiology", "talk_id": "2471", "lang": ["el", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "cs", "id", "es", "ru", "nl", "lv", "zh-Hans", "th", "pl", "fr", "bg", "de", "fa", "fi", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "zh-Hant", "pt", "tr"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/LisaNip_2015X", "views": "1,723,351"}
