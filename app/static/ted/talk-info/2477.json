In this uplifting and personal talk, learn more about how this new understanding of our place in the world is galvanizing people to take action in the fights against extreme poverty, climate change, gender inequality and more. \"These are ultimately global issues,\" Evans says, \"and they can only be solved by global citizens demanding global solutions from their leaders.\"", "author": "Hugh Evans", "keywords": "TED, talks, activism, big problems, communication, collaboration, community, future, global issues, government, identity, humanity, inequality, policy, politics, climate change, social change, social media", "talk_id": "2477", "lang": ["el", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "cs", "id", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "lt", "th", "ro", "fr", "bg", "fa", "hi", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "sv", "mk"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/HughEvans_2016", "views": "1,705,259"}
