Paleontologist Kenneth Lacovara details his unearthing of Dreadnoughtus -- a 77-million-year-old sauropod that was as tall as a two-story house and as heavy as a jumbo jet -- and considers how amazingly improbable it is that a tiny mammal living in the cracks of the dinosaur world could evolve into a sentient being capable of understanding these magnificent creatures. Join him in a celebration of the Earth's geological history and contemplate our place in deep time.", "author": "Kenneth Lacovara", "keywords": "TED, talks, adventure, ancient world, animals, environment, dinosaurs, geology, exploration, humanity, history, nature, paleontology, science, universe, asteroid, TED Books", "talk_id": "2484", "lang": ["fr", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "zh-Hans", "th", "pl", "bg", "de", "fa", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "sv", "uk", "tr"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/KennethLacovara_2016", "views": "2,152,786"}
