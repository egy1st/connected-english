Now, as scientist and entrepreneur Riccardo Sabatini shows us, we have the power to read this complex code, predicting things like height, eye color, age and even facial structure -- all from a vial of blood. And soon, Sabatini says, our new understanding of the genome will allow us to personalize treatments for diseases like cancer. We have the power to change life as we know it. How will we use it?", "author": "Riccardo Sabatini", "keywords": "TED, talks, biology, choice, complexity, biotech, DNA, genetics, disease, future, humanity, health, medical research, identity, medicine, nature, potential, science, technology, machine learning", "talk_id": "2490", "lang": ["el", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "th", "de", "hu", "fa", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "fr", "pl", "hr", "bg", "gl"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/RiccardoSabatini_2016", "views": "1,836,495"}
