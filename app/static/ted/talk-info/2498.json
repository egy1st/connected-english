Physician, bioengineer and entrepreneur Sangeeta Bhatia leads a multidisciplinary lab that searches for novel ways to understand, diagnose and treat human disease. Her target: the two-thirds of deaths due to cancer that she says are fully preventable. With remarkable clarity, she breaks down complex nanoparticle science and shares her dream for a radical new cancer test that could save millions of lives.", "author": "Sangeeta Bhatia", "keywords": "TED, talks, medical research, big problems, biotech, cancer, disease, future, health, health care, illness, life, innovation, medicine, potential, technology, science", "talk_id": "2498", "lang": ["el", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "id", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "th", "ro", "fr", "fa", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "sk", "uk", "hu", "pl"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/SangeetaBhatia_2015P", "views": "906,592"}
