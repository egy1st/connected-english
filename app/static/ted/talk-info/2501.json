Do you think you can easily detect their lies? Developmental researcher Kang Lee studies what happens physiologically to children when they lie. They do it a lot, starting as young as two years old, and they're actually really good at it. Lee explains why we should celebrate when kids start to lie and presents new lie-detection technology that could someday reveal our hidden emotions.", "author": "Kang Lee", "keywords": "TED, talks, body language, communication, decision-making, intelligence, teaching, motivation, parenting, children, psychology, emotions", "talk_id": "2501", "lang": ["el", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "cs", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "sw", "zh-Hant", "tr", "lv", "zh-Hans", "lt", "th", "ro", "ca", "fr", "bg", "uk", "de", "fa", "bs", "ja", "he", "sr", "sq", "mn", "ko", "ur", "sk", "mr", "my", "id", "pl", "ku", "hu"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/KangLee_2016", "views": "8,689,473"}
