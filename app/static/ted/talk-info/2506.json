Activist Juno Mac explains four legal models that are being used around the world and shows us the model that she believes will work best to keep sex workers safe and offer greater self-determination. \"If you care about gender equality or poverty or migration or public health, then sex worker rights matter to you,\" she says. \"Make space for us in your movements.\" (Adult themes)", "author": "Juno Mac", "keywords": "TED, talks, activism, community, empathy, feminism, global issues, government, inequality, identity, law, policy, social change, sex, society, TEDx, women, trafficking, sexual violence", "talk_id": "2506", "lang": ["th", "el", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "es", "ru", "pt", "zh-Hant", "zh-Hans", "fr", "hr", "da", "fa", "hu", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "sv", "nl", "cs", "ro", "tr"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/JunoMac_2016X", "views": "2,640,686"}
