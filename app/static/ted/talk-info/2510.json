In this fascinating talk, neuroscientist Mariano Sigman reflects on ancient Greece and the origins of introspection to investigate how our words hint at our inner lives and details a word-mapping algorithm that could predict the development of schizophrenia. \"We may be seeing in the future a very different form of mental health,\" Sigman says, \"based on objective, quantitative and automated analysis of the words we write, of the words we say.\"", "author": "Mariano Sigman", "keywords": "TED, talks, cognitive science, communication, future, identity, health, language, mental health, mind, science, neuroscience, speech, self, writing, brain", "talk_id": "2510", "lang": ["pt", "de", "el", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "cs", "id", "es", "ru", "nl", "zh-Hant", "tr", "th", "pl", "fr", "bg", "hu", "fa", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "mk", "hr", "te", "et", "gl", "zh-Hans", "uk"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/MarianoSigman_2016", "views": "3,148,841"}
