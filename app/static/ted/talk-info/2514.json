It's already helped cut HIV transmission from mothers to babies by nearly half in sub-Saharan Africa, and now it's being used to address alarming infant mortality rates all over the world. The goal: to save lives by bringing the right interventions to the right populations at the right time.", "author": "Sue Desmond-Hellmann", "keywords": "TED, talks, Africa, communication, disease, future, big problems, health, global issues, HIV, health care, inequality, illness, innovation, medical research, medicine, parenting, public health", "talk_id": "2514", "lang": ["en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "id", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "zh-Hans", "fr", "de", "hu", "fa", "he", "sr", "mn", "ko", "ro", "ja", "tr"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/SueDesmondHellmann_2016", "views": "1,026,096"}
