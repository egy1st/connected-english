In this uproarious talk/stand-up hybrid, Farsad speaks on her documentary, The Muslims Are Coming!, narrates her fight with the MTA in New York and offers a detailed breakdown of the different types of haters she's encountered in her work. \"Comedy is one of our best weapons,\" she says. \"We've tried a lot of approaches to social justice, like war and competitive ice dancing -- but a lot of things are still kind of awful. I think it's time we try and tell a really good poop joke.\"", "author": "Negin Farsad", "keywords": "TED, talks, activism, community, comedy, identity, entertainment, religion, social change, society, TED Fellows, terrorism, humor", "talk_id": "2521", "lang": ["el", "vi", "en", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "es", "ru", "nl", "zh-Hant", "tr", "lt", "fr", "de", "fa", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "sv", "pt", "zh-Hans", "uk", "th", "pl"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/NeginFarsad_2016U", "views": "1,414,018"}
