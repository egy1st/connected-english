Instead, we must find alternative ways to conduct conflict that are equally powerful and effective. Raqib promotes nonviolent resistance to people living under tyranny -- and there's a lot more to it than street protests. She shares encouraging examples of creative strategies that have led to change around the world and a message of hope for a future without armed conflict. \"The greatest hope for humanity lies not in condemning violence but in making violence obsolete,\" Raqib says.", "author": "Jamila Raqib", "keywords": "TED, talks, collaboration, big problems, global issues, communication, community, humanity, military, protests, society, security, terrorism, violence, war, nonviolence", "talk_id": "2524", "lang": ["hu", "el", "en", "vi", "ar", "pt-BR", "id", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "th", "ro", "fr", "hr", "de", "fa", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "mk", "sk", "uk", "my", "it", "pl"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/JamilaRaqib_2015P", "views": "978,644"}
