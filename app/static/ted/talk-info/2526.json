She's looking to meet this goal by seeking reforms that will work in every school without additional resources. Bansal and her team have found success using creative, straightforward techniques such as communicating with teachers using SMS group chats, and they have already measurably improved learning and engagement in Haryana's schools.", "author": "Seema Bansal", "keywords": "TED, talks, children, communication, community, education, india, policy, potential, global issues, global development", "talk_id": "2526", "lang": ["el", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "id", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "th", "ro", "ta", "fr", "hu", "fa", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "uk", "cs", "sk", "de", "hr", "pl", "my"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/SeemaBansal_2016S", "views": "1,526,806"}
