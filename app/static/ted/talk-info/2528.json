The rest of the world is virtually unrepresented -- and this is dangerous, says geneticist and TED Fellow Keolu Fox, because we react to drugs differently based on our genetic makeup. Fox is working to democratize genome sequencing, specifically by advocating for indigenous populations to get involved in research, with the goal of eliminating health disparities. \"The research community needs to immerse itself in indigenous culture,\" he says, \"or die trying.\"", "author": "Keolu Fox", "keywords": "TED, talks, activism, community, health, inequality, big problems, medical research, genetics, medicine, health care, science, society, TED Fellows, indigenous peoples", "talk_id": "2528", "lang": ["pt", "zh-Hans", "el", "en", "ca", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "cs", "id", "es", "ru", "nl", "zh-Hant", "th", "fr", "fa", "he", "sr", "ko", "sv", "mk", "my", "ja", "vi", "pl", "tr", "uk", "gl"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/KeoluFox_2016U", "views": "940,772"}
