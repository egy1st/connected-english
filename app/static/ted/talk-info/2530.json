Psychologists like to talk about our traits, or defined characteristics that make us who we are. But Brian Little is more interested in moments when we transcend those traits -- sometimes because our culture demands it of us, and sometimes because we demand it of ourselves. Join Little as he dissects the surprising differences between introverts and extroverts and explains why your personality may be more malleable than you think.", "author": "Brian Little", "keywords": "TED, talks, communication, humanity, personality, identity, humor, self, psychology, introvert, TED Books", "talk_id": "2530", "lang": ["el", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "cs", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "lt", "fr", "hr", "de", "hu", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "sv", "mk", "uk", "fa", "et", "ro", "id", "ku"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/BrianLittle_2016", "views": "9,998,401"}
