In this eloquent talk, Michael Murphy shows how he and his team look far beyond the blueprint when they're designing. Considering factors from airflow to light, theirs is a holistic approach that produces community as well as (beautiful) buildings. He takes us on a tour of projects in countries such as Rwanda and Haiti, and reveals a moving, ambitious plan for The Memorial to Peace and Justice, which he hopes will heal hearts in the American South.", "author": "Michael Murphy", "keywords": "TED, talks, Africa, architecture, collaboration, beauty, community, design, health care, engineering, humanity, inequality, public health, materials, public spaces, social change, United States, society", "talk_id": "2532", "lang": ["ar", "fr", "ru", "zh-Hans", "it", "en", "pt-BR", "pt", "tr", "bg", "de", "fa", "ja", "sr", "ko", "uk", "he", "es", "vi", "th", "el", "zh-Hant"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/MichaelMurphy_2016", "views": "1,565,489"}
