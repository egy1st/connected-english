Blaise Ag\u00fcera y Arcas, principal scientist at Google, works with deep neural networks for machine perception and distributed learning. In this captivating demo, he shows how neural nets trained to recognize images can be run in reverse, to generate them. The results: spectacular, hallucinatory collages (and poems!) that defy categorization. \"Perception and creativity are very intimately connected,\" Ag\u00fcera y Arcas says. \"Any creature, any being that is able to do perceptual acts is also able to create.\"", "author": "Blaise Ag\u00fcera y Arcas", "keywords": "TED, talks, AI, algorithm, beauty, art, collaboration, brain, future, demo, innovation, intelligence, machine learning, science and art, science, visualizations", "talk_id": "2533", "lang": ["el", "vi", "nl", "en", "ca", "pt-BR", "es", "ru", "pt", "tr", "ro", "fr", "fa", "ja", "he", "ko", "uk", "ar", "th", "de", "it", "ka", "zh-Hant", "hu", "zh-Hans"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/BlaiseAguerayArcas_2016S", "views": "1,935,617"}
