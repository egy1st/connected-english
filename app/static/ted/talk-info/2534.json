When she lost her sight and was left without a way to do her science, she had a revelatory insight: the light curves she could no longer see could be translated into sound. Through sonification, she regained mastery over her work, and now she's advocating for a more inclusive scientific community. \"Science is for everyone,\" she says. \"It has to be available to everyone, because we are all natural explorers.\"", "author": "Wanda Diaz Merced", "keywords": "TED, talks, astronomy, collaboration, data, disability, energy, exploration, hearing, innovation, nature, physics, science, technology, blindness", "talk_id": "2534", "lang": ["tr", "sv", "el", "en", "vi", "it", "pt-BR", "es", "ru", "pt", "zh-Hant", "zh-Hans", "th", "ro", "pl", "fr", "hr", "hu", "he", "sr", "ko", "ar", "ja"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/WandaDiazMerced_2016", "views": "922,444"}
