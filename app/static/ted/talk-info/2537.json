Are you a soldier, prone to defending your viewpoint at all costs -- or a scout, spurred by curiosity? Julia Galef examines the motivations behind these two mindsets and how they shape the way we interpret information, interweaved with a compelling history lesson from 19th-century France. When your steadfast opinions are tested, Galef asks: \"What do you most yearn for? Do you yearn to defend your own beliefs or do you yearn to see the world as clearly as you possibly can?\"", "author": "Julia Galef", "keywords": "TED, talks, choice, communication, collaboration, identity, motivation, decision-making, leadership, personal growth, society, TEDx", "talk_id": "2537", "lang": ["ar", "el", "en", "zh", "vi", "ca", "pt-BR", "cs", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hans", "zh-Hant", "tr", "hr", "lt", "ro", "fr", "bg", "uk", "hu", "fa", "hi", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "sv", "my", "th", "pl", "it", "bn", "ka"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/JuliaGalef_2016X", "views": "4,087,348"}
