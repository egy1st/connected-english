Oppression, drought and religious differences all played key roles, but Marwa Al-Sabouni suggests another reason: architecture. Speaking to us over the Internet from Homs, where for the last six years she has watched the war tear her city apart, Al-Sabouni suggests that Syria's architecture divided its once tolerant and multicultural society into single-identity enclaves defined by class and religion. The country's future now depends on how it chooses to rebuild.", "author": "Marwa Al-Sabouni", "keywords": "TED, talks, architecture, community, violence, Middle East, big problems, cities, collaboration, design, engineering, disaster relief, identity, infrastructure, public spaces, potential, refugees, religion, social change, security, war, society, urban planning", "talk_id": "2541", "lang": ["it", "en", "vi", "ar", "pt-BR", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "zh-Hans", "ro", "fr", "de", "fa", "ja", "he", "sr", "sq", "ko", "sv", "mk", "uk", "pl", "hi", "cs"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/MarwaAlSabouni_2016V", "views": "1,056,218"}
