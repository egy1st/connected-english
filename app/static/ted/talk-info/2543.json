How do we now address that fear as well as growing disillusionment with the political establishment, while refusing to give in to xenophobia and nationalism? Join Betts as he discusses four post-Brexit steps toward a more inclusive world.", "author": "Alexander Betts", "keywords": "TED, talks, global issues, global development, big problems, choice, collaboration, communication, community, democracy, future, government, history, humanity, identity, immigration, inequality, Europe, news, policy, politics, refugees, social change, society", "talk_id": "2543", "lang": ["eo", "lt", "en", "zh", "it", "ar", "mk", "cs", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hans", "zh-Hant", "tr", "hr", "th", "ro", "pl", "fr", "hu", "fa", "ja", "he", "ka", "sr", "ko", "sv", "uk", "pt-BR", "el", "vi", "et"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/AlexanderBetts_2016T", "views": "3,576,171"}
