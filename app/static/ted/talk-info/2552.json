Tracing his lifelong love of costumes -- from a childhood space helmet made of an ice cream tub to a No-Face costume he wore to Comic-Con -- Savage explores the world of cosplay and the meaning it creates for its community. \"We're connecting with something important inside of us,\" he says. \"The costumes are how we reveal ourselves to each other.\"", "author": "Adam Savage", "keywords": "TED, talks, adventure, art, beauty, communication, collaboration, community, design, humor, entertainment, identity, materials, personality, performance, storytelling, creativity", "talk_id": "2552", "lang": ["en", "zh", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "th", "ro", "fr", "hr", "fa", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "sv", "sk", "uk", "tr", "zh-Hans", "de", "pl"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/AdamSavage_2016", "views": "2,868,967"}
