Rather than magnify these invisible structures with a microscope, he wondered: What if we physically enlarge them and make them easier to see? Learn how the same polymers used to make baby diapers swell could be a key to better understanding our brains.", "author": "Ed Boyden", "keywords": "TED, talks, brain, chemistry, humanity, life, innovation, materials, illness, medical research, nanoscale, biology, neuroscience, biomechanics, biotech, science, potential, technology", "talk_id": "2557", "lang": ["el", "en", "vi", "it", "ar", "pt-BR", "cs", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hant", "tr", "th", "ro", "pl", "fr", "bg", "fa", "ja", "he", "ko", "sr", "zh-Hans", "ka", "gl", "uk"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/EdBoyden_2016T", "views": "1,504,063"}
