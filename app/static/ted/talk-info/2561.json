It's from those who have won in this era of change, to those who have, or feel, lost. It confesses to ignoring pain until it became anger. It chides an idealistic yet remote elite for its behind-closed-doors world-saving and airy, self-serving futurism \u2014 for at times worrying more about sending people to Mars than helping them on Earth. And it rejects the exclusionary dogmas to which we cling, calling us instead to \"dare to commit to the dream of each other.\"", "author": "Anand Giridharadas", "keywords": "TED, talks, collaboration, communication, community, democracy, compassion, fear, government, humanity, history, identity, politics, society, social change", "talk_id": "2561", "lang": ["fi", "fr", "it", "en", "vi", "ar", "pt-BR", "ru", "nl", "pt", "zh-Hans", "he", "sr", "ko", "sv", "uk", "es", "tr", "zh-Hant", "el", "ja"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/AnandGiridharadas_2016T", "views": "1,042,175"}
