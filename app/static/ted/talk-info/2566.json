Satellite archaeologist Sarah Parcak is determined to find them before looters do. With the 2016 TED Prize, Parcak is building an online citizen-science tool called GlobalXplorer that will train an army of volunteer explorers to find and protect the world's hidden heritage. In this talk, she offers a preview of the first place they'll look: Peru -- the home of Machu Picchu, the Nazca lines and other archaeological wonders waiting to be discovered.", "author": "Sarah Parcak", "keywords": "TED, talks, adventure, ancient world, archaeology, conservation, culture, crowdsourcing, discovery, curiosity, global issues, exploration, history, innovation, humanity, space, technology, TED Prize, world cultures, TED Fellows, South America", "talk_id": "2566", "lang": ["el", "en", "zh", "vi", "it", "sv", "ar", "pt-BR", "es", "ru", "nl", "pt", "tr", "lv", "zh-Hans", "th", "ro", "fr", "bg", "de", "da", "ja", "he", "sr", "ko", "mk", "uk", "my", "fa", "zh-Hant", "pl"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/SarahParcak_2016T", "views": "1,176,627"}
