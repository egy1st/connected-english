After she was the victim of an assault in London, Wells published a letter to her attacker in a student newspaper that went viral and sparked the #NotGuilty campaign against sexual violence and victim-blaming. In this moving talk, she describes how sharing her personal story gave hope to others and delivers a powerful message against the culture of online shaming.", "author": "Ione Wells", "keywords": "TED, talks, activism, communication, community, journalism, Internet, social media, social change, violence, sexual violence", "talk_id": "2597", "lang": ["fr", "zh-Hans", "el", "en", "pt-BR", "nl", "fa", "hi", "he", "hr", "ru", "de", "sv", "ro", "es", "ja", "it", "vi", "pt", "ar", "uk", "tr", "hu", "ko", "zh-Hant"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/IoneWells_2016T", "views": "1,238,925"}
