A keen observer of the human spirit, Iyer professes that he now feels he knows far less about Japan -- or, indeed, about anything -- than he thought he knew three decades ago. In this lyrical meditation on wisdom, Iyer expands on this curious insight about knowledge gained with age: that the more we know, the more we see how little we know.", "author": "Pico Iyer", "keywords": "TED, talks, adventure, aging, humanity, identity, illusion, intelligence, personal growth, self, writing", "talk_id": "2598", "lang": ["bg", "ru", "ja", "el", "lt", "zh-Hans", "zh-Hant", "en", "ar", "pt-BR", "es", "pt", "de", "hu", "he", "sr", "ko", "my", "hr", "sv", "uk", "nl", "fr", "tr", "vi", "it", "id", "fa", "th", "ro", "sw", "ku"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/PicoIyer_2016T", "views": "1,828,412"}
