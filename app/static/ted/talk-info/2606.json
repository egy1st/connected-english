But the complex way AI grows and improves makes it hard to understand and even harder to control. In this cautionary talk, techno-sociologist Zeynep Tufekci explains how intelligent machines can fail in ways that don't fit human error patterns -- and in ways we won't expect or be prepared for. \"We cannot outsource our responsibilities to machines,\" she says. \"We must hold on ever tighter to human values and human ethics.\"", "author": "Zeynep Tufekci", "keywords": "TED, talks, AI, choice, computers, algorithm, data, humanity, decision-making, intelligence, machine learning, potential, morality, privacy, robots, society, science, software, technology", "talk_id": "2606", "lang": ["fa", "pt-BR", "fr", "en", "nl", "sr", "uk", "he", "ko", "sv", "es", "ru", "zh-Hans", "it", "zh-Hant", "ka", "ja", "pt", "tr", "pl", "ar", "th", "hu", "vi"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/ZeynepTufekci_2016T", "views": "1,650,327"}
