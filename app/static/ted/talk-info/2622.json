The perpetrator's story, that he killed them over a traffic dispute, went unquestioned by the media and police until Barakat spoke out at a press conference, calling the murders what they really were: hate crimes. As she reflects on how she and her family reclaimed control of their narrative, Barakat calls on us to speak up when we witness hateful bigotry and express our allyship with those who face discrimination.", "author": "Suzanne Barakat", "keywords": "TED, talks, activism, family, community, death, humanity, Islam, religion, love, social change, society", "talk_id": "2622", "lang": ["tr", "ka", "es", "de", "sv", "en", "nl", "pt", "th", "pt-BR", "id", "eu", "ar", "fr", "he", "uk", "ko", "zh-Hans", "it", "vi", "pl", "zh-Hant", "ru", "ja", "el", "fa"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/SuzanneBarakat_2016W", "views": "1,960,794"}
