In this poignant talk, Brea describes the obstacles she's encountered in seeking treatment for her condition, whose root causes and physical effects we don't fully understand, as well as her mission to document through film the lives of patients that medicine struggles to treat.", "author": "Jennifer Brea", "keywords": "TED, talks, activism, gender, health, gender equality, health care, history, medical research, illness, film, personal growth, medicine, pain, TED Fellows, women, science", "talk_id": "2627", "lang": ["en", "cs", "sv", "pt", "bg", "it", "uk", "es", "nl", "de", "fr", "pt-BR", "mr", "sr", "he", "ka", "ar", "ro", "ru", "hu", "ja", "da", "vi", "zh-Hant", "my", "ko", "id", "is", "pl", "lt", "el", "fi", "tr", "arq", "zh", "zh-Hans"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/JenniferBrea_2016T", "views": "2,045,498"}
