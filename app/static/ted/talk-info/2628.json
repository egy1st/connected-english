In a disarmingly hilarious talk, Toksvig tells the story of how she helped start a new political party in Britain, the Women's Equality Party, with the express purpose of putting equality on the ballot. Now she hopes people around the world will copy her party's model and mobilize for equality.", "author": "Sandi Toksvig", "keywords": "TED, talks, activism, feminism, gender equality, global issues, government, history, inequality, motivation, personal growth, politics, social change, society, women", "talk_id": "2628", "lang": ["es", "pt", "nl", "en", "fr", "sr", "de", "fa", "sv", "eu", "ko", "he", "ja", "pt-BR", "it", "ar", "hu", "ru", "zh-Hans", "zh-Hant", "uk", "lv", "vi", "tr"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/SandiToksvig_2016W", "views": "922,625"}
