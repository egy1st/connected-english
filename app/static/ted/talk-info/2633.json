His analysis of the world's energy realities puts a powerful lens on the stubbornly touchy issue of nuclear power, including new designs for plants that can compete economically with fossil fuels. We have the potential to make nuclear safer and cheaper than it's been in the past, Lassiter says. Now we have to make the choice to pursue it.", "author": "Joe Lassiter", "keywords": "TED, talks, alternative energy, choice, climate change, engineering, innovation, global issues, nuclear energy, pollution, potential, society, resources, science, electricity", "talk_id": "2633", "lang": ["en", "ar", "fa", "nl", "pt", "ka", "fr", "sv", "pt-BR", "es", "th", "he", "bs", "zh-Hant", "it", "uk", "tr", "ja", "ko", "ru", "zh-Hans", "vi", "de", "sk", "hu", "pl"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/JoeLassiter_2016T", "views": "1,193,388"}
