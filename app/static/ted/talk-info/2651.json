Biologist Paul Knoepfler estimates that within fifteen years, scientists could use the gene editing technology CRISPR to make certain \"upgrades\" to human embryos -- from altering physical appearances to eliminating the risk of auto-immune diseases. In this thought-provoking talk, Knoepfler readies us for the coming designer baby revolution and its very personal, and unforeseeable, consequences.", "author": "Paul Knoepfler", "keywords": "TED, talks, AIDS, bioethics, biology, biotech, children, choice, discovery, DNA, CRISPR, genetics, HIV, health, humanity, innovation, molecular biology, identity, nature, parenting, policy, science, social change, society, technology, TEDx", "talk_id": "2651", "lang": ["en", "he", "sr", "es", "ja", "nl", "fr", "pt-BR", "nb", "ru", "tr", "pt", "ko", "zh-Hant", "vi", "ar", "pl", "zh-Hans", "hu"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/PaulKnoepfler_2015X", "views": "1,465,572"}
