In this fun and accessible talk about how science happens, Beacham takes us on a journey through extra-spatial dimensions in search of undiscovered fundamental particles (and an explanation for the mysteries of gravity) and details the drive to keep exploring.", "author": "James Beacham", "keywords": "TED, talks, collaboration, dark matter, discovery, future, data, innovation, motivation, engineering, nature, physics, history, science, Nobel Prize, universe, TEDx, exploration, quantum physics", "talk_id": "2654", "lang": ["fa", "pt-BR", "ar", "en", "es", "fr", "gu", "it", "ja", "ko", "pt", "uk", "vi", "sr", "zh-Hant", "ru", "el", "tr", "ro", "zh-Hans"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/JamesBeacham_2016X", "views": "1,572,793"}
