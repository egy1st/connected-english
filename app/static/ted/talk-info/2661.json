We're struck, we're crushed, we swoon. We burn with passion. Love makes us crazy and makes us sick. Our hearts ache, and then they break. Talking about love in this way fundamentally shapes how we experience it, says writer Mandy Len Catron. In this talk for anyone who's ever felt crazy in love, Catron highlights a different metaphor for love that may help us find more joy -- and less suffering -- in it.", "author": "Mandy Len Catron", "keywords": "TED, talks, love, humanity, relationships, mental health, writing, TEDx, collaboration, communication, compassion, depression, empathy, happiness, personality, trust", "talk_id": "2661", "lang": ["en", "fr", "ar", "sr", "tr", "bg", "pt-BR", "pt", "hr", "hu", "be", "es", "nl", "ja", "ko", "it", "vi", "de", "zh-Hans", "ru", "el", "uk", "fa", "lt", "th", "my", "zh-Hant", "cs", "gl", "ro"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/MandyLenCatron_SFU_2015X", "views": "2,611,729"}
