We're studying an astonishingly narrow sliver of life, says biologist Alejandro S\u00e1nchez Alvarado, and hoping it'll be enough to solve the oldest, most challenging problems in science, like cancer. In this visually captivating talk, Alvarado calls on us to interrogate the unknown and shows us the remarkable discoveries that surface when we do.", "author": "Alejandro S\u00e1nchez Alvarado", "keywords": "TED, talks, animals, biodiversity, beauty, biology, biomechanics, biosphere, creativity, education, discovery, curiosity, exploration, environment, innovation, illness, intelligence, medical research, life, nature, medicine, neuroscience, oceans, physiology, science, TEDx, marine biology", "talk_id": "2663", "lang": ["es", "ar", "ca", "el", "en", "fr", "he", "it", "ja", "ko", "pl", "pt", "pt-BR", "ru", "sr", "tr", "uk", "bg", "th", "de", "zh-Hant", "vi", "zh-Hans"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/AlejandroAlvarado_2016X", "views": "1,329,870"}
