In this funny and thoughtful talk, Msimang questions our emphasis on storytelling and spotlights the decline of facts. During a critical time when listening has been confused for action, Msimang asks us to switch off our phones, step away from our screens and step out into the real world to create a plan for justice.", "author": "Sisonke Msimang", "keywords": "TED, talks, activism, Africa, communication, collaboration, community, empathy, humanity, journalism, global issues, inequality, motivation, news, Internet, society, personal growth, storytelling, social change, writing", "talk_id": "2665", "lang": ["en", "he", "ar", "sr", "nl", "pt", "hu", "el", "uk", "es", "tr", "vi", "it", "pt-BR", "fa", "de", "fr", "ja", "ko", "ru", "zh-Hant", "zh-Hans", "bg", "gl", "pl"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/SisonkeMsimang_2016W", "views": "1,365,877"}
