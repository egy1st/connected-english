As a social psychologist, he researches how moral values -- typically a source of division -- can also be used to bring people together. Willer shares compelling insights on how we might bridge the ideological divide and offers some intuitive advice on ways to be more persuasive when talking politics.", "author": "Robb Willer", "keywords": "TED, talks, communication, democracy, Debate, government, humanity, identity, language, empathy, morality, personal growth, politics, social change, society, TEDx, psychology", "talk_id": "2669", "lang": ["en", "es", "fa", "sr", "ar", "he", "cs", "fr", "ru", "ja", "nl", "ko", "it", "zh-Hans", "hu", "pt-BR", "zh-Hant", "pt", "ro", "vi", "da"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/RobbWiller_2016X", "views": "2,682,508"}
