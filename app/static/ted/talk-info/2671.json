Computers that improve our ability to think and imagine, and robotic systems that come up with (and build) radical new designs for bridges, cars, drones and much more -- all by themselves. Take a tour of the Augmented Age with futurist Maurice Conti and preview a time when robots and humans will work side-by-side to accomplish things neither could do alone.", "author": "Maurice Conti", "keywords": "TED, talks, AI, algorithm, computers, drones, future, engineering, humanity, innovation, invention, materials, product design, robots, technology, TEDx, manufacturing, design", "talk_id": "2671", "lang": ["en", "pt-BR", "sr", "fa", "ro", "es", "fi", "he", "it", "ru", "ko", "ja", "uk", "vi", "tr", "cs", "pl", "zh-Hans", "el", "zh-Hant", "ar", "fr", "hu"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/MauriceConti_2016X", "views": "6,187,687"}
