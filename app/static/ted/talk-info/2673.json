There's a lot to discover; in the Egyptian Delta alone, Parcak estimates we've excavated less than a thousandth of one percent of what's out there. Now, with the 2016 TED Prize and an infectious enthusiasm for archaeology, she's developed an online platform called GlobalXplorer that enables anyone with an internet connection to discover unknown sites and protect what remains of our shared human inheritance.", "author": "Sarah Parcak", "keywords": "TED, talks, adventure, ancient world, archaeology, big problems, collaboration, communication, community, algorithm, Egypt, global issues, humanity, human origins, Middle East, potential, science, society, South America, technology, TED Prize, terrorism, violence, war, world cultures", "talk_id": "2673", "lang": ["en", "hu", "sr", "pt", "es", "ja", "pt-BR", "fr", "vi", "sv", "hr", "ro", "tr", "ru", "ko", "zh-Hant", "el", "ar", "it", "he", "zh-Hans"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/SarahParcak_2016", "views": "1,004,294"}
