Researcher Joshua Smith is developing a nanobiotechnology \"cancer alarm\" that scans for traces of disease in the form of special biomarkers called exosomes. In this forward-thinking talk, he shares his dream for how we might revolutionize cancer detection and, ultimately, save lives.", "author": "Joshua Smith", "keywords": "TED, talks, biotech, biology, cancer, disease, health, future, health care, humanity, innovation, invention, nanoscale, motivation, science, technology", "talk_id": "2680", "lang": ["en", "fa", "fr", "uk", "pt", "ro", "ja", "ru", "hu", "nl", "pt-BR", "ar", "cs", "vi", "ko", "he", "es", "zh-Hant", "tr", "it", "zh-Hans", "de"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/JoshuaSmith_2016S", "views": "1,061,402"}
