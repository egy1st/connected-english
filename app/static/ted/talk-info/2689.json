Booch allays our worst (sci-fi induced) fears about superintelligent computers by explaining how we'll teach, not program, them to share our human values. Rather than worry about an unlikely existential threat, he urges us to consider how artificial intelligence will enhance human life.", "author": "Grady Booch", "keywords": "TED, talks, AI, algorithm, brain, cognitive science, communication, data, computers, engineering, design, future, fear, identity, humanity, intelligence, innovation, language, invention, mind, machine learning, robots, philosophy, society, science, technology, software", "talk_id": "2689", "lang": ["en", "sr", "fa", "de", "fr", "zh", "hr", "tr", "ja", "ko", "vi", "my", "zh-Hans", "hu", "ru", "he", "cs", "pt", "ar", "pt-BR", "es", "ro", "uk", "az", "gl", "it", "pl", "zh-Hant"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/GradyBooch_2016S", "views": "2,867,827"}
