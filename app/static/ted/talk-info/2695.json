In a wide-ranging conversation full of insight, historian Yuval Harari places our current turmoil in a broader context, against the ongoing disruption of our technology, climate, media -- even our notion of what humanity is for. This is the first of a series of TED Dialogues, seeking a thoughtful response to escalating political divisiveness. Make time (just over an hour) for this fascinating discussion between Harari and TED curator Chris Anderson.", "author": "Yuval Noah Harari", "keywords": "TED, talks, big problems, climate change, collaboration, democracy, future, economics, global development, global issues, history, humanity, identity, government, human origins, intelligence, media, news, politics, social change, society, technology, violence, war", "talk_id": "2695", "lang": ["en", "sr", "nl", "el", "pt", "ko", "it", "fa", "fr", "he", "ru", "tr", "zh-Hant", "pt-BR", "es", "vi", "ja", "hu", "zh-Hans", "ar", "sk", "fi"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/YuvalNoahHarari_2017S", "views": "2,983,997"}
