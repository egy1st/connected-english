Now she's on a mission to fight bias in machine learning, a phenomenon she calls the \"coded gaze.\" It's an eye-opening talk about the need for accountability in coding ... as algorithms take over more and more aspects of our lives.", "author": "Joy Buolamwini", "keywords": "TED, talks, activism, algorithm, AI, code, data, identity, inequality, product design, innovation, programming, software, TEDx, technology, race", "talk_id": "2705", "lang": ["en", "he", "fr", "pt-BR", "vi", "pt", "ar", "tr", "es", "th", "it", "fa", "sr", "ru", "ja", "ko", "sv", "hu", "zh-Hans", "de", "zh-Hant", "cs"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/JoyBuolamwini_2016X", "views": "1,226,041"}
