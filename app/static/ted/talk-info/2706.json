As theater director Jude Kelly points out in this passionately reasoned talk, that skew affects how we interpret even non-fictional women's stories and rights. She thinks there's a more useful, more inclusive way to look at the world, and she calls on artists -- women and men -- to paint, draw, write about, film and imagine a gender-equal society.", "author": "Jude Kelly", "keywords": "TED, talks, activism, children, communication, art, entertainment, humanity, gender equality, inequality, performance art, literature, motivation, social change, women, poetry, theater", "talk_id": "2706", "lang": ["en", "es", "pt", "ru", "fr", "fa", "ja", "sr", "ar", "ro", "he", "bn", "uk", "tr", "ko", "zh-Hant", "pt-BR", "de", "vi", "ca", "th", "ur", "el", "it", "zh-Hans"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/JudeKelly_2016W", "views": "1,250,465"}
