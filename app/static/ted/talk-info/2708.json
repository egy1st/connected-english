For three years, author Peggy Orenstein interviewed girls ages 15 to 20 about their attitudes toward and experiences of sex. She discusses the pleasure that's largely missing from their sexual encounters and calls on us to close the \"orgasm gap\" by talking candidly with our girls from an early age about sex, bodies, pleasure and intimacy.", "author": "Peggy Orenstein", "keywords": "TED, talks, children, communication, family, empathy, feminism, gender equality, inequality, parenting, humanity, relationships, sex, social change, women, society", "talk_id": "2708", "lang": ["en", "pt", "bg", "pl", "he", "it", "pt-BR", "fa", "cs", "zh-Hant", "ko", "ru", "es", "nl", "et", "fr", "ar", "ro", "vi", "tr", "ca", "hu", "ja", "zh-Hans", "mk", "sl"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/PeggyOrenstein_2016W", "views": "3,674,410"}
