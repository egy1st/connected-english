We can't see it, but its event horizon casts a shadow, and an image of that shadow could help answer some important questions about the universe. Scientists used to think that making such an image would require a telescope the size of Earth -- until Katie Bouman and a team of astronomers came up with a clever alternative. Bouman explains how we can take a picture of the ultimate dark using the Event Horizon Telescope.", "author": "Katie Bouman", "keywords": "TED, talks, astronomy, collaboration, exploration, innovation, nature, science, physics, science and art, technology, universe, TEDx, visualizations, space, telescopes", "talk_id": "2723", "lang": ["en", "hu", "sr", "th", "pt-BR", "nl", "zh-Hans", "ru", "tr", "he", "ar", "lt", "el", "uk", "ja", "fa", "fr", "es", "vi", "zh-Hant", "ko", "it", "sk", "cs", "id"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/KatieBouman_2016X", "views": "5,458,029"}
