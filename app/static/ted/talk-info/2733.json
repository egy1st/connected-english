What resulted was a video game, \"That Dragon, Cancer,\" which takes players on a journey they can't win. In this beautiful talk about coping with loss, Green brings joy and play to tragedy. \"We made a game that's hard to play,\" she says, \"because the hardest moments of our lives change us more than any goal we could ever accomplish.\"", "author": "Amy Green", "keywords": "TED, talks, art, children, communication, cancer, collaboration, humanity, death, technology, gaming, life, parenting, TEDNYC", "talk_id": "2733", "lang": ["en", "pt-BR", "vi", "nl", "el", "zh-Hans", "cs", "hr", "es", "uk", "de", "ro", "pt", "ko", "fa", "ar", "fr", "tr", "he", "sr", "ru", "ja", "it", "hu", "th", "zh-Hant", "id"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/AmyGreen_2017S", "views": "1,617,158"}
