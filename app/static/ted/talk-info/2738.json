Take, for example, the environmental crisis that recently unfolded in Flint, Michigan -- and the professionals there who did nothing to fix it. Siddhartha Roy helped prove that Flint's water was contaminated, and he tells a story of science in service to the public good, calling on the next generation of scientists and engineers to dedicate their work to protecting people and the planet.", "author": "Siddhartha Roy", "keywords": "TED, talks, science, activism, public health, algorithm, community, communication, engineering, environment, health, humanity, society, TEDx, water", "talk_id": "2738", "lang": ["en", "es", "pt-BR", "zh-Hant", "ru", "nl", "fr", "pt", "tr", "ko", "my", "it", "he", "ja", "vi", "hu", "ar", "de", "zh-Hans", "uk"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/SiddharthaRoy_2016X", "views": "1,061,449"}
