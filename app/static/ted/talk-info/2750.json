And why turbulence? I really believe he will have an answer for the first.\" As difficult as turbulence is to understand mathematically, we can use art to depict the way it looks. Natalya St. Clair illustrates how Van Gogh captured this deep mystery of movement, fluid and light in his work. [Directed by Avi Ofer, narrated by Addison Anderson].
