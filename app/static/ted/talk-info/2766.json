You happen to be standing next to a switch that will divert the trolley onto a second track. Here's the problem: that track has a worker on it, too \u2014 but just one. What do you do? Do you sacrifice one person to save five? Eleanor Nelsen details the ethical dilemma that is the trolley problem. [Directed Eoin Duffy, narrated by Addison Anderson, sound by David Kamp].
