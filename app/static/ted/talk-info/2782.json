Triona McGrath researches this process, known as ocean acidification, and in this talk she takes us for a dive into an oceanographer's world. Learn more about how the \"evil twin of climate change\" is impacting the ocean -- and the life that depends on it.", "author": "Triona McGrath", "keywords": "TED, talks, animals, biodiversity, biosphere, biology, environment, chemistry, climate change, nature, future, oceans, pollution, science, water, TEDx, marine biology, global commons", "talk_id": "2782", "lang": ["en", "pt", "de", "tr", "nl", "he", "it", "fa", "fr", "sr", "pt-BR", "ro", "zh-Hant", "ru", "el", "hi", "ar", "ja", "hu", "te", "ko", "es", "vi", "hr", "nb", "cs", "id", "zh-Hans"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/TrionaMcGrath_2016X", "views": "1,511,610"}
