Understanding how they form and how they'll change is important for those that call their banks and deltas home. In this visual-packed talk, geoscientist Liz Hajek shows us how rocks deposited by ancient rivers can be used as a time machine to study the history of the earth, so we can figure out how to more sustainably live on it today.", "author": "Liz Hajek", "keywords": "TED, talks, ancient world, environment, climate change, nature, science, water, TEDx, rivers, global commons", "talk_id": "2814", "lang": ["en", "ru", "he", "zh-Hans", "es", "pt-BR", "uk", "hu", "ja", "ro", "it", "ar", "tr", "vi", "zh-Hant", "el", "ko", "ku", "pl", "fr", "cs", "fa", "pt"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/LizHajek_2014X", "views": "1,412,358"}
