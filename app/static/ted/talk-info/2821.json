He shares a breakthrough technique that looks for small signals of cancer's presence via a simple blood test, detecting the recurrence of some forms of the disease 100 days earlier than traditional methods. It could be a ray of hope in a fight where early detection makes all the difference.", "author": "Jimmy Lin", "keywords": "TED, talks, biology, cancer, disease, DNA, health, epidemiology, innovation, medical research, medicine, TED Fellows, science", "talk_id": "2821", "lang": ["en", "pt-BR", "pt", "mk", "nl", "fa", "es", "ru", "zh-Hant", "ro", "hr", "sw", "ja", "vi", "fr", "ar", "lt", "el", "tr", "de", "ko", "sv", "zh-Hans", "uk", "be"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/JimmyLin_2017U", "views": "1,472,236"}
