Marc Raibert, founder of Boston Dynamics, is developing advanced robots that can gallop like a cheetah, negotiate 10 inches of snow, walk upright on two legs and even open doors and deliver packages. Join Raibert for a live demo of SpotMini, a nimble robot that maps the space around it, handles objects, climbs stairs -- and could soon be helping you out around the house.", "author": "Marc Raibert", "keywords": "TED, talks, robots, future, demo, technology, design", "talk_id": "2825", "lang": ["en", "es", "fa", "ro", "ko", "ja", "ru", "zh-Hant", "uk", "ar", "fr", "vi", "hr", "pt-BR", "tr", "hu", "el", "zh-Hans", "nl"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/MarcRaibert_2017", "views": "4,095,886"}
