For the past 24 years, she's helped decide what appears on the magazine's famous cover, from the black-on-black depiction of the Twin Towers the week after 9/11 to a recent, Russia-influenced riff on the magazine's mascot, Eustace Tilley. In this visual retrospective, Mouly considers how a simple drawing can cut through the torrent of images that we see every day and elegantly capture the feeling (and the sensibility) of a moment in time.", "author": "Fran\u00e7oise Mouly", "keywords": "TED, talks, art, culture, creativity, design, humor, TEDNYC", "talk_id": "2828", "lang": ["en", "sr", "hr", "pt-BR", "uk", "ru", "he", "pt", "hu", "zh-Hant", "ja", "ro", "vi", "fa", "de", "es", "it", "ko", "fr", "ar", "zh-Hans", "tr"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/FrancoiseMouly_2017S", "views": "1,251,468"}
