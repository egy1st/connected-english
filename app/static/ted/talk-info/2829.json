Today, computer vision systems do it with greater than 99 percent accuracy. How? Joseph Redmon works on the YOLO (You Only Look Once) system, an open-source method of object detection that can identify objects in images and video -- from zebras to stop signs -- with lightning-quick speed. In a remarkable live demo, Redmon shows off this important step forward for applications like self-driving cars, robotics and even cancer detection.", "author": "Joseph Redmon", "keywords": "TED, talks, algorithm, AI, computers, sight, technology", "talk_id": "2829", "lang": ["en", "fa", "ar", "ja", "he", "uk", "pt-BR", "zh-Hant", "vi", "es", "lt", "tr", "de", "hu", "ru", "fr", "pt", "ko", "gl", "it", "pl", "hi", "hr", "id", "nl", "zh-Hans"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/JosephRedmon_2017", "views": "2,475,218"}
