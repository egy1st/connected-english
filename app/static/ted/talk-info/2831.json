He shares heartbreaking stories of how (and why) people end up being put in jail for something they didn't do, and the consequences in their lives and the lives of others. Watch this essential talk about the duty we all have to make the world a bit more fair every day, however we can.", "author": "Ronald Sullivan", "keywords": "TED, talks, criminal justice, inequality, law, social change, TEDx, society, United States, justice system", "talk_id": "2831", "lang": ["en", "ro", "he", "uk", "sr", "pt-BR", "fr", "pt", "vi", "ru", "ko", "tr", "ar", "ja", "it", "es", "zh-Hant", "pl", "cs", "zh-Hans"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/RonaldSullivan_2016X", "views": "886,465"}
