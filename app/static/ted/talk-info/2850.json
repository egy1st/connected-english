What are they trying to tell us? Your blood type, for one -- and, potentially, that you have cancer. Chemical biologist Carolyn Bertozzi researches how sugars on cancerous cells interact with (and sometimes trick) your immune system. Learn more about how your body detects cancer and how the latest cancer-fighting medicines could help your immune system beat the disease.", "author": "Carolyn Bertozzi", "keywords": "TED, talks, biology, cancer, disease, chemistry, health, biomechanics, human body, illness, medical research, science, medicine", "talk_id": "2850", "lang": ["en", "cs", "hi", "pt", "th", "hr", "pt-BR", "ar", "ja", "fa", "sv", "es", "tr", "de", "lt", "ko", "bs", "zh-Hant", "fr", "ru", "nb", "hu", "zh-Hans", "it", "vi"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/CarolynBertozzi_2016X", "views": "1,528,665"}
