He presents his latest projects -- from a bike path in Eindhoven, where he reinterpreted \"The Starry Night\" to get people thinking about green energy, to Beijing, where he developed a smog vacuum cleaner to purify the air in local parks, to a dance floor that generates electricity to power a DJ booth.
