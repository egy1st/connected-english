But sometimes our small-group identities can keep us from connecting with humanity as a whole -- and even keep us from seeing others as human. In a powerful talk about how we understand who we are, Chetan Bhatt challenges us to think creatively about each other and our future. As he puts it: it's time to change the question from \"Where are you from?\" to \"Where are you going?\"", "author": "Chetan Bhatt", "keywords": "TED, talks, community, humanity, identity, inequality, race, personal growth, social change, religion, society, TEDx, india", "talk_id": "2864", "lang": ["en", "es", "hr", "he", "hu", "sr", "it", "pt-BR", "tr", "ko", "zh-Hant", "ru", "fr", "fa", "ja", "uk", "ar"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/ChetanBhatt_2015X", "views": "1,389,089"}
