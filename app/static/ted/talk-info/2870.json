Robotics engineer Radhika Nagpal studies the collective intelligence displayed by insects and fish schools, seeking to understand their rules of engagement. In a visionary talk, she presents her work creating artificial collective power and previews a future where swarms of robots work together to build flood barriers, pollinate crops, monitor coral reefs and form constellations of satellites.", "author": "Radhika Nagpal", "keywords": "TED, talks, AI, robots, fish, future, ants, science, intelligence, innovation, insects", "talk_id": "2870", "lang": ["en", "es", "fa", "pt-BR", "ru", "zh-Hans", "tr", "fr", "ko", "zh-Hant", "de", "ar", "uk", "ja", "vi", "it"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/RadhikaNagpal_2017", "views": "1,266,753"}
