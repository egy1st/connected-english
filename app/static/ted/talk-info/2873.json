In this moving, poetic talk, OluTimehin Adegbeye details how government land grabs are destroying the lives of thousands who live in the coastal communities of Lagos, Nigeria, to make way for a \"new Dubai.\" She compels us to hold our governments and ourselves accountable for keeping our cities safe for everyone. \"The only cities worth building, indeed the only futures worth dreaming of, are those that include all of us, no matter who we are or how we make homes for ourselves,\" she says.", "author": "OluTimehin Adegbeye", "keywords": "TED, talks, activism, Africa, government, cities, poverty, social change", "talk_id": "2873", "lang": ["en", "fr", "ro", "zh-Hant", "nl", "hr", "vi", "pt-BR", "af", "es", "ru", "ko", "tr", "uk", "el", "it", "zh", "ar", "fa", "de", "cs", "ja", "zh-Hans"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/OluTimehinAdegbeye_2017G", "views": "2,448,327"}
