It doesn't, says Olu\u0301fe\u0301\u0323mi Ta\u0301i\u0301wo\u0300 -- it has a knowledge crisis. Ta\u0301i\u0301wo\u0300 suggests that lack of knowledge on important topics like water and food is what stands between Africa's current state and a future of prosperity. In a powerful talk, he calls for Africa to make the production of knowledge within the continent rewarding and reclaim its position as a locus of learning on behalf of humanity.", "author": "Olu\u0301fe\u0301\u0323mi Ta\u0301i\u0301wo\u0300", "keywords": "TED, talks, Africa, history, library, leadership, agriculture, resources, philosophy, society, rivers, water", "talk_id": "2881", "lang": ["en", "fa", "pt-BR", "fr", "pt", "ar", "it", "es", "ko", "zh-Hant", "ka", "zh-Hans"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/OlufemiTaiwo_2017G", "views": "1,150,727"}
