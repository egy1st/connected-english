Applying his knowledge of photography to subjects just five millimeters long, Biss created a process for shooting insects in unbelievable microscopic detail. He shares the resulting portraits -- each comprised of 8- to 10,000 individual shots -- and a story about how inspiration can come from the most unlikely places.", "author": "Levon Biss", "keywords": "TED, talks, art, animals, creativity, insects, photography", "talk_id": "2885", "lang": ["en", "pt", "fr", "ro", "my", "sr", "ar", "sv", "pt-BR", "es", "hu", "ru", "fa", "he", "de", "zh-Hant", "uk", "zh-Hans", "it", "ja", "ko", "tr", "pl", "vi"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/LevonBiss_2017", "views": "1,227,213"}
