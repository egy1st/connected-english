Even after being diagnosed with anxiety and depression, Webber Allen felt too ashamed to tell anybody, keeping her condition a secret until a family tragedy revealed how others close to her were also suffering. In this important talk about mental health, she speaks openly about her struggle -- and why communities of color must undo the stigma that misreads depression as a weakness and keeps sufferers from getting help.", "author": "Nikki Webber Allen", "keywords": "TED, talks, activism, community, depression, TED Residency, identity, illness, personal growth, race, social change, mental health", "talk_id": "2889", "lang": ["en", "fa", "sw", "sr", "my", "pt", "tr", "fr", "hr", "pt-BR", "ru", "hu", "ro", "de", "nl", "es", "he", "mr", "el", "zh-Hant", "it", "ja", "zh-Hans", "ko", "ps", "uk", "ar", "hi", "bg", "id", "sk", "te", "th", "vi", "ku"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/NikkiWebberAllen_2017S", "views": "2,296,856"}
