Longing to get his hands back on his work, he began exploring the zoetrope, a popular 19th-century device that was used to create the illusion of motion long before the arrival of film. In this vibrant talk, he showcases his resulting art inventions: spinning sculptures and that evoke beautiful, dreamlike scenes. (Warning: This talk includes flashing images and lights. Those who are photosensitive or have seizures trigged by strobes are advised to avoid.)", "author": "Eric Dyer", "keywords": "TED, talks, animation, TEDx, art, creativity, illusion, visualizations, film, movies", "talk_id": "2901", "lang": ["en", "my", "pt-BR", "pt", "es", "sr", "hr", "fr", "ru", "zh-Hant", "tr", "ar", "ja", "hu", "ko", "fa", "vi", "it", "de", "zh-Hans"], "download_link": "https://download.ted.com/talks/EricDyer_2016X", "views": "1,088,766"}
