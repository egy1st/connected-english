He spent his first 20 working years working in and around search, rescue and emergency in Iceland before he turned the page to become a professional photographer. In his talk at TEDxReykjav\u00edk, Siggi explores how photography can help us refocus on current issues and make us see things from a new perspective. \n\nCan a photograph really tell the whole story? Can other people\u2019s images or even your own make you rethink something you thought you already knew? Using examples from his own work with search, rescue and emergency in Iceland and Europe he tries to explain how photography has continued to reshape his view of the world around him.
