With his company Glitchnap, he has been re-imagining mobile device affordances and physical game controllers through multiple projects. He\u2019s been involved in a myriad of events in the indie games scene, both on and off-stage. His personal work explores the way digital technology can create play situations and novel experiences.\n\nIn his talk at TEDxReykjav\u00edk, Joon offers a light-hearted look into a phenomenon from inside youth and gaming culture. A growing community of performers and audience members is coming together over a new type of performance: transgressive play, or rather: playing video games in ways that are clearly not intended by the game\u2019s creators. Joon calls this \u2018breaking the game\u2019 and he believes that there is something for us all to be learned from it. You can find videos and links to the artworks he describes on his website joon.be/tedx.", "author": "Jonatan Van Hove", "keywords": "TED, talks, design", "talk_id": "2937", "lang": [], "download_link": "btitledDownloads\":null,\"audioDownload\":null},\"duration\":0,\"event\":\"TEDxReykjavik\",\"institute_partner_name\":null,\"salon_partner_name\":null,\"event_badge\":null,\"is_featured\":false,\"hero\":\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/talkstar", "views": "0"}
