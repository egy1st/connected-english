That distinguishes us from many places, enhances our economy and shapes the way we engage and see one another. We are also a city with longstanding challenges, including significant poverty. What if we were bolder with the arts? Armed with this powerful asset, we can build a stronger community for everyone who lives here - more beautiful, inside and out.\n\nThis talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. It was filmed and edited by Tijo Media at the Carpenter Theatre at Dominion Arts Center in Richmond, VA.", "author": "Melody Barnes", "keywords": "TED, talks, art", "talk_id": "2945", "lang": [], "download_link": "btitledDownloads\":null,\"audioDownload\":null},\"duration\":0,\"event\":\"TEDxRVA\",\"institute_partner_name\":null,\"salon_partner_name\":null,\"event_badge\":null,\"is_featured\":false,\"hero\":\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/talkstar", "views": "0"}
