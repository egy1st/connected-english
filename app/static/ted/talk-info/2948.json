He will provide insight and analysis that has emerged from his own experiences as a Freshmen in high school. Diego  has been analytical towards popularity and \"strange\" behavior in his surroundings. He has observed similarities of his peers to competitive behavior of animals in the wild. He dares to ask: how can humanity be considered so advanced when many other \"lower\" species make cooperation the bedrock of their behavior? Humans, on the other hand, especially adolescents seem to  individually and systemically exclude and take advantage of one another for personal gain.", "author": "Diego Velasquez", "keywords": "TED, talks, global issues", "talk_id": "2948", "lang": [], "download_link": "btitledDownloads\":null,\"audioDownload\":null},\"duration\":0,\"event\":\"TEDxYouth@ANS\",\"institute_partner_name\":null,\"salon_partner_name\":null,\"event_badge\":null,\"is_featured\":false,\"hero\":\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/talkstar", "views": "0"}
