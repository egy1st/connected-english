From his point of view, it is all about a way of thinking that has formed over time in our subconscious and is very well transposed by a phrase often heard in Romania: it would have been too beautiful. The challenges of today require authentic leadership that must be trained by a system adapted to the requirements of the 21st century.", "author": "Sebastian Burduja", "keywords": "TED, talks, education", "talk_id": "2992", "lang": [], "download_link": "btitledDownloads\":null,\"audioDownload\":null},\"duration\":0,\"event\":\"TEDxYouth@PiataEnescu\",\"institute_partner_name\":null,\"salon_partner_name\":null,\"event_badge\":null,\"is_featured\":false,\"hero\":\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/talkstar", "views": "0"}
